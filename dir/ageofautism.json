and she has rare and valuable insight into the landscape of public health today and the government \u2019 s response to the coronavirus .\nThank you for tuning in to part two of our exclusive interview with Vera Sharav , Holocaust survivor and renowned champion for human rights .\nThese government agencies are orchestrating obedience and it is not democratic\u2014it \u2019 s not the product of democracy .\nIt \u2019 s the product of a pharmaceutical-driven , bio-security agenda that will enslave the entire human race and plunge us into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance and greed will be running our lives and ruining our children and destroying all the dreams and dignity that we hope to give to our children .\nVera very much echoes the words of Robert Kennedy , Jr. when he said , recently , In Part One ( HERE ) Vera called everyone to stand up against the growing forces bent on taking away our rights .\nHere she expands on the topic with chilling examples of what \u2019 s at stake for all of us .\nThank you to Anne Dachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Below is a transcription of Part Two of a video interview with health freedom advocate , Vera Sharav .\nVera Sharav , a medical activist , is the founder of the Alliance for Human Research Protection , and an activist against some practices of the biomedical industry , particularly in matters of patient consent and children .\nIn this second segment , Vera draws parallels to what she seeing happening today and what her family saw in Nazi Germany .\nShe also talks about the dangers of using children and minorities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindly following authority , and what we can do to protect ourselves , our children and the most vulnerable among us .\nI hope you enjoy the second part of my conversation with Vera .\nVera Sharav : This is a eugenics way of looking at the world .\nEugenics was exported from the United States to Nazi Germany .\nIt never , never was abandoned ; it just got its name changed .\nThere are all kinds of institutions that essentially continue to push the eugenics agenda with policies that they easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations are targeted for weeding out those who you consider lesser , inferior .\nPeople of color in the United States have in fact been very much targeted for medical experiments that were anything but medicine , that were really criminal .\nEveryone knows about Tuskegee , but black and Hispanic children have been used as guinea pigs repeatedly in experiments that should never ever have been done .\nIs it too explosive or whatever to compare Nazism ?\nI \u2019 m sorry , this is what Nazism was about .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they did things when they began with the children .\nThe Jews , in the Nazi order , were the despised minority .\nAnd here we have the blacks and Hispanics being treated like a despised minority , like their lives don \u2019 t count .\nWe have to stop it , and this might be the trigger .\nIf the African American community gets up and says no and really says no , and we help them to say no , that \u2019 s very important .\nLeah : Vera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , to reach their goal of \u201c Leave No One Behind , Immunization Agenda 2030 , \u201d is to eliminate vaccine exemptions across the United States .\nThis is a state issue , but we \u2019 re seeing the trend sweep the U.S. to eliminate religious exemptions , medical exemptions even .\nWhat do you say to those who don \u2019 t yet see the not so obvious concern of giving up autonomy and giving up rights to make your own health care decisions ?\nVera : Every word there is exactly\u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Nazi regime .\nIt \u2019 s the same .\nAt this point there are already so many , tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of children who \u2019 ve been damaged by vaccines .\nMore parents will come into contact with someone , whether it \u2019 s in their own extended family or neighbors or school children who are damaged .\nThey need to think very , very hard about , is it the right thing to do to obey authority , because those authorities bear absolutely no responsibility .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one who has responsibility is you .\nYou \u2019 re left with the medical bills , You \u2019 re left with the heartache of having a children that \u2019 s never going to have a normal life .\nSo to entrust the schools or a doctor who doesn \u2019 t bear any of the problems when things go wrong .\nDo you really want to play Russian roulette with your child \u2019 s life ?\nWe \u2019 re talking about their life .\nSome of these abnormalities that are caused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just so enormous that you better think really hard whether it might not be a good idea to find out more of the evidence .\nThere are articles .\nThose vaccines also have labels ; they don \u2019 t give them to you .\nYou have to make sure to get them , to read them and maybe have a lawyer look over and get that kind of advice .\nOnce your child is harmed from the things that are in the vaccines , it \u2019 s not necessarily the virus that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a whole lot of other elements in vaccines , including fetal tissue , including different animal tissue .\nThere are a whole lot of things in vaccines that have never ever been tested for safety in children .\nIt \u2019 s a very , very dark area .\nVaccines don \u2019 t undergo the kind of safety trials that drugs do .\nNo vaccine on the children \u2019 s schedule has ever been tested against a real placebo , saline , saline placebo .\nThey \u2019 re tested against other vaccines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vaccine but are not the virus .\nThose adjuvants very often are the thing that cause the most damage .\nLeah : And just because a vaccine is state mandated , you \u2019 re saying , does not change who \u2019 s responsible for the child .\nIt does not shift responsibility .\nIn fact , not only does the state not have responsibility ; the manufacturers do not have responsibility .\nLeah : Can there truly be immunity when the state is mandating the vaccine be given to school age children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered the information that is known already .\nThey \u2019 re not being given that information .\nThey \u2019 re being told , \u201c It \u2019 s fine .\nIt \u2019 s been found to be safe and effective.\n\u201d That \u2019 s the mantra : Safe and effective .\nEvery vaccine that we recommend to you , safe and effective .\nThe fact that there are thousands of children who are damaged , you really can \u2019 t write them off .\nAnd that number keeps growing .\nLeah : Startling .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that child but for the entire family .\nVaccines are not studied with their synergistic effects in combination with the rest of the childhood schedule .\nThey \u2019 re also not studied for their cancer-causing effects , impairment of fertility or mutagenic effects .\nSo , in your opinion , does that make children who receive vaccines unwilling research subjects ?\nThey refuse to conduct a trial that compares vaccinated against unvaccinated children and see which ones are healthier .\nYou \u2019 re not willing to do so because you know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unvaccinated .\nThey \u2019 re the healthier ones .\nLeah : Issues like this\u2014 Historically you \u2019 ve had a lot of success with getting the press attention , but now the pharmaceutical industry has such huge influence over not only the media and the press , but over government and lawmakers and the government advisors , and even the medical industry associations .\nWhat voice do the parents , as stakeholders , have left ?\nVera : Even though they \u2019 re censoring a lot even on social media , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media are those big corporations that have partnerships with pharmaceuticals or with Gates .\nHe owns a lot of the media now .\nNevertheless , there are websites .\nThere are organizations that do provide legitimate information .\nParents need to address them .\nThey need to go to them .\nThey need to find them .\nLeah : I hear a lot with the moms in our circles that the first question they ask when becoming curious about their child \u2019 s health decisions and making decisions independently , \u201c Don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to go to school ?\n\u201d And that \u2019 s where we have to make moms aware that that can \u2019 t be the determining factor .\nVera : They need to rebel .\nIf enough rebel , it won \u2019 t happen .\nUnless African Americans had marched on Washington with Martin Luther King , it would have not changed .\nIt would have gotten worse and worse and worse .\nEven though we still have a lot of racism in society , it is not the same as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started with a revolution .\nThat was their rebellion against the mother state , against England .\nSo where is that spirit now ?\nPeople who are dependent on government are kind of the first victims .\nThey have the least options .\nSo it \u2019 s difficult to kind of put it on them .\nI think that middle class , educated people , who do have options , who have been able to work from home and maintain their income , they have choices .\nThey have options and it behooves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life .\nMany times , not only the Holocaust , really , there are many crossroads , many points in life where you have to make choices .\nAnd if you don \u2019 t , someone who will make the choice for you is not going to make it for your best interest .\nJust be aware of that .\nYou and your child , the parent in most , ninety-nine percent of cases , has the best interest of the child .\nYes , there are some abusive parents , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere near even the smallest minority , because that \u2019 s against nature .\nI \u2019 m a very strong believer that you don \u2019 t go against the natural instincts .\nUse your natural instinct .\nThat \u2019 s what I learned as I was six years old .\nGo by your instinct .\nIt \u2019 s probably your best guide if you have no other .\nBetter still of course , get informed .\nGet informed so that you \u2019 ll be armed with accurate information that you can argue against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm you forever .\nLeah : I \u2019 ve heard you say we \u2019 re at a crossroads in history .\nVera : This is exactly the crossroad that we are now [ at ] .\nEither we go along , as so far as most people have , or we say , enough .\nLet \u2019 s look back at this COVID .\nInitially the lockdowns happened because they followed Professor Neil Ferguson at the Imperial College of London .\nHe had projected that there would be two and a half million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 510 thousand in the U.K. Not only did it turn out to be completely , completely off base\u2014totally , not even close , but Professor Ferguson has a record of similar disasters that his predictions caused .\nThe first one was in 2001 when he predicted that 50,000 in the U.K. would hoof and mouth disease from the cattle and that you had to slaughter the cattle .\nSo they went and slaughtered millions of sheep and cows .\nNo such thing happened .\n\u2026 Then it was SARS .\nAgain he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that tell you ?\nAnd this is the world expert : an epidemiologist that his mathematical calculations were the things that everybody went by , but he has been wrong over and over again .\nSo I asked myself , why would you go with someone who has really an absurd track record ?\nJust one disaster after another .\nI found out the answer .\nHe gets millions of dollars every year from the Bill Gates Foundation .\nSo he had an exact model to follow in order to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic .\nIt was totally false .\nSo when the media talks about fake news and anti-vaxx and all that , no , no , no .\nNone of us are against vaccine per se .\nWe want them to be safe , and we want to have a choice as to which ones we think we need because we might be exposed to that disease , and which ones we don \u2019 t need .\nAnd we certainly wouldn \u2019 t want to have our infants get tetanus shots and hepatitis B.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in the dirt with nails , and they \u2019 re not exchanging needles .\nThese are infants .\nThis is the way to expand the market .\nThe market is too small for tetanus And who are the most vulnerable ?\nRight there in the delivery room .\nThat \u2019 s not a time where the mother can make a choice .\nShe should be given the opportunity to make that choice before she enters that birthing room .\nLeah : The justification is if we get maximum uptake , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s for the better .\nHowever , is there ever a higher morality than making the best decision for that child ?\nVera : But even that , they \u2019 re conflating .\nTetanus is not catching , so there \u2019 s no herd immunity .\nLeah : And hepatitis B is not spread in the classroom .\nVera : That \u2019 s right exactly , and it \u2019 s the same thing with HPV .\nI mean , once people understand that what is ruling this entire thing is a business model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they have a captured audience and a captured market because the government hands it to them .\nThat \u2019 s what has happened .\nThe government now doesn \u2019 t represent us .\nThe govern is there to enforce what Bill Gates and the pharmaceutical companies want .\nWe never voted for them .\nWe never gave our approval to them ; we weren \u2019 t asked .\nThe

of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat kind of peer review wouldn \u2019 t realize that there was no data really ?\nLeah : What does the accountability look like when they \u2019 re caught with the fraud

retracted it even .\nThey were forced to retract because it was just so absurd .\nLeah : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you value the sanctity of life and that you \u2019 ve gone to bat for millions and same that will never even know .\nVera : I guess some of us are kind of propelled , an inner feeling that if I don \u2019 t do it , how could I expect then that others should have done better when I was in

schooled in the same way\u2026 An expert at the very least should be one who \u2019 s most of the time right .\nI would think that would be like the first thing right ?\nIf one after another , you \u2019 re wrong and by zillions ; I mean we \u2019 re not talking about a little bit wrong .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that person and those persons are called experts .\nThey help to create panic in order to set the stage for mandatory whatever the government says , that \u2019 s it .\nWhat wants to live in that kind of a society ?\nWho wants to live cooped up the way we \u2019 ve been , when it shouldn \u2019 t have been that way in the first place ?\nReal scientists , independent scientists have been arguing the [ lockdowns ] , against all this nonsense that destroyed the economy .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people committing suicide , there \u2019 s violence within the family .\nNot everyone has a nice spacious apartment .\nPeople with three children , four children and cooped it , it gets on your nerves .\nYou know , they don \u2019 t have a way to let out their energy because parents are afraid to let them out .\nThat \u2019 s outrageous to have a breakdown of society because of a virus that isn \u2019 t anything like what we \u2019 ve been led to believe .\nThey want control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we should become robots .\nAnd let \u2019 s understand that \u2026the Bill Gates crowd of multi-billionaires , and it seems that there have been more billionaires created in these last ten years since 2008 when there was a again an economic recession .\nThat should tell you something .\nThey consider themselves an elite , and this is an eugenics way of looking at the world .\nEugenics was exported from the United States to Nazi Germany .\nIt never , never was abandoned .\nIt just got its name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s a population council .\nThere are all kinds of institutions that essentially continue to push the eugenics agenda with policies that they easily set because of the money .\nSo some populations are targeted for weeding out .\nThat \u2019 s the eugenics kind of way of reducing populations .\nYou weed out those who you consider lesser , you know , inferior .\nLeah : So I hear you saying a few things about teaching others to think about what makes them an expert , when we \u2019 re listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what makes this situation different than what we \u2019 ve seen before .\nVera : On a larger scale , it \u2019 s a more insidious scale because a lot of it is electronic .\nWe don \u2019 t really see it .\nYou don \u2019 t have to have quite as many Gestapo around .\nThey can do things without that now .\nReally the electronic way of doing things gives them much more control .\nWe know that everything , Facebook , , all of those models , the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank .\nLeah : Vera , what do you think about the notion that we \u2019 ve been hearing , first from Melinda Gates , of giving the black community the first round of COVID-19 vaccines , after the health care workers ?\nVera : We have to be clear that the African American community and also people of color in the United States have in fact been very much targeted for medical experiments that were anything but medicine , that were really criminal .\nLet me explain .\nEveryone knows about Tuskegee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nChildren , black and Hispanic children have been used as guinea pigs repeatedly in experiments that should never , ever have been done .\nLet me give you some examples .\nYou talked about the New York City children who given fenfluramine .\nhttps : //www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1162/152651603322781639 That was a drug that was eventually removed from the market .\nThis was done at Columbia University .\nIt was to test whether you could predict violence in little six year old children because they had a sibling who had problems with the law .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tagging a violence tag to these children , boys , they were all boys , who had shown no violence\u2014they were perfectly innocent children\u2014and to expose them to a drug that to this day , I don \u2019 t know what really the connection was going to be because how you react to a drug now is how the drug is acting on you at this point .\nHow could you even fathom what \u2019 s going to happen ten years later in that child ?\nIt \u2019 s going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government sponsored .\nYes , I saw that as a travesty , an absolute travesty .\nDuring the AIDS epidemic black and Hispanic infants and children were used as guinea pigs to test experimental AIDS drugs and vaccines .\nThey were government sponsored .\nSome of them were co-sponsored by pharmaceutical companies , but the government gave its imprimatur to do these .\nThe experiments were conducted at , I think it was , about eight different states .\nMy work on this was New York City because this was a major place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The experiments , these were foster children , children in foster care .\nNow , children in foster care , federal law , which was adopted in 1983 , doesn \u2019 t allow foster care children to be used in medical research unless it is potentially of benefit to them , unless it is something about their condition which wouldn \u2019 t be invasive drugs , but rather psychological .\nBut if they had an illness , and this might help them , then it was allowed .\nOther medical research is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state .\nThey did do that with these children .\nVera : It was after 1983 .\nIt was between 1985 and 2005 .\nNow what they did first of all , they assumed in most case , that the children were infected with HIV because the mothers at birth may have been infected or just shown some symptoms .\nThe tests were very unreliable during that whole period .\nThere were a lot of false positives , and most of the children would have had the mother \u2019 s antibodies but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in fact found out eventually when they did an investigation .\nThe experiments , the drugs and the vaccines that they were testing were horrific .\nChildren older than the infants who tried to run away , who resisted , they took them and inserted a plastic tube into their abdomen so that they could not refuse .\nThey tethered them essentially .\nThat \u2019 s torture .\nThere are both national and international laws against torture , and this is torture of these little children .\nThe directive was completely against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care child , if they \u2019 re in research , they have to have a personal advocate as well as informed consent .\nThis committee was told there \u2019 s no need for individual informed consent .\nYou can just do consent for the group .\nThat \u2019 s applying herd methods to human beings .\nThese little babies , and eventually because the media at that time did do some stories which I worked on , the city contracted the Vera Institute\u2014I have nothing to do with it\u2014but the Vera Institute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed\u2014 I also filed a complaint with the federal .\nI always did that .\nFederal found that the children didn \u2019 t have personal advocates as required by law .\nThey found a few things , but again these agencies are essentially , they work together with these hospitals .\nThey work together .\nAll the grants were coming from federal government so even though this Office of Human Research Protection is supposed to be separate , they \u2019 re not really separate .\nThey are employees of the Department of Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones who are also giving the grants .\nBut they found a few things , and then the Vera Institute found a bit more .\nThey found 80 children died .\nNobody investigated what they died of .\nIt was assumed that it was AIDS .\nThere was this nurse who worked at Incarnation House .\nThis was near Columbia , a home for foster children run by Catholic Charities , and she adopted two children .\nTwo of those children she adopted .\nThey were on massive drugs , cocktails of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape .\nOnce she had them in her home which had a backyard , she slowly started to wean the children from the drugs .\nAnd low and behold , they thrived .\nThey thrived .\nWhat did Children \u2019 s Protective Services do ?\nThey came and they took away the children , and she never saw them again .\nVera : She wasn \u2019 t complying with the protocol .\nShe was devastated .\nShe really felt that she could save them .\nSo in order not to have that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the children away .\n\u2026don \u2019 t know whether they survived or what .\nThat \u2019 s a crime .\nI mean this\u2014 you asked before is it too explosive or whatever to compare Nazism .\nI \u2019 m sorry .\nThis is what Nazism was about .\nThis is how they did things .\nThis is how they did things when they began with the children .\nThe Jews in the Nazi order were the despised minority .\nAnd here we have the blacks and Hispanics being treated like a despised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t count .\nI found several articles , later reports in the journals which in fact found that some of the children didn \u2019 t have HIV or anything .\nSo there they were .\nThere was absolutely no justification for the use of these children in experimental , such very , very toxic drugs and a vaccine that was never developed .\nEach one of them was not safe and effective .\nLeah : So how do we stand up for these issues in terms of , in this day and age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , we \u2019 re seeing specific minorities being targeted ?\nVera : You have to stop it , and this might be the trigger .\nIf the African American community gets up and says no and really says no , and we help them to say no .\nThat \u2019 s very important .\nThen we could stop the whole mandate .\nIn other words , the minorities where they think they can get away with more , they do .\nAnd they test the most toxic stuff on them because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings , as having worth .\nIt \u2019 s very , very important that people get together and realize that there are people who will do anything , they will do anything to make money and to control .\nThis is really now about control .\nIt behooves us to stand up .\nPeople still have the ability right now to stand up and to let them know this won \u2019 t fly .\nThis has to be a citizens \u2019 uprising .\nIt \u2019 s that simple .\nOtherwise why talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society ?\nWe \u2019 re not .\nThis is what we \u2019 re about to lose if we allow it .\nVera : What is so amazing to me and very painful to realize is , it \u2019 s one thing when you see the societies in the Far East , you know , Japan , Singapore , China , that \u2019 s their tradition to be submissive to authority .\nBut that wasn \u2019 t the American way .\nAmerica was the exact opposite .\nAnd now we \u2019 re going along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe lockdown is very , very harmful to more people than it is profitable .\nIt \u2019 s only a few who are profiting , but they call the shots because they invaded everything .\nThey are in all government , in local , state and federal .\nWe see part of this sheepish like subservience is part of the problem of our education system .\nChildren are not really encouraged to stand up and insist that they are right .\nNo , they \u2019 re supposed to be subservient , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boys , who don \u2019 t want to say no , they \u2019 re being hushed and drugged .\nAnd the schools aren \u2019 t teaching them .\nThey really are not encouraging self-thinking .\nYou know , thinking a problem through and coming to their own conclusion and then feeling that they know that they \u2019 re right .\nThey \u2019 re not being encouraged to do that .\nThey \u2019 re being encouraged to simply repeat what the teacher says .\nIt is conditioning .\nThis is psychological conditioning to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new edict , whether it \u2019 s the governor , the President , whoever .\nAnd they are maintaining this high level of panic .\nA parent should say , I choose not to vaccinate my child for this and that and the other vaccine .\nLeah : And when more of us become confident in what we choose then the shaming can start to subside .\nVera : Exactly .\nWe are shaming people into line is so antithetical to a democratic process .\nThere should be lively debate , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lose the debate .\nThat \u2019 s why they won \u2019 t do it .\nWe \u2019 re at a crossroads .\nI mean there \u2019 s nothing instead of standing up yourself .\nI mean nobody else will come and give it on a platter .", "author": "Age

Covid", "content": "While the risk to healthy children is less , healthy unvaccinated children who do not receive the vaccine can get\u2014and transmit\u2014the virus both to vulnerable classmates , for example , children with medical conditions that put them at high risk if they get COVID-19 , and to high-risk teachers ( such as the teacher , administrator , or janitor who is over 60 years old , those who are immunocompromised or have conditions like diabetes or heart disease ) .\nThere may be additional risks not yet discovered , for example , recent findings from the UK suggest that COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in children , though the data are yet too limited to be certain .\nIt is unclear what age COVID-19 vaccines will be recommended for , but if adolescents , there may be more of an argument for autonomy and in that case , it is worth considering not just a mandate , but the right of a minor to consent to a vaccine over parental opposition .\n\u2026 Autonomy focuses on the right of individuals to govern their own behavior and requires both ability to comprehend the choice , the alternatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations .\nChildren generally have less autonomy than adults , because their capacity to make decisions is less .\nThe autonomy in question here is that of parents to make medical decisions for their children and that autonomy is more limited , since the primary focus is on the child \u2019 s benefit , with the parent or guardian acting as their agent .\nDr. Caplan has an interesting view on ethical issues and mandating the COVID vaccine , as shown in this piece , Considerations in mandating a new Covid-19 vaccine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 2020 , co-authored with Dorit Reiss from the University of California , Hastings .\nBy Anne Dachel Dr. Arthur Caplan is the head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York .\nHe is an ardent proponent of vaccines and strongly denies any link between vaccines and the development of autism .\n\u2026 utilitarianism\u2014acting for the benefit of the greatest number for society as a whole\u2014supports a COVID-19 mandate , as it supports other vaccine mandates\u2026 .\nThe lengthy piece basically concluded that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the way to go .\nIn short , depending on the features of the vaccine , there may be good ethical grounds to mandate a COVID-19 vaccine , as long as the risk is low , and access is readily available .\nOur jurisprudence suggests that states will face few , if any , legal barriers in doing so , and the past political fights brought on by anti-vaccination groups are likely to be significantly weakened by the unparalleled intensity of the COVID-19 crisis .\nA week later , Dr. Caplan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview .\nCaplan basically rejected the feasibility of a vaccine for COVID-19 in the near future .\nHere was a top expert in the U.S. casting serious doubt on our mad rush for a massive vaccine rollout and he doesn \u2019 t get top story coverage here .\nInstead we have vaccine researcher Peter Hotez .\ntelling us that not only will the COVID-19 vaccines protect us against the current virus but also new variants coming along .\nOver seven months ago Arthur Caplan said that just isn \u2019 t going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minutes , Australia : Scientist says a coronavirus vaccine in just 12 months is 'fake news' 60 Minutes Australia : Right now there \u2018 s one thing all 8 billion of us on earth wish for , a vaccine for COVID-19 .\nAround the world political leaders , sweating on getting us to the other side of the pandemic , promise it will happen within 12 to 18 months .\nBut hold on a minute .\nVaccines normally take decades to formulate , and quite often success never comes .\nSo why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists say talk of a coronavirus vaccine is not only raising false hope ; it \u2019 s fake news\u2026 .\nFor a planet and its population in lockdown , it \u2019 s our one sure way back to normal .\n\u2026 But are we being sold a lie ?\nAfter all , COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus to strike mankind , and we \u2019 ve never found a vaccine for any of them .\n\u2026 The shortest time anybody \u2019 s ever found a vaccine against any disease that I \u2019 m familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be talking about a magic bullet coming in months , it borders on the absurd .\n60 Minutes Australia : Professor Arthur Caplan is director of medical ethics at New York University .\nDr. Caplan : I \u2019 m not saying don \u2019 t spend the money .\nI \u2019 m not saying don \u2019 t do the research .\nBut we can \u2019 t plan public policy on a miracle .\n60 Minutes Australia : Right now there are about a hundred medical teams around the world , including Australia , chasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a COVID vaccine .\nSurely one of them will find it .\nDr. Caplan : Look , viruses are very clever .\nWe have no AIDS vaccine right now .\nWe \u2019 ve been looking for that for more than 25 years .\nThere \u2019 s no vaccine for hepatitis C. Even the flu vaccine we \u2019 ve got , which we \u2019 ve been working on for decades , is about 40 percent effective in a good year .\nThere \u2019 s no guarantee we will find something to beat this virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of teams work on this , it \u2019 s going to give somebody the breakthrough , that doesn \u2019 t follow .\nDr. Frances Lund : You have the whole world working on it , so this is not a disease that is a neglected disease .\nEverybody and their brother is working on it , right ?\nSo there are about a hundred vaccines that people are looking at very hard right now .\nI think one of them will work .\n\u2026 We \u2019 re one of only a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine .\n\u2026 You develop immunity at the site where you \u2019 re going to get infected\u2026 .\nDr. Caplan : I don \u2019 t think the hunt for a vaccine is a waste of time , but I think it \u2019 s a waste of time to act as if we \u2019 re going to get something in six months or 12 months or 18 months for everyone in the world .\nAnd we will need billions of doses of whatever they find if we \u2019 re going to knock the plague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 d need 300 million or more doses 60 Minutes Australia : But this company in Canada may have found a way of producing vaccine doses in the tens of millions quickly and cheaply .\n\u2026 60 Minutes Australia : Finding a vaccine , as impossible as that may sound right now , is only the first step .\nRemember , this is something that \u2019 s going to have to be injected , somehow delivered to most of the world \u2019 s population .\nIf we get it wrong , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apocalypse .\nDr. Caplan : You get one shot and one shot only .\nYou get one opportunity here .\nIf you create something that isn \u2019 t safe and it sickens people , getting people to go for the next vaccine will be next to impossible .\nTo achieve the impossible both in the time frame the timeframe the politicians are promising and to ensure the safety of the vaccine , some , like Professor Caplan , are advocating a radical and highly risky strategy : deliberately infecting healthy volunteers to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s called a challenge study and it \u2019 s rarely been done in medical history .\nDr. Caplan : If you immunize people and then deliberately give them the virus , deliberately you infect them , pick people who are young and very unlikely to die , then you know .\nYou get an answer .\nWe have , if you will , a setup to speed up by months , if not years , the ability to find that vaccine .\n\u2026 Right now there \u2019 s a website that \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies .\nI do think the problem is not going to be getting the volunteers ; it \u2019 s going to be making the decision that it \u2019 s ethical to do this\u2026 .\nI think you could the process by anywhere from six months to a couple of years because , remember you \u2019 re talking about tens and tens of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands of people dying over that period of time .\n\u2026 I think it \u2019 s time , given this enormous plague and the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s causing , to look for that kind of heroism again .\n60 Minutes Australia : In a sense , the world doesn \u2019 t have a choice .\nThe question can \u2019 t be IF we find a vaccine , but when , no matter how many billions of dollars and man hours it takes .\nIf we don \u2019 t , we face a future of lockdowns , social distancing and recurring COVID pandemics for years , if not decades to come .\n\u2026 Dr.Caplan : Politicians , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.K. , Australia , other countries , they want to be optimistic .\nTelling people to lock themselves up for a year and a half while we try to wait this thing out , is probably impossible and they know that .\nSo they quickly turned to talk about vaccines and magic bullets as a way to give us hope .\nI \u2019 m not against hope , but when you talk about vaccinating the world in 12 months , I think you \u2019 re fantasizing

are not vaccines .\nYes , they are being called vaccines , but this is to bypass the regulatory requirements for a medical device .\nThis \u2018 vaccine \u2019 is actually a medical device that has never been used in humans before and rushed to market without any appreciation for what it will do either in the short term or long term .\nThis injection is also being called a vaccine to gain more acceptance , because most people assume that all vaccines are safe and effective .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So if it is a vaccine , it must be safe and effective for ending the pandemic .\nSome sources have indicated the adverse event rate for COVID-19 injections is as high as 80 percent , and that would include all the minor adverse events .\nBut if the short-term adverse event rate is 80 percent , what is in store for the long term ?\nThey honestly don \u2019 t know and really don \u2019 t care .\nPolitics and eugenics , not science or good public health practices , are what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tuskegee incident by a billion-fold .\nWhile this is an over simplification , a vaccine , as defined by the CDC & FDA , is procedure that introduces into the body a foreign protein or weakened virus or bacteria and activates the immune system to make antibodies to same .\nIn theory , to be effective , those antibodies actually have to perform in a useful manner .\nIf it works as advertised , a vaccine gets in your body and programs itself to attack the infection should it cross your path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disrupt transmission by definition , but the COVID-19 injection does not encourage your body to program your immune system .\nInstead , it is the program .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

the movie Rainman , our professor noted that it may be cause by vaccines .\nI made a mental note , and decided to look into it when I had kids someday .\n1991 By the opening of the 1990s the

National Academy of Sciences and edited by none other than Harvard 's Harvey Fineberg : This inquiry , to my knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by US health authorities on vaccine-autism causation .\nThey published : The committee identified no case reports or other studies of autism following pertussis immunization .\nThe sources examined include the CDC 's MSAEFI system , which received no reports of autism ( ICD 9 code 299.0 ) occurring within 28 days of DPT immunization from 1978 to 1990 , a period in which approximately 80.1 million doses of DPT vaccine were administered through public mechanisms in the United States ( J. Mullen , Centers for Disease Control , personal communication , 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases within 28 days of DPT immunization is not surprising , however , given that a diagnosis of autism is difficult , if not impossible , before age 3 years .\nNo data were identified that address the question of a relation between vaccination with DPT or its pertussis component and autism .\nThere are no experimental data bearing on a possible biologic mechanism .\nThere is no evidence to indicate a causal relation between DPT vaccine or the pertussis component of DPT vaccine and autism.\n\u201d Of course they would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regression , because the CDC 's MSAEFI system , as they noted , only followed children for 28 days , and no child is diagnosed with autism within 28 days of onset .\nIt is unheard of for a child to to even get an evaluation scheduled , must less completed in 28 days .\nSo the system would not pick up any cases of vaccine induced autism .\nThis began the age of government obfuscation in vaccine-autism causation .\nThe NIH funded project reported \u201c no evidence \u201d before they began any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the current false narrative and revisionist history pushed by health authorities , mainstream medicine , and their media partners , magically erases a half century of history and discovers the vaccine-autism causation theory for the first time .\nWakefield simply did what Kanner did in 1943 .\nTook patient histories , and including parental reports in a paper .\nA great irony of course in the excoriation of Wakefield for the

rubella vaccine and the syndrome described .\nVirological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue.\n\u201d The greatest irony is that in his case series describing his observation of bowel disease in children with ASD , is that gut dysbiosis and inflammation are the two chief physical commodities in autism according to the medical establishment .\nThe 1990s saw a dramatic rise in autism , from a rare disorder with only 11 cases diagnosed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 and 3 per 10,000 in the 70s and 80s , to approximately 1 in 250 cases by the end of the 20th century .\nIn the UK the

USPHS ) issued a joint statement through the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) on mercury and vaccines .\nThey stated that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c some children could be exposed to a cumulative level of mercury over the first six months of life that exceeds one of the federal guidelines.\n\u201d The truth was that the amount of mercury in the childhood vaccination schedule grossly exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency \u2019 s ( EPA ) maximum daily adult exposure for methylmercury , the form of mercury most closely related to thimerosal for which the government had established a guideline .\nThe EPA sets the daily limit at 0.1 micrograms per kilogram of weight .\nBased on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilograms ( eleven pounds ) at two months of age should not receive more than 0.5 micrograms of mercury on the day of a doctor \u2019 s visit .\nAt the time the AAP and USPHS joint statement was issued , infants at their two-month visit routinely received 62.5 micrograms of THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT AND MEDIA 207 mercury , or 125 times the EPA \u2019 s limit .\nStudies have suggested that , for thimerosal ( ethylmercury ) , \u201c the accepted reference dose should be

safety claim before it had begun to look for evidence of harm .\nIn November 1999 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) initiated a study to evaluate whether children receiving the

\u201c no evidence of harm \u201d claim .\nThe CDC did not publish the results until 2003 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ found an association between higher doses of thimerosal and neurodevelopmental disorders .\nIn the second phase of his study , Verstraeten described his findings as \u201c neutral.\n\u201d Verstraeten was an employee of vaccine maker GlaxoSmithKline by the time his study was finally published .\n\u201c Given that the risks of not vaccinating children far outweigh the unknown and much smaller risk , if any , of exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines over the first six months of life , clinicians and parents are encouraged to immunize all infants even if the choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason.\n\u201d With this single statement , the government took the position that the risk posed to children from exposure to thimerosal was both \u201c unknown \u201d and a \u201c smaller risk \u201d than exposure to childhood diseases .\nThis suggested that public health officials could perform a risk-benefit analysis with no risk information for half of the equation .\nOn what basis could HHS make this statement ?\nIt had not done ( and still has not done ) the underlying research to show that these children were not at risk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWithout hard evidence , the government nonetheless seemed eager to reassure parents that \u201c no evidence of harm \u201d meant \u201c no harm \u201d \u2014even as it failed to look for evidence .\nThe mainstream media did not investigate HHS \u2019 s claims or recommendations , nor did it investigate those of vaccine safety advocates .\nNone of the problems with the joint statement , the investigation , or the CDC \u2019 s handling of the thimerosal question came to light until 2005 , when investigative journalist and author David Kirby released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The searing and detailed account exposed the questionable behavior and judgments of the CDC and HHS.11 Likely sensing the potential for public outrage , the CDC quickly took action and posted a notice on its website explaining that it would review the book and respond .\nBy the end of 2005 , however , the CDC had taken the notice down without responding .\nTo this day , no US government agency has offered any response to the book .\nThe Health Resources and Services Administration \u2019 s ( HRSA ) Vaccine Injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine-induced injuries for which the government offers compensation .\nCreated in 1991 , the table has since listed \u201c encephalopathy \u201d as an outcome for the combination MMR ( or any of the various individual measles , mumps , or rubella vaccines ) and for the DTaP ( or any pertussis-containing vaccines ) .\nThe symptoms of this encephalopathy ( a medical term meaning brain disorder , brain damage , or a change in brain functioning ) in a child who is eighteen months or older include a \u201c significantly decreased level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( 1 ) Decreased or absent response to environment ( responds , if at all , only to loud voice or painful stimuli ) ; ( 2 ) Decreased or absent eye contact ( does not fix gaze upon family members or other individuals ) ; or ( 3 ) Inconsistent or absent responses to external stimuli ( does not recognize familiar people or things ) .16 Many parents have reported these symptoms in their previously typically functioning children after neurological regression following measles , mumps , rubella ( MMR ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese parents , however , reported that those symptoms were not used to diagnose their children with a vaccine-induced encephalopathy but rather to diagnose them with autism .\nIn addition , one of the signs of encephalopathy is seizure activity .\nEstimates suggest that one-quarter to one-third of those with an autism diagnosis also suffer from seizures.17 Were \u201c vaccine-induced encephalopathy \u201d and \u201c autism \u201d merely the same phenomenon , described from the vantage point of two different disciplines , medicine and mental health ?\nWere many cases of autism merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of physician training regarding the recognition of vaccine injury ?\nThese questions never surfaced when the media ran stories regarding parental concerns about vaccine-induced autism\u2014that is , until 2008 , when the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program ( VICP ) became national news .\nIn early 2008 , Jon and Terry Poling announced to the press that HHS had conceded their daughter \u2019 s case of vaccine-induced autism .\nTen-year-old Hannah Poling had regressed into autism after receiving nine vaccines in five shots during one office visit .\nThe Polings argued that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and undiagnosed mitochondrial dysfunction and sustained a neurological regression into autism from receiving vaccines at eighteen months of age .\nJon Poling is a well respected neurologist who was at Johns Hopkins at the time , and his wife Terry is a registered nurse and an attorney .\nThe Polings \u2019 medical testing following their daughter \u2019 s regression was so thorough and their case so strong that HRSA conceded the case and elected to pay compensation without a hearing before the VICP .\nThe government acknowledged , albeit in very evasive language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to Hannah Poling \u2019 s autism .\nWhile the media had yet to rigorously scrutinize the vaccine-autism story , national and local consumer-safety and autism-awareness groups were organizing to share information and advocate for change .\nWhen CNN broadcast the Polings \u2019 press conference live , the event poured gasoline on the already fiery vaccine safety debate .\nFederal public health officials were forced to comment on how vaccines can not cause autism , even though they seemed to have done just that in little Hannah Poling .\nThe government \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on vaccine induced autism were completely at odds with one another , and the government \u2019 s clumsy and conflicting answers raised even more questions about vaccine safety : \u2022 Did the government deliberately mislead the public about Hannah \u2019 s injury ?\n\u2022 Did the media pursue this news story appropriately ?\nOur government would not say that Hannah had autism , which she indeed does have.18 The concession document19 said that Hannah has \u201c a regressive encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder.\n\u201d 20 By definition , a person diagnosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that disorder .\nGovernment attorneys had full access to Hannah Poling \u2019 s extensive medical files , which disclose that she has DSM-diagnosed , full-syndrome autism .\nYet , they referred to her neurological disorder using terms that sounded ambiguous , as if she has something like autism , but not autism .\nHannah \u2019 s parents repeatedly clarified to the media that their daughter has full-syndrome autism .\nA scientific journal article21 further confirmed her diagnosis .\nWhere was the mainstream media ?\nIt failed in two respects .\nFirst , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ euphemistic words , \u201c autism-like symptoms , \u201d thereby attempting to dodge the burning question\u2014is the dramatic increase in the number of childhood vaccines causing the dramatic increase in autism incidence ?\nSecond , the media gave extensive airtime to vaccine-program defenders who seemed to turn the case on its head , blaming the victim for her own injury .\nIn a twist of logic , they inferred that it wasn \u2019 t really the vaccines \u2019 fault that Hannah was permanently injured ; on the contrary , Hannah was merely a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the New Scientist declared , \u201c Significantly , the government \u2019 s decision says nothing about whether vaccines cause autism .\nInstead , government lawyers concluded only that vaccines aggravated a preexisting cellular disorder in the child , causing brain damage that included features of autism.\n\u201d 22 This vague government pronouncement prompted the tongue-in-cheek response from a commenter , \u201c Do cigarettes only aggravate preexisting genetic factors , causing lung damage including features of cancer ?\n\u201d 23 In late 2010 , reporter Sharyl Attkisson of CBS News summed up HHS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannah \u2019 s injuries , the government said vaccines aggravated an unknown mitochondrial disorder Hannah had which didn \u2019 t \u2018 cause \u2019 her autism , but \u2018 resulted \u2019 in it.\n\u201d 24 A few days after the announcement , CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding appeared on CNN with Dr. Sanjay Gupta to explain the government \u2019 s position on the Poling case and vaccine-autism causation .\nGupta began the interview by noting that a child with regressive autism had been compensated and that the government had conceded that vaccines had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on a key question .\nGupta asked whether Hannah had \u201c autism \u201d or \u201c autism-like symptoms.\n\u201d She instead claimed that she had not read the Poling case file .\nGupta failed to challenge this extraordinary and implausible statement .\nGerberding was at the helm of the government agency responsible for the U.S. vaccine program and reported directly to Congress .\nA government agency conceded that vaccines caused Hannah Poling \u2019 s autism-like symptoms and Gerberding had not read her case file before appearing on national television ?\nIn another extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which vaccines can cause autism : \u201c My understanding is that the child has what we think is a rare mitochondrial disorder and when children have this disease , anything that stresses them creates a situation where their cells just can \u2019 t make enough energy to keep their brains functioning normally .\nNow we all know that vaccines can occasionally cause fevers in kids , so if the child is immunized , got a fever or other complications from the vaccine then , if you are predisposed with a mitochondrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some damage , some of the symptoms can be symptoms that have characteristics of autism.\n\u201d 24 Gerberding had just said that vaccines can cause autism in children with mitochondrial disorders .\nGupta passed right by this statement as well .\nSeeming not to have heard her , he instead asked , \u201c As it stands , are we ready to say that vaccines do not cause autism ?\n\u201d Off the hook of the vaccine-autism causation question , Gerberding quickly responded , \u201c What we can say absolutely , for sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the causes of autism .\nWe \u2019 ve got a long way to go before we get to the bottom of this , but there have been at least 15 very good scientific studies , and the Institute of Medicine which has searched this out and they have concluded that there really is no association between vaccines and autism.\n\u201d 25 Dr. Julie Gerberding , director of the CDC , had just explained an association between vaccines and autism on national news .\nShe then said there is no association between vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CDC had held a conference call with concerned physicians and insurance companies to discuss the Poling case.26 During the call , experts presented information that Hannah \u2019 s preexisting mitochondrial dysfunction may not be so rare .\nAn unpublished study of thirty children with regressive autism revealed that they all shared Hannah \u2019 s same biomarkers.27 On the call , it was estimated that up to one in fifty children , or two percent of the general population , may have a genetic mutation that places them at risk for mitochondrial dysfunction.28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three days when Gerberding gave the CNN interview and made the claim that Hannah \u2019 s condition was \u201c rare , \u201d but Gupta didn \u2019 t challenge her claim .\nIn The Washington Post , Gerberding offered additional , unsubstantiated words of reassurance to a concerned public : \u201c While we recognize , and have recognized , mitochondrial disorders are associated with .\n.\n.\nautism-like syndrome , there is nothing about this situation that should be generalized to the risks of vaccines for normal children.29 \u201d Gerberding failed to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Hannah seemed \u201c normal \u201d before her shots , as did tens of thousands of children who regressed into autism after their shots .\nIn fact , Hannah was above average socially and so highly verbal that , at the age of sixteen months , she had been chosen to be a \u201c typical peer \u201d to model appropriate social skills to developmentally disabled children in an early intervention program .\nMillions of concerned parents wonder about vaccine safety and which of their \u201c normal \u201d children might be at risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know ?\n\u2022 By definition , regressive autism means that the children were , by all appearances , neurologically \u201c normal \u201d before their diagnosis .\nIn the absence of criteria to identify susceptibility , aren \u2019 t all children \u201c normal \u201d before they regress into autism after vaccination ?\n\u2022 How many other children with regressive autism following vaccination have asymptomatic , undiagnosed mitochondrial dysfunction like Hannah Poling ?\nWas Hannah diagnosed only because her father is a neurologist ?\n\u2022 In the Hannah Poling scenario , a seemingly healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her autism .\nAutism affects one percent of all U.S. children .\nWhy aren \u2019 t we screening children before vaccination to make sure they are not susceptible , just like Hannah was ?\nDr. Anne Schuchat , the assistant surgeon general and director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC at the time , answered the last question in an interview in The Atlanta Journal Constitution : '' Some have suggested that infants and children be screened for mitochondrial disorders before getting recommended vaccinations .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is usually not possible to identify children with such disorders until there are signs of developmental decline .\nA definitive diagnosis often requires multiple blood tests and may also require a muscle or brain biopsy ( removal of a portion for testing , usually under anesthesia ) .\nTherefore , providing routine screening tests on children who have no symptoms would bring other medical risks and raise many ethical questions .\n`` 30 Schuchat failed to mention that a simple blood test to screen for \u201c soft biomarkers \u201d of mitochondrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further failed to mention the medical risks and ethical questions raised by blindly vaccinating nearly all children when we know that some will have mitochondrial dysfunction that puts them at risk for neurological injury .\nThe following year , Gerberding resigned from the CDC and joined Merck & Co. , Inc. , the pharmaceutical giant , as head of its vaccine division .\nMerck manufactures several childhood vaccines including the MMR .\nNotably , the MMR is the vaccine HRSA has admitted causes an encephalopathy that progresses into autism , and was among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s regression into autism .\nWhile the autism advocacy community vigorously discussed and debated the Poling concession , Gerberding \u2019 s public statements on vaccine encephalopathy and autism , and her new employment , mainstream media once again remained mute .\nDuring reporter David Kirby \u2019 s investigation of the Poling case , he requested clarification of the government \u2019 s position on whether or not vaccines could cause autism in light of the VICP decision .\nHRSA \u2019 s Office of Communications responded shortly after Gerberding left office with the Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your most recent inquiry , HRSA has the following statement : The government has never compensated , nor has it ever been ordered to compensate , any case based on a determination that autism was actually caused by vaccines .\nWe have compensated cases in which children exhibited an encephalopathy , or general brain disease .\nEncephalopathy may be accompanied by a medical progression of an array of symptoms including autistic behavior , autism , or seizures .\nSome children who have been compensated for vaccine injuries may have shown signs of autism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may ultimately end up with autism or autistic symptoms , but we do not track cases on this basis .\nRegards , David Bowman Office of Communications Health Resources and Services Administration 301-443-337637 '' Bowman asserts that vaccines don \u2019 t cause autism , but that they do cause brain damage that can result in autism .\nHowever , HRSA doesn \u2019 t track that .\nKirby and Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. , published this email , but the mainstream media again failed to report it to the public .\nDespite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC took no measures to review or change it 's approach to the rising rates of both autism and vaccine rejectionism .\nThe CDC 's website in it 's discussion of thimerosal , \u201c There is no convincing evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines , except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site.\n\u201d 40 In carefully crafted , qualified language , the CDC no longer claimed \u201c no evidence of harm \u201d as it did in 1999 but rather that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d implicitly recognizing that there was evidence of harm but the CDC has decided not to be \u201c convinced \u201d by it .\nOn he subject of \u201c Vaccines and Autism \u201d website offered this response to the question , \u201c Do vaccines cause autism spectrum disorders ?\n\u201d \u201c A : [ There are ] many studies that have looked at whether there is a relationship between vaccines and autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) .\nTo date , the studies continue to show that vaccines are not [ sic ] associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accurately depict the state of vaccine safety science .\nWhile some studies do not find evidence of an association between vaccines , heavy metal components such as thimerosal , and autism , many do .\nThe peer-reviewed meta-analysis released by DeSoto and Hitlan , found that 74 percent of the relevant studies support an association between autism and heavy metals such as thimerosal .\nIn March 2010 , while discussing the H1N1 flu , Readers Digest asked HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , \u201c What can be done about public mistrust of vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are groups out there that insist that vaccines are responsible for a variety of problems despite all scientific evidence to the contrary .\nWe have reached out to media outlets to try to get them to not give the views of these people equal weight in their reporting to what science has shown and continues to show about the safety of vaccines.\n\u201d 44 Neither the Obama Administration nor Readers Digest clarified this remarkable disclosure , thus it remains unclear which press outlets HHS contacted , what HHS asked the press not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request .\nIn early 2012 , in preparation for the second edition of Vaccine Epidemic , the CDC was contacted directly to ascertain its current stance on vaccine-autism causation .\nThomas W. Skinner public affairs officer from the Office of the Associate Director for Communication responded : Autism presents difficult challenges for thousands of families across the United States .\nScientists do not know what causes autism .\nHowever , very thorough studies conducted by some of the world \u2019 s brightest scientists simply do not point to an association between vaccines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide answers as to what is the cause or causes of autism.\n\u201d Because this statement was inconsistent with the current research , I sent Mr. Skinner a follow-up email , in which I brought to his attention a list of sixty studies ( listed in appendix starting on page 389 ) that point to an association between vaccines and autism .\nI requested three pieces of information : ( 1 ) the list of studies that \u201c do not point to an association between vaccines and autism ; \u201c ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to mention any of the studies that point to an association between vaccines and autism ; and ( 3 ) the person or panel responsible for approving his statement .\nWhile statements on the relationship between vaccines and autism had became more vague , qualified , and inconclusive over the years , suddenly the CDC became very emphatic on their position on vaccine-autism causation .\nDespite no new information that would justify such an expansive claim coming to light , in September The CDC declared on their web site that , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungry Lie became official US policy .\nThe statement was the subject of much criticism , as of the 14 vaccines on the childhood schedule , only 1 of them , the MMR had had any inquiry undertaking on them that failed to find a link .\nAnd several studies did find links between MMR and autism .\nA review of the positions held by the various HHS departments , the US Secretary of Health and Human Services , held four incompatible positions on the relationship between vaccines and autism , via the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that contribute information to the public on vaccine safety .\nIn answering the question , \u201c Are vaccines linked to autism ?\n\u201d The departments ' answers could be categorized thusly : The Health Resources Services Administration \u2019 s position is : Yes .\nDavid Bowman , a spokesman for HHS \u2019 s Health Resources and Services Administration commenting on a case of vaccine encephalopathy and autism responded : \u201c [ Vaccine Induced ] Encephalopathy may be accompanied by a medical progression of an array of symptoms including autistic behavior , autism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration \u2019 s position can summed up as : Maybe .\nSometimes .\n\u201c Adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , SIDS , anaphylactic reaction , cellulitis , autism , convulsion/grand mal convulsion , encephalopathy , hypotonia , neuropathy , somnolence and apnea .\nEvents were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting .\nBecause these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d The National Institutes of Health \u2019 s position can be characterized as : Probably not .\nWhile NIH has not responded to requests for an official position statement on the matter , Dr. Francis Collins wrote on June 13th 2017 , in his NIH Director \u2019 s Blog , in a post entitled Autism Spectrum Disorder : Progress Toward Earlier Diagnosis : \u201c Research shows that the roots of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) generally start early\u2014most likely in the womb .\nThat \u2019 s one more reason , on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why current claims about the role of vaccines in causing autism can \u2019 t be righti.\n\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphatically asserts : Absolutely not .\nOn their page on the relationship between vaccines and autism : \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism.\n\u201c \u201c Vaccine ingredients do not cause autism.\n\u201d \u201c There is no link between vaccines and autism.\n\u201d THE CHAIRS OF HRSA , CDC , FDA , and NIH Agencies that report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services therefore held multiple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine safety question in the public forum .\nThis should have been enough to trigger a systematic review of the information each agency is using , what biases are causing this wide range of positions , and whether or not fraud is in play .\nFurther , both NIH and CDC , are multiple vaccine patent holders , which is not disclosed to patients or their guardians at the point of sale .\nHHS , while posing as an impartial agency to research , regulate , and recommend vaccines via NIH , FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine court \u201d via HRSA to determine vaccine injury causation in individual consumer claims , is robbing the consumer of informed consent by failing to disclose that it is a profit partner in the very shots that members of the public are allowing to be administered to themselves or their minor children .\nBut even beyond that , these vaccine safety statements ( save Bowman \u2019 s ) ignore the more than a hundred research papers that demonstrate multiple links between vaccines and autism , and the mechanisms by which vaccines and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as at least 83 documented vaccine induced encephalopathy with autism claims paid by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program .\nOn August 27th , following three years of legal pressure from the Informed Consent Action Network , without comment , The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed The Hungry Lie from it 's website where it has lived since 2015 , deceiving hundreds of millions of Americans and parents world wide .\nCDC did not inform ICAN of their action and ICAN was not aware of the retraction until it was noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden Administration .\nThe Informed Consent Action Network issued the following press release detailing their three year effort to take the CDC to task for the false claim : \u201c January 21 , 2021 ICAN , through its attorneys led by Aaron Siri , has been relentless in its legal demands and actions to compel the CDC to remove its blanket claim that \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism \u201d from its website .\nWe are excited to report that the CDC has finally capitulated to those demands !\nIt has removed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-year journey for how ICAN , and its legal team , achieved this result is a story of determined persistence .\nHere are the highlights .\nThe journey began with a letter sent to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services ( HHS ) on October 12 , 2017 .\nThat letter explained why the CDC can not scientifically claim that \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism \u201d on its website .\nICAN then ended with the following demand : \u201c Please confirm that HHS shall forthwith remove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Autism \u2019 from the CDC website , or alternatively , please identify the specific studies on which HHS bases its blanket claim that no vaccines cause autism ?\nTo put HHS and the CDC ( an agency within HHS ) on their heels , mere days after sending this letter , ICAN also sent a FOIA request FOIA request on November 1 , 2017 , demanding : All reports , scientific studies , and any other documents the CDC relied upon to support the assertion \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism \u201d located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The CDC quickly called ICAN \u2019 s counsel , Aaron Siri , regarding this request .\nAfter some negotiations , the CDC formally responded responded on November 7 , 2017 , stating that \u201c A search of our records failed to reveal any documents beyond the records hyperlinked in the specific web site \u201d to support the claim that vaccines do not cause autism .\nThe CDC had thus revealed a truth , one that HHS could not run from in its On January 18 , 2018 , HHS responded to ICAN \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , HHS provided a list of studies it said supported the conclusion on its website that \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism.\n\u201d All of the studies cited related either to a single vaccine , MMR , or to a single vaccine ingredient , thimerosal .\n*None *of these studies support the claim that vaccines given during the first six months of life do not cause autism Given that HHS failed to support its claim that \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism , \u201d ICAN responded by letter dated December 31 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not scientifically claim that \u2018 Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism \u2019 \u201d and \u201c must therefore remove this claim from the CDC website until it can produce the studies to support the claim In order to keep the pressure on to force the CDC to be honest with the public , during the first six months of 2019 , ICAN submitted numerous requests for communications among key personnel within the CDC relating to autism .\nSome of these requests sought emails going back decades .\nThe key players within the CDC with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were watching , and that we would have their unvarnished , internal Now that ICAN had gathered the proof in the form of evidence and admissions it needed to hold the CDC \u2019 s feet to the fire , on June 19 , 2019 , ICAN demanded that the CDC produce copies of the studies it relies upon to claim that all the vaccines given during the first six months of life \u201c Do Not Cause Autism.\n\u201d These vaccines include DTaP , HepB , Hib , PCV13 , and IPV .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies to support that the cumulative exposure to these vaccines during the first six months of life \u201c Do Not Cause Autism .\nICAN , of course , already had the CDC \u2019 s admissions on these points from its prior FOIA request in November 2017 , the HHS letter exchange , and the CDC \u2019 s internal emails .\nThe CDC had nowhere to hide and no way to dissemble .\nAs expected , it responded to ICAN \u2019 s request with the same list of studies involving MMR or thimerosal .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , HepB , Hib , PCV13 , and IPV do not cause autism .\nICAN Battles the CDC in Court ( Dec. 31 , 2019 to March 5 , 2020 ) ICAN then put the pressure directly on the CDC .\nInstead of walking away after the CDC effectively admitted it did not have the studies ICAN The suit focused on the CDC \u2019 s claim that \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism \u201d on the basis that the CDC had not specifically listed the precise studies that it asserts support that claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposition of Dr. Stanley Plotkin , the godfather of vaccinology , who admitted under oath that he was \u201c okay with telling the parent that DTaP/Tdap does not cause autism even though the science isn \u2019 t there yet to support that claim After a lot of wrangling between ICAN \u2019 s counsel Aaron Siri , and the Department of Justice , which was representing the CDC , the CDC finally capitulated and signed a stipulation that entered as an order of the court on March 2 , 2020 in which the CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support it relies upon to claim that DTaP , HepB , Hib , PCV13 , and IPV do not cause autism .\nHere is a summary of the vaccines these studies cover * 1 relating to MMR ( not a vaccine ICAN asked about ) ; * 13 relating to thimerosal ( not an ingredient in any vaccine ICAN * 4 relating to both MMR and thimerosal ; * 1 relating to antigen ( not a vaccine ) exposure ; and Incredibly , the one study relating to DTaP on the CDC \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) , paid for by the CDC , which conducted a comprehensive review looking specifically for studies relating to whether DTaP does or does not cause autism .\nThe IOM concluded that *it could not identify a single study to support that DTaP does not cause autism* .\nInstead , the only relevant study the IOM could identify found an association between DTaP and autism In other words , the only study the CDC listed that actually looked at any of the vaccines given to babies during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are no studies to support that DTaP does not cause autism .\nYet , the CDC chose that study as one of the few that supports its claim that \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism \u201d This reality is truly incredible because , when it comes to autism , vaccines are the one suspected culprit that the CDC claims to have exhaustively investigated but , yet , the CDC could not provide a single study to support its conclusion that the vaccines given during the first six months of life do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those raising concerns about vaccine safety are unscientific and misinformed .\nIt is therefore truly stunning that when we asked the CDC for studies to support its claim that \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism , \u201d the March 2 , 2020 stipulation and order made it abundantly clear that it was the CDC \u2019 s own claim that \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism \u201d that was unscientific And now for the coup de gr\u00e2ce .\nICAN \u2019 s demands at the end of 2019 and over which it took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the studies he CDC \u201c relied upon \u201d to claim that Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism .\nICAN now had a court ordered stipulation that specifically listed the twenty studies the CDC \u201c relied upon \u201d to support this claim\u2013 none of which supported that the vaccines given during the first six months of life do not cause auti To assure that the CDC understood ICAN was never , ever , ever , letting this issue go , on March 6 , 2020 ( days after concluding the federal lawsuit ) ICAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC : \u201c All studies supporting the claim that DTaP does not cause autism \u201d and days later requested \u201c Studies created or retained by CDC to support the claim that DTaP does not cause autism.\n\u201d The difference between this and ICAN \u2019 s prior requests is subtle but powerful .\nInstead of asking for the studies the CDC \u201c relied upon \u201d to support that DTaP does not cause autism ( as it did previously ) , ICAN was now seeking the studies that in fact support that DTaP does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the CDC could not list its MMR or thimerosal studies \u2013 its hands were tied .\nIt understood there was nowhere left to hide its unsupported claim that \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism.\n\u201d And it knew that ICAN would again take it to court , and this time the outcome could be even harsher On the heels of the foregoing , and dozens of related demands regarding autism that ICAN continued to press , in the dead of the night , and without any fanfare or announcement , on August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed the claim that \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism \u201d from its website !\nThe CDC had finally capitulated to the trut Compare for yourself the CDC \u2019 s autism-vaccine webpage on August 26 , 2020 versus August 27 , 202 You may be wondering why we waited until now to announce this amazing news .\nWell , ICAN and its legal team have been so busy fighting on dozens of vaccine related fronts ( mandatory MMR vaccines , flu shot requirements , improper COVID vaccine trials , etc . )\nthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine-autism claim had been removed when we recently turned back to that front !\nLike a Mayan temple hidden in plain sight for hundreds of years , ICAN only recently discovered the CDC \u2019 s silent capitulation .\nThe most recent data from CDC shows that 1 in 36 children born this year in the United States will develop autism .\nThis is a true epidemic .\nIf the CDC had spent the same resources studying vaccines and autism as it did waging a media campaign against parents that claim vaccines caused their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a better place for everyon To their credit , parents with autistic children have never backed down .\nIn the face of incessant brow beatings by public health authorities , studies have found between 40 % and 70 % of parents with an autistic child continue to blame vaccines for their child \u2019 s autism , typically pointing to vaccines given during the first six months of life .\nThese parents know what they experienced , what their parental instincts tell them , and no amount of shaming can change that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism , \u201d it is ICAN \u2019 s sincere hope that our public health authorities have turned or will soon be turning the corner on this issue .\nThat they will fund independent scientists to conduct the desperately needed studies of autism and the cumulative impact of the vaccines given during the first The cries of parents who know that vaccines caused their child \u2019 s autism should no longer be ignored .\nThe science must be done .\nAnd ICAN will continue to fight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The CDC \u2019 s website does continue to claim that \u201c Vaccine ingredients do not cause autism \u201d and so ICAN \u2019 s fight continues !\nOur next step will be to force the CDC to admit whether or not they are also making this claim for aluminum adjuvants used in vaccines .\nAnd if so , to produce the studies to support this claim .\n( See ICAN \u2019 s white paper on aluminum adjuvants and autism here .\nOf course , whether one or more ingredients , like water used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really the issue .\nThe question is whether the vaccine , the product itself as formulated , causes autism .\nAnd we now know that the CDC finally understands that it can no longer claim that \u201c Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism.\n\u201d This is the greatest defeat that The Hungry Lie has suffered yet , and the global community owes ICAN a debt of gratitude for their work greater than they will ever receive .\nRemaining on the CDC 's web site are other numerous false claims , that are yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must go is the lie that , \u201c There is no link between vaccines and autism.\n\u201d This is not just untrue merely at this point in time , or a any time in the 21st century , it has never been true .\nThe scientific record linking vaccine and autism began with the scientific record on autism itself , and extends through a growing body of research today .\nIt began when Kanner took notes interviewing Richard M 's mother , and she reported his vaccine reaction and subsequent regression into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called \u201c Autism \u201d by Kanner when he published the first paper on the disorder .\nVaccine induced autism was reported before the word \u201c autism \u201d even existed .\nIn 2007 I grew tired of hearing that \u201c there is no link between vaccines and autism , \u201d and began keeping a list of research that linked vaccines and autism online .\nThe list has now grown to more than 150 papers supporting the link , and is unfortunately woefully behind , as the project has no funding , and little time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development .\nKanner 's report of Richard M 's post-vaccine regression in 1943 is the last study on the list .\nThe list , in whole or in part , has been called to the attention to countless numbers of state and federal health officials , but to my knowledge , no agency has ever undertaken a review of the research , in whole or in part , and applied the research to the assertion that \u201c there is no link between vaccines and autism.\n\u201d This despite the fact that the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC itself , run by the head of the CDC 's Vaccine Safety Branch , Frank DeStefano , and found a 600 % increase in autism in children who received the highest levels of mercury in their vaccines .\nIt can be plainly stated that the US National Immunization Program ( now called the National Vaccine Plan ) run by the US Department of Health and Human services , is the most nakedly corrupt sector of the US Government .\nEvery living American and most of the global population is impacted by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety statement offered by any local , state , or federal authority remains untouched by this fraud , and no statement offered on vaccine safety by any of them should be believed and taken at face value .", "author":

"source": "ageofautism", "title": "Did CDC Intentionally Under-Report Allergic Reactions?", "content": "Excerpted from Children 's Health Defense 's The Defender with permission : By John Stone and Dr. Meryl Nass , MD On Jan. 13 , California health officials issued a hold on 330,000 doses of Moderna \u2019 s COVID-19 vaccine after \u201c fewer than 10 \u201d people at San Diego \u2019 s Petco Park stadium vaccine clinic suffered allergic reactions to the vaccine .\nSanta Clara County officials lifted the hold on the vaccine lot in question on Jan. 21 .\nOne day later , on Jan. 22 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d report on Moderna \u2019 s COVID-19 vaccine .\nFor the report , the CDC used data reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) between Dec. 21 , 2020 \u2013 Jan. 10 , 2021 to investigate cases of anaphylaxis , a life-threatening allergic reaction , following injections of Moderna \u2019 s vaccine .\nThe CDC \u2019 s choice to use VAERS data to calculate the rate of anaphylaxis associated with Moderna \u2019 s vaccine is idiosyncratic and troubling .\nWhy ?\nFirst , VAERS is a \u201c passive \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high degree of underreporting .\nIn fact , a 2010 study ( Lazarus et al , 2010 ) commissioned by the CDC , concluded that \u201c fewer than 1 % of vaccine injuries \u201d are reported to VAERS .\nA 2015 study ( Shimabukuro et al , 2015 ) similarly concluded that vaccine adverse events are underreported .\nThe other problem with VAERS ?\nReports often get filed only weeks or months after the event , which means the data is not current .\nThere are other reporting systems that the CDC could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moderna \u2019 s vaccine .\nFor example , the Vaccine Safety Datalink ( VSD ) data , which the CDC used to calculate its overall rate of 1.3 events per million doses , updates in real time .\nSo does the V-safe database , which was created specifically to assess the safety of COVID-19 vaccines .\nV-safe sends text message prompts to vaccine recipients on a daily basis for a week after a person is vaccinated , and occasionally thereafter .\nThe prompts urge vaccine recipients to report any side effects directly using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public of six cases of anaphylaxis following Pfizer \u2019 s COVID vaccine during the first week of the vaccination program .\nIts information came from the V-safe active surveillance data .\nBoth the Vaccine Safety Datalink and V-safe are considered \u201c active \u201d surveillance systems , sensitive for identifying events and fit for calculating event rates in a vaccinated population .\nHowever , unlike VAERS , neither systems \u2019 contents are available for public scrutiny .\nCDC \u2019 s Jan. 22 report on the Moderna reactions surprisingly asserted that \u201c reporting efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , \u201d and \u201c VAERS is likely sensitive at capturing anaphylaxis cases occurring after COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\u201d Read more at The Defender .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

has been harmed \u2013 either emotionally or physically \u2013 at the hands of another .\nWhen it \u2019 s an adult who \u2019 s belittled , abused , or caused serious injury to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood boils .\nAnd when it \u2019 s my child who \u2019 s been mistreated , you better believe I \u2019 ll make some noise about it .\nOver the years , I \u2019 ve heard wonderful stories from other parents about their child \u2019 s caregivers .\nI learn that these other humans are kind , compassionate , and able to get the child to do things no one else thought possible .\nI love to hear about those victories and those kinds of stories .\nUnfortunately , other caregiver stories with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by parents , too .\nThose jaw-dropping accounts are shocking .\nThey are few and far between , thankfully , but even so , they can quickly suck the wind right out of me when I hear them .\nParents of nonverbal children already feel much of the weight of the world on their shoulders .\nIt brings parents immediately to their knees when they learn that adults they implicitly trusted have done something horrible to their child .\nIt 's hard to get back up , But if we do n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing her name made me angry all over again .\nAfter firing her , we learned that she had been taken off other clients ' programs .\nWe also learned that she may have physically hurt our son .\nWe had no proof though , and I was not about to invite her back into our home to ask her about it .\nI decided to go through some old files during a recent snowstorm .\nI still have several binders from several of Ronan 's academic and behavior programs , to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early intervention days .\nOver the years , I 'll read through the important files and letters we 've received and decide if I need to keep them or toss them .\nLast weekend , I wanted to toss everything .\nThat 's when I came across the name of the young woman I wrote about in this post , back in June of 2017 .\nIt recently came to my attention that an individual who \u2019 d been working with my child needed to go .\nOn paper , they were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a different story .\nRonan got hurt .\nIt wasn \u2019 t physical , thank God , but damage was done .\nThat hasn \u2019 t happened often , but when it has , it \u2019 s made it very hard for me to trust people again .\nI will sometimes say , if Ronan \u2019 s happy then I \u2019 m happy .\nLately , Ronan had become increasingly unhappy , especially - and only \u2013 after some therapy .\nHe wasn \u2019 t the only one who \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d been getting a gut feeling that something was off .\nWhen I would drive away after Ronan \u2019 s session had started , the pit-in-my-stomach feeling lingered .\nI knew something had to give .\nChanges had been made , but Ronan \u2019 s needs continued to be overlooked and he was starting to get increasingly upset .\nI \u2019 ve promised to care for my children , to love them , to teach them , and to protect them .\nProtecting them , especially Ronan , has the biggest challenge .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ears .\nI am his voice .\nHe couldn \u2019 t tell me , \u2018 Mom , something \u2019 s not right .\nCan you please make it better ?\n\u2019 , but his behavior sure did .\nRonan took out his frustrations , and no doubt , lost a little faith in me after his desperate attempts to communicate his dismay during therapy sessions .\nBy the time I was clued in , it was too late .\nThe situation was beyond repair .\nA program we \u2019 d worked hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone I \u2019 d trusted .\nHaving to address that problem and the person who \u2019 d caused the issue made me livid .\nWhile this person gets to quietly exit our lives , I was forced to deal with the fallout .\nHolding onto hope that we can move past the interruption and the pain , the burden I carry feels a tad heavier now .\nIt \u2019 s a terrible weight to bear , but if not me , then whom ?\nCertainly not Ronan !\nHe \u2019 s dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs as great as they are , though , I do still have to rely on others for assistance .\nTheir experiences , their referrals , and their qualifications are necessary .\nThey can easily make the process smoother .\nBut if they don \u2019 t truly want to help , or if they are only here for their gain , their assistance will be a detriment instead of a benefit .\nI am rendered speechless when I \u2019 m forced to deal with the ineptitude of an adult .\nWhen that adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect , credentialed professional but who can \u2019 t see the amazing and incredible fragile human being placed in their care , I am reduced to a puddle on the floor .\nEventually , I pick myself up and begin to move forward .\nI have to .\nAs much as I \u2019 d like to do everything on my own , I know that I can not .\nWhen I next reach outside of my circle for help , I hope that the person I \u2019 ve asked to assist us is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist .\nThat person may come in the form of a therapist , a doctor , a nurse , or an administrator .\nSome truly are willing participants and play their role very well .\nOthers not so much .\nWhen those bad apples come around , as we recently experienced , one may begin to understand why parents like me have become somewhat jaded .\nWe trusted professionals .\nWe depended on them completely .\nWe believed in them wholeheartedly .\nSome professions are amazing , and we want to replicate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut the bad ones really do ruin it for everyone else .\nI pray that we can replace the individual we let go with someone who will be able to look past Ronan \u2019 s disability and see the amazing child that he is .\nI \u2019 m sure we will find an adequate replacement , but no matter who steps into that role my guard is already up .\nWho could blame me ?\nRecovering from disappointment isn \u2019 t easy .\nNor is trusting strangers .\nOftentimes , we hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village to raise a child or to train a child.\n\u201d Some people , due to their unique circumstances , must rely on others to help them raise their child .\nThey readily welcome the village and those within it .\nThat concept works for them .\nIt could work for others , too .\nIt can , as long as it \u2019 s not the village idiot who \u2019 s been hired or assigned to take care of your

\u2013 Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Re : Urgent warning re Covid-19 vaccine-related deaths in the elderly and Care Homes In our Open Letter of 23 November 2020 , addressed to the MHRA , JCVI and Matt Hancocki , we outlined our concerns of potential public health risks from a mass roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccines because of only limited short-term safety data and no long-term safety data .\nIn this letter we draw to your attention the mounting evidence that the public health risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now call for an immediate and urgent audit of deaths that have occurred since the beginning of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout , to ascertain if Covid-19 vaccines ( in general or any one brand in particular ) are leading to an increased number of deaths ( Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 related ) , Covid-19 cases or increased risk of death in certain age groups or cohorts .\nAmong our concerns in our previous Open Letter , we raised the potential issues of : \u2022 Antibody Dependent Enhancement ( ADE ) induced by the vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitalisations and deaths in the weeks or months after vaccinations .\n\u2022 The lack of safety data on elderly people with multiple comorbidities .\nThis cohort was under represented and a statistically insignificant group in the clinical vaccine trials .\nWe postulated that there may be increased vaccine side-effects in this group , which would only become apparent when many thousands of them had received vaccinations .\n\u2022 The absence of any safety data regarding those who have already had Covid-19 , and the possibility that prior immunity may lead to increased side-effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern is the impact of Covid-19 vaccines on the very elderly and those in care homes .\nONS data shows that weekly care home deaths tripled in the two weeks between 8th and 22nd January 2021ii , at a time when there was a massive increase in the rate of vaccinations of care home residents iii ( Fig 1 and Fig 2 )

of vaccines to mitigate the spread of the disease .\nDuring the 2009 H1N1 outbreak , one specific vaccine used in the UK and Northern Europe caused an increase in narcolepsy , which resulted in substantial compensation claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations , the global pharmaceutical-industry lobbying group , publicly demanded that manufacturers be granted liability protection from vaccine-related adverse events if they were going to participate in pandemic response initiatives .\n[ 5 ] Creating a compensation program is not a new process for the WHO or United Nations .\nAfter the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait , the United Nations created the UN Compensation Commission in 1991 , evaluating nearly 2.7 million claims and issuing 1.5 million awards , totaling over $ 50 billion dollars .\n[ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is promoting this compensation program as the world \u2019 s first global program to provide for those who have suffered allegedly rare , serious adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccines .\nIn the COVAX announcement , it appears that the cutoff date , or statute of limitations to file a petition , is June 30 , 2022 .\nGavi , created in 2000 with start-up funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , is an international organization -- a global Vaccine Alliance , bringing together public and private sectors with the shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and underused vaccines for children living in the world 's poorest countries .\n[ 3 ] The COVAX Facility is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) , Gavi and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the United Nations and alongside key delivery partner UNICEF .\nIts aim is to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines , and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world .\n[ 2 ] On Monday , Feb 22 , 2021 , The World Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury compensation program for COVID-19 vaccines .\nWHO has designated 92 low- and middle-income countries and economies eligible for support via the GAVI COVAX Advance Market Commitment ( AMC ) of the COVAX Facility .\n[ 1 ] In the US , the White House committed $ 2 Billion for 2021 and another $ 2 billion for 2022 for the purchases and development of COVID vaccines for the COVAX facility .\nThe levy to create the compensation fund will be on vaccines paid for by taxpayers from several nations .\nNo liability for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US law .\nNor do the WHO , GAVI , or the UN expend any resources .\nThis is a global consumer tax to pay for vaccine injuries .\nThe COVAX cutoff date seems arbitrary .\nThey give no reason why .\nBut it does raise some serious questions .\nThe COVID facility released a forecast of vaccination for these 92 nations .\nThe forecast calls to vaccinate one-third of the population of all eligible nations by the end of 2021 .\n[ 7 ] If that holds true , will they be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately 67 % by the end of 2022 ?\nHighly doubtful .\nwhereas on Friday , February 19 , 2021 , leaders of the Group of Seven industrial powers said they would accelerate global vaccine development and deployment and support \u201c affordable and equitable access to vaccines \u201d and treatments for COVID-19 .\nThey cited a collective $ 7.5 billion from the G-7 to U.N.-backed efforts .\n[ 8 ] WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus thanked the G-7 countries for their \u201c significant \u201d pledges .\nBut he said after talks Monday with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have the money , if you can not use the money to buy vaccines \u2026 having the money does not mean anything.\n\u201d [ 9 ] He said some rich countries \u2019 approaches to manufacturers to secure more vaccines are \u201c affecting the deals with COVAX , and even the amount that was allocated for COVAX was reduced because of this.\n\u201d [ 10 ] Will citizens of these low income nations be ineligible for compensation because of the cutoff date ?\nWill this compensation program be transparent with reporting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given that the \u201c gold standard \u201d for this new COVAX Facility , according to three prominent authors , is the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program ( CICP ) of the United States .\nThe authors published their proposal specifically for the WHO in the New England Journal of Medicine December 2020 .\n[ 11 ] The CICP is notorious as a program in which \u201c you can file and lose , \u201d according to attorney Renee Gentry .\n[ 12 ] Robert Krakow , a New York City attorney and former prosecutor who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview , \u201c The most notable feature of The Who announcement about a \u201c no-fault \u201d vaccine injury compensation program for \u201c low and middle income countries \u201d touted as a \u201c fast , fair , robust and transparent process \u201d , it its lack of transparency .\nThe program is presented as a way to \u201c reduce the need for recourse to the law courts , a potentially lengthy and costly process.\n\u201d What the WHO announcement fails to mention is the primary purpose of the program is to pave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulating vaccine manufacturers from liability for serious vaccine injuries - injuries that everyone agrees will inevitably happen .\nThe WHO program is likely modeled after the U.S. PREP Act Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program ( CICP ) , which uses an opaque process that severely limits the access vaccine injury victims have to compensation for serious injuries.\n\u201d [ 13 ] In announcing its vaccine injury compensation program , the WHO also announced its partnership with Chubb , a Swiss insurance company .\nChubb promotes itself as the world \u2019 s largest publicly traded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in over 54 countries worldwide .\nYet another \u201c public-private \u201d partnership , with the clear implication that other insurance companies will also be involved .\nTied with the Chubb announcement , its subsidiary , Inc. signed an agreement to administer the compensation program .\n[ 14 ] ESIS provides claim and risk management services to a wide variety of commercial clients .\n[ 15 ] So will ESIS have the medical expertise to interpret a flood of COVID-related injury claims ?\nIs there a known COVID injury profile ?\nWe probably will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some time , maybe longer , if the promised transparency of the program is opaque .\nIn the US , the CICP already is receiving many petitions for alleged injuries related to COVID vaccines and also from other \u201c countermeasures , \u201d including medical devices and drugs .\nAmong other glaring deficiencies of the CICP system is that the petitioner may not call on medical experts to testify to their injury and the mechanism of harm .\nSince the CICP does not reimburse attorneys and medical experts , very few will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causation .\nWithout experts to help guide petitioners through the administrative process , to evaluate their injury , and to help provide a course of medical treatment for future needs , most petitioners will be lost and completely unable to recover any compensation .\nCOVID vaccines , which many regard to be more aptly described as gene therapies , are completely novel , thus the injuries related to them will likely be unique , hard to prove , and sadly , also hard to treat .\nHow will ESIS handle these COVAX petitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely administrative , with no appeal to a judicial system of any sort .\nThus , it is extremely like the CICP in the United States , which many consider to be unconstitutional .\n[ 16 ] Who will have access to the decisions granting or denying compensation ?\nWe must ask questions about the other nations contributing funds and other resources to the COVAX facility .\nMost do not have compensation programs for injuries from COVID-19 vaccines .\nFor those countries that have already begun vaccination programs , how are they handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationwide in early December 2020 for COVID-19 vaccine injuries but did not release details .\nAnd a few personal injury attorneys have said they are unaware of any details .\nDid Canada make an announcement just too calm legitimate fears without a program in place ?\nThe nations of Singapore , Indonesia , Vietnam , and Nepal have COVID vaccine injury compensation programs .\nSeveral others have announced they will review how their existing medical systems can deliver proper care .\nIs that another way of saying that if you get injured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs , and that is it ?\nNo compensation for any injury ?\nSounds more and more like people are being induced and coerced into playing COVID-19 vaccine roulette .\nThe overall concerning issue is the establishment and implementation of a global compensation program .\nLast fall , I wrote about how The PREP Act took the first step of federalizing vaccination policy by allowing pharmacists to administer the childhood vaccination schedule .\n[ 17 ] Now we have a partial-global compensation program for 92 countries to be run by the WHO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWill countries with existing compensation programs eventually merge with this new compensation program ?\nWill Pharma along with WHO/GAVI/UN/UNICEF apply coercive pressure to nations to join up or wait at the end of the line for vaccines ?\nWill we see in a few years a complete indemnified pharmaceutical industry and countries and their citizens unable to sue for damages ?\nTruly , a global compensation program with a global liability free pharmaceutical industry .\nWayne Rohde is the author of The Vaccine Court-Dark Truth of America \u2019 s Vaccine Injury Compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He

authorization and an official approval by the FDA ?\nThere are a couple of others that are still being tested to determine if they \u2019 re safe and effective , but the three that I just mentioned , have been shown in very large clinical trials involving anywhere from 30,000 to 44,000 people per trial , were shown to be not only very efficacious , but quite safe .\nSo there are three vaccines that have gotten emergency use authorization from the FDA so far .\nAnd the other one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson , which is a little bit different .\nIt gives the same kind of response , but it \u2019 s a little bit different .\nOne from Pfizer , which is another mRNA vaccine .\nFauci : Three of them .\nOne from Moderna , which is the mRNA vaccine .\nSo , first question : which of the COVID 19 vaccines have been officially approved by the FDA ?\nIt would be very helpful for all of us to learn and to understand about the vaccine .\nDerbez : Let \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was telling people I was a little bit concerned , so I had a lot of doubts about this vaccine , and then I got the invitation to talk to you .\nI was left with the overwhelming feeling that the COVID 19 vaccines pose lots of questions with few answers .\nFauci danced around the possibility that these vaccines stop transmission , provide immunity or merely reduce symptoms .\nIf you listen to the end , he seems to say they do all three .\nIf everyone in the family is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can gather \u201c in the home \u201d without masks , hugging and kissing everyone .\nDerbez brought up asymptomatic spread of the virus , along with the effectiveness of the COVID19 vaccines .\nFauci noted that only \u201c some \u201d bishops advised against the Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine because of fetal cell use .\nFauci was equally untroubled when Derbez questioned the controversial use of aborted fetal cell lines in vaccine manufacture .\nDerbez said it was of concern to many Hispanic Catholics .\nFauci had to admit it hadn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t worried because \u201c the results are really , really good.\n\u201d What about the new mRNA vaccines ?\nDerbez wanted to know if this \u201c technology [ has ] ever been injected into humans before.\n\u201d What about the lack of liability on the part of vaccine makers and side effects that don \u2019 t show up 5 to 10 years down the road ?\nDerbez pressed these points repeatedly .\nDerbez wanted to know why we should trust vaccines with only months of trials , not years and only Emergency Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise was that Derbez knew what to bring up about the development and safety of the COVID19 vaccines .\nHe actually asked questions you will never hear from anyone in the mainstream media .\nI have to think that Fauci agreed to this 30 minute talk in order to give himself an opportunity to promote the COVID 19 vaccine to Hispanic Americans .\nAn emergency use authorization is based on the criteria if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk , and that you get a good degree of efficacy and safety .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a longer period of time and you get more information and data .\nI have no doubt , given how very , very efficacious all three of these are , that they will ultimately get the full authorization , in the sense of what \u2019 s called a biological license approval .\nEmergency use authorization is really quite of an important step in the direction of getting it the official approval .\nSo let me give you an example how much confidence I have in the emergency use authorization .\nI myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines , and I recommended strongly to the President and the Vice President that they get vaccinated , and they did get vaccinated with it .\nSo they have a great deal of confidence in the safety and in the efficacy of the vaccine .\nDerbez : If vaccines are safe and effective , why hasn \u2019 t the FDA given any of them the full official approval and license ?\nFauci : That is a very good question .\nThere isn \u2019 t like they have any problem with it , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the approval .\nSo when this is such a good product that you want to get it to people as quickly as possible because it \u2019 s lifesaving , you give it what \u2019 s called an emergency use authorization .\nNot that \u2019 s there \u2019 s anything less effective in it , it just takes a long time to get the full approval , and rather than deprive people of getting a life-saving vaccine before all the I \u2019 s get dotted and the T \u2019 s get crossed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on a lot of solid data that works .\nDerbez : What is the medical and legal responsibility of the companies that are making the vaccines ?\nWhat happens if secondary effects are seen in let \u2019 s say in 5 or 10 years ?\nCan I sue the manufacturer of the product if it hurts me or if there \u2019 s long term effects years down the road ?\nFauci : There is a fund that allows the compensation for injury , but I have tell you , Eugenio , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely that you \u2019 re going to have an effect 5 to 10 years down the pike .\nThe reason we say that is we have decades of experience in the field of vaccinology , and virtually all of the effects\u2014if they even occur , and they \u2019 re very rare\u2014occur within 15 to 45 days following the dose .\nOne of the stipulations of the emergency use authorization , is that they don \u2019 t allow it to be given to people until 60 days following when half of the people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re adding some cushion time .\nSo that \u2019 s the reason why , even though we had the data that indicated that it was safe and effective , each of the companies had to wait 60 days before they were able to release it to be given to the people because most of the bad effects , if they do occur , and I say , it \u2019 s extremely rare , they almost all occur between 15 and 45 days .\nDerbez : I \u2019 m more concerned about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s why I asked about if they can sue the manufacturer because governments around the world are taking liability .\nBut I \u2019 m talking about the manufacturer .\nIf there is a problem , can I sue the people that make the vaccine , not the government , the people who make the vaccine ?\nI heard they are protected from liability .\nIf they \u2019 re not willing to stand for their product , or if I can \u2019 t sue them , does that mean they \u2019 re worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nFauci : They are very sensitive about hurting people , but you can sue anybody you want to sue .\nThere \u2019 s no guarantee because it would be in a court that would decide whether or not you get compensation , but we have not had any issues with that in any of the other vaccines , so I would be really surprised if that the case .\nDerbez : There \u2019 s one thing that I suppose would make people or skeptics like me more confident about vaccines .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protections on vaccine manufacturers .\nI think that the ability to be sued\u2026is what makes companies make a better product .\nIf you take that away , what incentive do they have to fix a problem with their product ?\nDo you know what I mean ?\nIf the manufacturers could be sued for every death and injury that is caused by the vaccination , probably they wouldn \u2019 t put it on the market right now .\nI think they should be responsible for the product they make .\nFauci : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the things you \u2019 ve got to separate is when you get injury in a trial or injury in a product after it has been fully approved .\nYou have the opportunity\u2014I-I-I understand where you \u2019 re coming from and why you bring it up , but you have the opportunity to sue anybody anytime for anything you want to do .\nThat is the truth .\nThey question is , you have to show that it is related to the vaccine itself .\nWe have so few , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a situation where five or ten years later , something related to a vaccine caused someone an injury .\nThat \u2019 s the reason why I say , almost everything that occurs , is within a very short period of time .\nDerbez : But if I sue \u2026it \u2019 s the government , not the company .\nRight ?\nDerbez : I \u2019 ve heard that the reason people should take vaccines is to create herd immunity .\nFauci : The first reason to take the vaccine is to protect yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunity refers to a situation where you have a high percentage of people who are vaccinated so that when the virus enters the community , they are so few people to attack that the virus has a difficulty in propagating itself .\n\u2026Herd immunity means you get an umbrella of protection because so many people are protected that when the virus comes in , it spreads only when there are a lot of vulnerable people .\nIf a certain percentage of the people are protected , like with measles , if you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measles\u201491 , 92 percent\u2014when you get measles introduced into the community , it will not spread .\nBut if you get down to levels into the 80s , there \u2019 s enough vulnerable people that the virus can spread .\nThey use the word herd .\nYou know what it refers to ?\nYou ever see when you look at the movie pictures of Africa where you see the herds of wildebeests and the lions are trying to get to them ?\nAnd you have all of the adult wildebeests around , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the babies , they \u2019 re in there , but there are few of them .\nThe herd protects the vulnerable because in this case the lion or whatever the animal is that is the prey animal that \u2019 s trying to prey on them can \u2019 t get to the vulnerable ones because there are too many people that are protected .\nThat \u2019 s why they use the word herd immunity .\nDerbez : If herd immunity is of paramount importance , what can be done with all the undocumented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vaccine out of fear of deportation ?\nThe Department of Homeland Security has made it very clear that there will be nothing punitive associated with getting vaccinated , so undocumented immigrants who get vaccinated , will not be pursued for the fact that they are undocumented .\nThat has been a promise from the Department of Homeland Security .\nFauci : We heard that from them in the previous administration and in the current administration .\nThat is a promise .\nFor people to get vaccinated who are undocumented , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derbez : I have friends that consider themselves very healthy .\nThey say they don \u2019 t need the vaccine .\nBut I \u2019 ve heard that even if healthy people have a very low risk of dying from COVID , they should still get the vaccine so they don \u2019 t spread the virus to people who might be too old or too sick to get the vaccine .\nIs that true ?\nAn example : If you \u2019 re a young , healthy person , statistically the chances are if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get seriously ill .\nThe people who get seriously ill and die\u2014and I must point out as I think you know , already there have been 525,000 deaths in this country , which is absolutely terrible , the worst of any pandemic in over a hundred years .\nBut when a young person gets vaccinated , not only do they protect themselves , of course even though it \u2019 s rare , there are still a lot of young people who get seriously ill , not nearly as many as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if a young person has an underlying condition like diabetes or obesity or hypertension , they will be at high risk to get serious consequences .\nBut when you get vaccinated , not only do you protect yourself , but you prevent yourself from inadvertently , maybe innocently and unknowingly infecting someone who is a loved one , a family member or maybe just someone in society , who if they did get infected , they would have a serious consequence .\nSo you have a personal responsibility and a societal responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derbez : The news has reported that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are 95 percent effective .\nDoes this mean that if I get the vaccine , I won \u2019 t get infected with the SARS\u2014CoV2 virus ?\nFauci : That means that there is a 95 percent chance that you will not get symptomatic infection , mainly that you won \u2019 t get infected to the point that you get symptoms .\nWe are unsure right now what the protection is against infection because it \u2019 s conceivable that you could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not know it because the vaccine is protecting you against symptoms\u2014that you could have virus in your nasopharynx , which is the reason why we say until we prove that the vaccine prevents transmission , that people who are vaccinated , should wear a mask when they \u2019 re near people who might be vulnerable to infection .\nDerbez : I think it \u2019 s a different thing to stop the clinical disease or the symptoms ; it \u2019 s different from getting the virus , the infection .\nSo basically the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not prevent me from being infected with SARS-CoV2 , which means there \u2019 s the possibility that I can still spread the virus even after I receive the vaccine .\nFauci : That \u2019 s the reason why we ask you to wear a mask after you \u2019 ve been vaccinated , but the evidence is accumulating that the level of virus in the nasopharynx is very low , and it is unlikely that you would transmit it .\nBut just to be sure , we \u2019 re saying wear a mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will get enough data to be able to prove whether or not , if you get infected despite the fact that you \u2019 re vaccinated , proving that in fact that it is a very , very low risk that you would transmit it to someone else .\nDerbez : I \u2019 ve been reading and I saw that you stop getting the symptoms but you still can get infected , and you can still spread it .\nDerbez : So [ what is ] the aim of the vaccine , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus or transmitting it ?\nFauci : The main purpose of the vaccine is to prevent you from getting sick , going to the hospital and maybe dying .\nThat \u2019 s the main purpose of the vaccine .\nThe main purpose of the vaccine in general is to prevent you from getting clinical illness .\nWe believe that when all the data come in , we will prove that it also prevents you from transmitting the infection to other people .\nDerbez : But not yet , right ?\n\u2026 How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we still need to wear masks after being vaccinated ?\nUnder these circumstances , when are we going to get back to normal ?\nAre we going to stop using the masks someday ?\nLet me tell you what you can do right now .\nIf you are vaccinated and you are with a person who is also vaccinated in the setting of the home , if you \u2019 re with your mother , your daughter , your wife , your friend , if you \u2019 re with people who are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , you don \u2019 t need to wear a mask , and you can have physical contact .\nYou can hug your children , you can hug your mother or your father .\nYou can do that if everyone is vaccinated , even if some are not vaccinated as long as they are not at risk for serious disease .\nLet me give you an example .\nSuppose a grandmother is vaccinated .\nShe wants to go a few houses down the block to see her daughter and her granddaughter .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinated , the grandmother can still go in there so long as the daughter and the granddaughter don \u2019 t have an underlying condition that make them susceptible to a severe case of COVID19 .\nIf they \u2019 re normal and healthy , the vaccinated grandmother can go visit the daughter and the granddaughter , take the mask off , give them a big hug and give them a kiss .\nYou can do that .\nDerbez : I \u2019 m confused about something .\nI thought herd immunity works because by being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading to other people .\nBut these vaccines may not do that .\nSo how does herd immunity work if I can still spread the virus even after getting the vaccine .\nFauci : The fact is the vaccine protects many , many , many from getting infected .\nSome pe0ple might get infected and they might even transmit it .\nWe know that some people get infected .\nWe know that , but not everybody who gets the vaccine is going to get infected without symptoms .\nSo the overwhelming majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only will not get sick , they won \u2019 t get infected , but there will be some who might be infected .\nAnd when they are infected , it is unlikely they will transmit it .\nDerbez : So there is a possibility that the vaccine can turn people into what is called asymptotic carriers ?\nWhich means they don \u2019 t have symptom ms , but they \u2019 re still contagious , correct ?\nFauci : Yes , we \u2019 ve said that .\nIt \u2019 s true , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that it is likely that those people have a very small chance of transmitting it .\nWe won \u2019 t know exactly how much until we follow these people for a considerable period of time .\nDerbez : Moderna and Pfizer are both mRNA vaccines .\nHas this kind of mRNA vaccine technology ever been injected into humans before ?\nFauci : This is the first time , and the good news is that the results are really , really good .\nDerbez : In essence , this is an experimental technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a new technology , and it is proven in a very large group of clinical trials to be safe and highly effective .\nDerbez : Are you completely positive that this new technology is safe ?\nHow can we be sure there won \u2019 t be long term effects when these vaccines were seemingly developed so quickly and have only been tested for months and not years .\nFauci : The speed with which it \u2019 s been done is a reflection of the extraordinary advances in science , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said before , in the history of vaccinology , you don \u2019 t see effects that occur years later .\nAlmost all of the bad effects\u2014as rare as they are , and they are very rare\u2014occur between 15 and 45 days from the time you get vaccinated .\nAs I said , because of that , just to be sure , the vaccine is not allowed to be distributed until 60 days after the people have been vaccinated .\nDerbez : The Johnson and Johnson vaccine is not an mRNA vaccine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ?\nFauci : It \u2019 s a vaccine that uses a harmless common cold virus in which you insert the gene of the protein that you want the body to make an immune response against .\nYou inject it , the body sees the protein , makes an immune response and then protects you against infection .\nDerbez : And this is the first time this has been injected into humans too ?\nFauci : No , no , no .\nThey have a lot of experience with EBOLA in Africa with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latinos in the community that are practicing Catholics .\nLast week Catholic bishops warned the Catholic community that they should not use the Johnson and Johnson vaccine .\nCan you explain why ?\nFauci : Some , some , not all , because there are Catholic bishops who are saying the oppose of that .\nAnd the reason is that in the preparation of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine they use the cell line that was taken from fetal tissue from years and years ago to be able to produce the vaccine .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was used , that we should not use the vaccine Derbez : Is that true that there is residual DNA from an aborted baby in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine ?\nFauci : No , there \u2019 s no residual DNA that gets injected into you at all .\nIt \u2019 s in the preparation of the vaccine .\nThere is no residual human fetal DNA at all .\nDerbez : Kids , I \u2019 m concerned about my daughter .\nI have a six year old daughter , and I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extremely low .\nDo they really need the vaccine ?\nAre going to [ vaccinate ] kids in the future ?\nIs it going to be mandatory ?\nFauci : In order to be able to completely crush this outbreak , you want to get as many people , including children , vaccinated as you possibly can , because when you do you will get such a broad protection that you could eliminate this virus .\nAnd that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re trying to do .\nAlso , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some children do get very seriously ill when they get infected .\nAnd that \u2019 s the reason you want to vaccinate them , not only to protect them , but they can be the vehicles of spread of the virus to other people .\nDerbez : Is it going to be mandatory at school , because my daughter , when I enrolled her into school , it was mandatory to have all the vaccines .\nCOVID didn \u2019 t exist back then .\nIs it going to be mandatory at school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I can \u2019 t say that it is or won \u2019 t .\nIt \u2019 s is certainly conceivable that it might ultimately turn out to be mandatory , but right now , nothing that we \u2019 re talking about is mandatory .\nIn the future , it could be , similar to the mumps , measles , rubella and the hepatitis and the meningitis-all of which are required if you go into a public school .\nRight now there is no mandatory anything about it , but someday it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and counting , how effective are each of the approved vaccines ?\nIf I get the vaccine , but it doesn \u2019 t protect me against a new variant .\nFauci : You \u2019 re asking about the variants .\nThe most prevalent variant in the United States is the one from the UK called the 117 .\nThe vaccines that are available right now are highly effective against that particular variant .\nIt \u2019 s less effective against the South African variant , but that is not a prevalent variant in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is the one from the UK .\nDerbez : What if I get the vaccine , but it doesn \u2019 t protect me against the new variant ?\nPharmaceutical [ companies ] are working on a third booster shot .\nIs that true ?\nFauci : Yes , but let me explain what happened in the trial in South Africa with the J and J vaccine .\nIt didn \u2019 t completely protect against getting infected or getting symptoms , but it totally protected you against getting into the hospital and dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variant , you may not be completely protected , but it is very , very good protecting you against getting seriously ill. Derbez : And this third booster shot that they \u2019 re working on , that says to me that probably they \u2019 re not confident that the two shots are going to be good enough .\nDoes that mean that the vaccine doesn \u2019 t work against variants ?\nFauci : No , they \u2019 re not saying that .\nThey want to be doubly sure .\nIn case they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to determine what the effect of that booster is .\nSo in order to be doubly sure , we \u2019 re proceeding with studies to see what happens when you give a third shot .\nThat has nothing to do with being confident or not confident .\nIt means you want to be doubly sure that you \u2019 re covering all the bases .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

Berenson with Martha MacCallum", "content": "You \u2019 re coming across these days sounding sort of like an anti\u2014vaxxer .\nMacCallum : I \u2019 m going to totally switch gears on you .\n\u2026 Before I let you go , I want to spend the second bit of this talking about your approach to vaccines because I \u2019 ve followed your coverage , and we \u2019 ve talked a lot on this show over the course of COVID .\nYou \u2019 ve busted a lot of myths in your writing about COVID .\nHi Alex .\nHow are you doing today ?\nWe want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to start today by asking him about his new book because I always knew Alex as a former New York Times reporter .\nHe \u2019 s also a prolific novelist , who \u2019 s written a new book called the Power Couple .\nMartha MacCallum : Welcome everybody to this edition of the Untold Story .\nWe \u2019 re joined today by a frequent guest and friend of ours , Alex Berenson , who has covered in a really in-depth way the reality of COVID19 and the vaccine structure and the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed message , his points are valid .\nBerenson \u2019 s arguments should be a part of every discussion where people talk about mandating this vaccine for employment or school attendance .\nThis was after pointing out that it hasn \u2019 t been tested in her age group and that if it were up to him , \u201c these vaccines would not be available right now.\n\u201d He did however advise his elderly mother to take the vaccine because at her age , she \u2019 s more vulnerable to COVID .\nAfter raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these vaccines actually do to prevent COVID , he did tell us that he \u2019 s not sure about getting it himself , although his children definitely are not going to get it .\nHe furthermore claimed that along with the risks , there is no proof these vaccines provide immunity or prevent spread .\nSecondly , they haven \u2019 t been tested in the people most at risk from COVID19 : those people who are older with preexisting conditions .\nBerenson said that there have been \u201c thousands and thousands \u201d of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vaccine First of all , the mRNA COVID vaccines are a new , insufficiently tested technology .\nBerenson told listeners something that I \u2019 ve never heard anyone in the news , namely that these vaccines \u201c cause pretty severe events in a lot of people who take them \u201d in the trial phase .\nThis is what they \u2019 re not telling us in the mainstream media : When Berenson got into his reasons for being unconvinced that the COVID19 vaccines are worthwhile , it was clear people should be worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted that he \u2019 s not anti-vaccine .\nHe \u2019 s vaccinated and his children are vaccinated according to the CDC schedule .\nSeveral things were happening here .\nMacCallum brought up the possibility that Berenson is an \u201c anti-vaxxer \u201d right at the start , and he had to defend himself against that charge .\nBerenson had some really eye-opening information that made me wish he was interviewing Dr. Anthony Fauci on these same points .\nBerenson : No , I \u2019 m not an anti-vaxxer .\nI \u2019 ve been vaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you need to look at the COVID vaccines differently than other vaccines because they are different than other vaccines .\nThey aren \u2019 t based on technology that \u2019 s been around for generations .\nThey haven \u2019 t been around for generations .\nThey are a completely new kind of vaccine , based on technology that really was what people in biotechnology call the \u201c bleeding edge of development \u201d in the last few years .\nMeaning you were bleeding a lot of money and a lot of scientific effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they really weren \u2019 t moving forward very quickly and there was a good reason for that .\nThere \u2019 s questions about the technology I don \u2019 t really want to go into right now .\nIt really to explore it takes a long time .\nThese vaccines didn \u2019 t exist at this time last year , or they \u2019 d barely begun to exist .\nWe are trying to vaccinate everybody in the world with them even though the clinical trial data shows they have been pretty severe adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take them .\nThey cause pretty severe events in a lot of people who take them .\nHere \u2019 s what we know about them : We know that they stop mild or moderate COVID infections in a pretty healthy population .\nThat \u2019 s what the clinical trials proved .\nThey didn \u2019 t prove that these reduce deaths .\nThey didn \u2019 t prove that they reduce serious cases of COVID , although you \u2019 ll hear that they didn \u2019 t actually prove that , they demonstrated some benefit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t prove it .\nMost importantly , they weren \u2019 t tested in the people who are most likely to get sick and die from COVID .\nTens of thousands of people were tested with these vaccines , but only a handful\u2014I mean in the hundreds\u2014are in the group of people that are 75 and older who have preexisting conditions , like kidney disease or diabetes .\nThose are the people we know who get sick and die from COVID much , much more than other people .\nI \u2019 m not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is a real failure of regulation that we didn \u2019 t force the manufacturers to test the vaccines in those people .\nSo what we \u2019 re left with is a lot of guesswork as to whether or not these vaccine will actually do any good on a population wide basis , and against that we have a lot of data showing that they cause adverse events in many people who take them .\nMacCallum : But that \u2019 s not what we \u2019 re hearing .\nWe \u2019 re hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re someone who is prone to an allergic reaction to a vaccine , that it is very rare for someone to have an adverse effect to this vaccine so far .\nBerenson : That \u2019 s just simply untrue .\nWhat the CDC is doing and what the media unfortunately is helping them do is defining adverse events very , very narrowly .\nAs essentially , I got this and went into shock in 15 to 30 minutes .\nThat \u2019 s rare .\nIt \u2019 s actually not as rare as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rare .\nBut there are many , many , many other adverse events that follow vaccination with these that we know about , that the clinical trials demonstrated .\nThere are fevers , in some cases fevers of 103 and 104 degrees .\nThere is nausea .\nThere is fatigue that puts people out for days .\nThere is diarrhea .\nMacCallum : Here \u2019 s what I \u2019 m hearing in that , just to push back on that .\nA lot of times when you get a vaccine , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of the disease itself , right ?\nSo you sometimes get those symptoms .\nI \u2019 ve had that happen with the flu vaccine .\nI had a shingles vaccine , my arm blew up for four days afterwards .\nIt \u2019 s that just sort of what happens when you inject a bit of any one of these diseases into your body ?\nBerenson : So now we go to what the vaccine actually is , and that \u2019 s not what these mRNA vaccine are at all .\nWhat you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of genetic material that stimulates your body to produce a part of the corona virus protein .\nThat , in and of itself makes the corona virus vaccine different than the kind of vaccines you \u2019 re talking about .\nOn top of that , because your body \u2019 s going to attack that little piece of RNA , it has to be protected by something called a lipid nanoparticle , and those can also cause adverse events .\nThey can cause your immune system to respond .\nThe science on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when people say , \u201c Oh I like the fact I had this negative reaction after I had that vaccine because it shows my immune system is working , \u201d that \u2019 s actually not really true at all .\nI don \u2019 t like it when people say it because a lot people who are saying it know it \u2019 s not really true at all .\nHere \u2019 s the thing .\nWhen we look at the vaccine adverse events reports that have been filed with the federal government , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this COVID19 vaccine .\nIt \u2019 s possibly in some cases they \u2019 re not directly related .\nThey \u2019 re just something that followed the injection and the injection didn \u2019 t cause .\nBut what we know is that they \u2019 re being filed at much , much higher rates than other vaccines .\nThese vaccines are more toxic to people than the flu vaccine and many other vaccines , and the clinical trial data demonstrates that beyond a doubt .\nAll I \u2019 m saying is , since we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should be demanding proof of efficacy , not just that it reduces mild disease in healthy people , but that we see real evidence that in the people who die from COVID , this prevents COVID deaths .\nThere would be a way to demonstrate that if the companies had run the trials properly .\nThey didn \u2019 t do that , so we \u2019 re guessing .\nI don \u2019 t think that makes me an anti-vaxxer to say this .\nMacCallum : So the J and J vaccine is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more traditional style vaccine where they basically cook the virus , and they make it in order to create this vaccine .\nDo you think that one is safer ?\nBerenson : We haven \u2019 t seen the side effect data on the J and J.\nIt \u2019 s probably somewhat safer than the mRNA vaccines because it doesn \u2019 t have the lipid nanoparticle issue , but we also , it also looks less effective based on the data\u2014 Here \u2019 s ultimate problem with this : There \u2019 s something called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s when you put out a press release that looks really great and then a month later , after everyone has sort of agreed how great this is , you release the full data set , and it looks entirely different .\nThe only people who read that are only a few scientists and a few journalists .\nWe don \u2019 t know what the J and J data says because J and J hasn \u2019 t put it out yet .\nMacCallum : So for yourself and your family members , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think people are just better off taking their chances with COVID19 than getting the vaccine ?\nBerenson : It depends very substantially on age because COVID \u2019 s risks are so stratified by age .\nMy mother asked me , \u201c Should I get the vaccine ?\n\u201d I said , \u201c Yes , get the vaccine .\nYou \u2019 re 76 years old.\n\u201d \u2026 For me , I \u2019 m 48 and I \u2019 m in reasonably healthy condition .\nI \u2019 m not interested in the mRNA vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my children , and again my children to the normal vaccine schedule to this point , they are not getting this vaccine .\nWe will pull them out of school , and my wife agrees with me about this , we will pull them out of school before we give them this vaccine .\nThey are at zero risk basically from COVID , and they should not be subjected to any risk from a vaccine .\nMacCallum : Last question\u2026 We talked a lot about Operation Warp Speed and the pipeline and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just separate from what you think about the vaccine , just from a logistic standpoint , very impressive .\nBut then it just sort of stopped at the state door and left the rest up to them .\nWhat do you think about that failure so far ?\nBerenson : To me it \u2019 s sort of irrelevant .\nI don \u2019 t think we should be pushing the vaccine on people .\nI think we should prioritize the vaccine for people 60 and over , certainly 70 and over .\nSome states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That should have clearly been the national priority , rather than trying to get health care workers\u2014a lot of them don \u2019 t even want to take the vaccine\u2014to take it .\nI think that \u2019 s what we should have done , but honestly if it were up to me , these vaccines would not be available right now .\nThey \u2019 d still be in clinical trial and we \u2019 d be getting the data that we need to show that they actually work and by work I mean reduce deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistically significant\u2014 MacCallum : Do you see evidence that that is beginning to happen ?\nWe \u2019 ve talked about the studies in California and New York that show that show many more people had COVID19 than is publically acknowledged .\nDo you think , completely separate from the vaccine , how much longer do you think COVID19 will be with us without it ?\nBerenson : I don \u2019 t know .\nIn the US right now we \u2019 re going way down .\nWe \u2019 ve hit the peak of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past it .\nIt was in the beginning of January .\nYou don \u2019 t hear this very much but cases are down something like 60 percent from the peak a month ago .\nHospitalizations are now down 35 percent , and they \u2019 re going down every day .\nIt certainly looks like we \u2019 re well passed the third wave .\nWill there be a fourth wave ?\nI \u2019 d like to think not , but at this point COVID \u2019 s made a fool of anybody who \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI \u2019 d say one last thing .\nOne more reason to be concerned about the vaccines on a population wide basis is that Israel , which has done a much aggressive job of vaccinating people over 60 than anywhere else in the world , is in the middle of COVID wave that has not gone down in the last month .\nOurs has gone down .\nWe vaccinated relatively few people .\nTheirs has stayed very high , and they vaccinated a lot of people .\nYou can come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vaccine doesn \u2019 t work .\nYou can explain this is various ways and some of them still are okay for the vaccine , but to me , that \u2019 s a warning flag .\nBut in terms of what we \u2019 re going to see in the U.S. , I \u2019 d like think that what we \u2019 re going to see is that cases continue to go down .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

Last year , one of the top aerosol scientists in Australia , a woman called Lidia Morawska , likened social distancing regulations to a cult ritual .\nSo why is that research still guiding public

.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlson raised concerns about blood clots associated with three of the COVID vaccines .\nHow necessary is it to take the vaccine ?\nHe asked two questions about the vaccines that everyone should be asking and noted that no one has answered them .\nAbout 12 minutes into the show Carlson brought up the push for the COVID19 vaccine .\nWhat is the science out there that supports

German germ research from the 1890s .\n\u201c Wenatchee High School finding a socially distance solution to get the band back together .\nThese so-called pods , set up in the band and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipping themselves in and then removing their masks to play their instruments or to sing.\n\u201d Carlson : Getting less oxygen is good for you , so get inside your little plastic pod like freeze dried people .\nIt \u2019 s dystopia .\n\u2026 The kids had no choice .\nThe science was settled .\nThat \u2019 s what we were told .\nWell it was settled until last Wednesday when the Journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases found the law of six foot social distancing isn \u2019 t actually real .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guess and it \u2019 s wrong .\nResearchers looked at corona virus case rates in the state of Massachusetts , the school districts there , schools that required six foot social distancing and compared those with school districts that required only three feet of social distancing , and there were some .\nResearchers found there was no statistically significant difference in corona virus cases between the two .\nAnd it wasn \u2019 t just for students .\nIt was also true for adult staff members .\nThe study also controlled for corona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not shoddy research .\nIt was real , and here \u2019 s the conclusion : \u201c Lower physical distancing policies can be adopted in school settings with masking mandates without negatively affecting student or staff safety.\n\u201d This has massive implications , but mostly for people like Tony Fauci , people who spent the last year assuring everyone , the science is clear .\nSo if you had spent the last year saying that , insisting that 19th century German hygiene research was the last word on social distancing , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credibility on that fact , wouldn \u2019 t you apologize , now that the fact turns out to be a lie ?\nBut Tony Fauci didn \u2019 t apologize for the fake science he \u2019 s imposed on the entire country .\nHe just nodded and kept going .\n\u2026 \u201c \u2026Does this study suggest to you that three feet is good enough ?\n\u201d Carlson : It does .\nNot a big deal , just kept an entire generation of kids from learning anything .\nWe \u2019 ll just move forward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the clip you just saw is that maybe Tony Fauci is finally learning something about science , because despite what they tell you , science is never final or absolute .\nThere is no settled science .\nThat \u2019 s an oxymoron .\nReal scientists adjust their conclusions based on the evidence which is always changing .\nThey ignore partisan considerations , but Tony Fauci didn \u2019 t .\nIf he had , he \u2019 d already have known this because the study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact back in June of last year one of the leading scientific journals in the world , the Lancet , not a small publication , came out with a study on social distancing , and it found this : \u201c For the general public , [ that would include schools ] evidence shows that physical distancing of more than a meter is highly effective .\nSo three feet was enough in June , they just didn \u2019 t tell us that .\nOther medical experts were saying the same thing .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical director for the Austin Public Health System , put it this way : \u201c I know that at three feet there \u2019 s about an 80 percent reduction of the transmission of the disease.\n\u201d So it \u2019 s not actually new information .\nIt was ignored information , and we made policy on the basis of bad information , not on the basis of science , on the basis of lies justified by 19th century research into tuberculosis .\nSo why are they telling us this now ?\nHere \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country has changed .\nWith Joe Biden in charge , Fauci \u2019 s party wants to see the schools reopen because the public wants it .\nParents are upset , and they should be .\nSo all of a sudden they \u2019 re changing the so-called scientific recommendation .\nIf that seems too cynical to be real , keep in mind they \u2019 ve done it before .\nLast summer dozens of public health experts exempted BLM from corona virus restrictions , not because science demanded that BLM get a pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe so-called scientific community signed a letter that will live forever in infamy claiming , \u201c The risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn \u2019 t keep people from protesting racism.\n\u201d The scourge of white supremacy , the letter said , is a \u201c lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID19.\n\u201d Oh , it contributes to COVID19 .\nSo you thought it may have escaped from a lab in Wuhan that was in part funded by the US government , with the knowledge of Tony Fauci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of China might have something to answer for , but now we learn from the scientific community that your racism caused COVID .\n\u201c In this moment the public health risks of not protesting to demand an end to systemic racism greatly exceed the harms of the virus.\n\u201d It \u2019 s hard to believe that a so-called scientist could write something like that on paper and not be held accountable for it\u2026 .\nThat same month the governor of New Jersey , Phil Murphy , praised the BLM riots that broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Memorial Day .\nYes , there was a mandatory stay-at-home order in New Jersey and a public health emergency , of course , that justified it .\nBut Phil Murphy wasn \u2019 t bothered .\nHe said that rioters were \u201c taking to the streets peacefully to create a better future for our entire New Jersey family.\n\u201d So if they can justify a riot on the basis of public health , \u2026What can \u2019 t they justify ?\nWhat aren \u2019 t they justifying ?\nOur leaders and public health experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , by politics .\n\u2026 And what \u2019 s also becoming clear is how much these experts actually know about some of the topic they claim to be expert in .\n\u2026 It \u2019 s just very hard to know what this virus is going to do .\nViruses are hard to understand .\nThis one is new , but no one will admit it .\nSo out of nowhere news stories pop up that seem to have no explanation .\nEpidemiologists there predicted a surge in corona virus cases this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , South Africa was still not under a strict lockdown , there was a new strain\u2026 There was no vaccine for most people in South Africa .\nIt seemed like the perfect place for what Tony Fauci might call a super spreader event , a disaster .\nBut that \u2019 s not what happened .\nSince mid January , corona virus infections in South Africa have plummeted from more than 20,000 a day to about 1,000 a day .\nLess than 5 percent of corona virus tests administered in South Africa are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why .\nWhat is going on in South Africa ?\nAnd the answer is , we don \u2019 t know .\n\u2026 The problem is when the people in charge of our public health systems won \u2019 t admit that they don \u2019 t know .\nSo all of this should prompt some pretty tough questions for our public health experts in this country .\nAnd one of those questions is : How effective is this corona virus vaccine ?\nHow necessary is it to take the vaccine ?\nDon \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t kick people off social media for asking them .\nAnswer the questions , especially now .\nThe administration would like you to take this vaccine .\nJoe Biden told you last week , if you don \u2019 t , you can \u2019 t celebrate the Fourth of July .\nIt turns out there are things we don \u2019 t know about the effects of this vaccine and all vaccines by the way .\nIt \u2019 s always a tradeoff .\nBut in this specific case , Germany , France , Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just suspended the distribution of Astra Zeneca \u2019 s vaccine .\nThey \u2019 re saying it could be linked to deadly blood clots .\nA month ago the New York Times reported the FDA and the CDC were looking into reports the Moderna and Pfizer \u2019 s vaccine could be causing blood clots as well .\nThe paper reported that one 56 year old physician called Gregory Michael developed a severe case of a blood disorder , platelets in his blood dropped three days after taking the vaccine .\nWithout those platelets his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of a brain hemorrhage after two weeks in the hospital .\nShould this scare you ?\nWe don \u2019 t know , but the rest of us deserve an answer .\nInstead our leaders are acting , once again , as if the science were totally settled , and you \u2019 re not allowed to ask a question .\nLook at the vaccination rates in certain states and it \u2019 s pretty clear some people are not taking the vaccine on purpose .\nIf you want them to take the vaccine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t issue more commands .\nCalm their fear by rationally explaining the benefits and the risks of taking the vaccine .\nThat \u2019 s how you deal with adults .\nBut instead they \u2019 re telling you , if you want to see your grandparents ever again , you \u2019 ll shut up and take the shot .\n\u201c If you and a friend or you and a family member are both vaccinated , you can have dinner together , wearing masks without distancing .\n\u201c You can visit your grandparents if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been too .\n\u201c So instead they just lecture us like they \u2019 re our parents , which they are absolutely not .\n\u2026 As Joe Biden has told us , it \u2019 s possible that you can cook a hot dog in your own backyard in July if you \u2019 re obedient .\nThey tell you this is all about protecting the elderly and flattening the curve\u2026 The question is in real life what happens if you are an older person and you don \u2019 t obey .\nWell we have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman in Galveston , Texas learned on March 11th what happens when you don \u2019 t obey .\nThis was one day after the governor of Texas lifted that state \u2019 s mask mandate and reopened Texas .\nThat woman , apparently believing news reports that it was a free country , walked into a Bank of America branch .\nThat \u2019 s when , to keep her safe , Texas police officers violently attacked her .\n\u2026 So just to be clear , she wasn \u2019 t trying to rob the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teller a note saying she had a bomb or a firearm , she just wasn \u2019 t wearing a mask in a state where there is no mask mandate .\n\u201c Is anyone going to get real here ?\n\u201d she asked , she screamed as she \u2019 s thrown to the ground by the police .\nBut they did it though to keep her safe .\nShe was under the impression she could go into a Bank of America branch in full compliance with state law without being thrown to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut to be fair , if that woman had read more CNN articles she \u2019 d know that actually she had it coming .\n\u2026 According to CNN , facemasks are a sign of respect .\nNo mention of respecting people who don \u2019 t wear facemasks .\nThey \u2019 re not worthy of respect .\nBut wearing a facemask will \u201c help the US return to normal , \u201d because it is totally normal to shield your face from the people around you .\n\u2026 Wearing your mask is a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t do it , you \u2019 ll be beaten in public for your own good .\nAnd as our media will tell you , it \u2019 s not just banks that mandate this new sign of respect .\nOver at NBC News , a similar piece is now advising readers on how they ought to behave at the gym , unless they too want to get thrown to the ground .\n\u201c Instead of taking your mask off to drink from a water bottle , slip the straw under chin of your mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the gym , shower as quickly as possible and only remove your mask when your face and head is going to get wet.\n\u201d So NBC News is now telling you how long you \u2019 re allowed to shower and how you \u2019 re allowed to drink your water with your mask on\u2026 .\nThis is science .\nDon \u2019 t dare question the competence of the people who told you to never wear a mask just a year ago .\nThat would be disrespectful to our public health experts .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show disrespect to public health experts .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

ways .\nWhether I knew you as a professor , a staff member , a coach , a boss , a mentor , or someone who I passed by and had a few conversations with ; you all taught me something .\nAnyone can be a teacher , but it takes a special person to teach something and have that material stick .\nWhat advice/insight do you have for Johnson alumni and current student-athletes interested in your career field ?\nIt is okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field and end up in a career in a different field .\nLook at me , I received my degree in Psychology ; however , I am currently in Education and loving every moment of it .\nIf you want to teach , go for it ; do not let anyone guide you in another direction .\nLooking back on your time as a Johnson student-athlete , what is one of your favorite memories ?\nHonestly , one of my favorite memories as a student-athlete at Johnson was my senior year for rugby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that has never happened before .\nEven though we lost the championship game , that season will go down in history .\nAs a player and a captain , I could not have been prouder of my team .\nAs a student-manager for the Women 's Basketball team , my favorite memory was when we beat Husson at home in the 2016-2017 season .\nStill thinking about that game gives me goosebumps .\nThere was not a single dried eye in the gym .\nHave you attended alumni weekend ?\nIf so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to campus .\nI unfortunately have not been able to attend an alumni weekend at Johnson yet .\nHopefully I will be able to in the future though .\nI have worked many alumni weekend events due to working at CES , but since becoming an alum , I have yet been to one .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

"content": "Other pro-vaccine commenters began to leave similar messages .\nThey were in agreement and clarified that The Unvaccinated should be barred from public schools , from stores , and from society in general .\nParaphrased , an obviously very pro-vaccine individual told another commenter , who happened to have a vaccine-injured child , that Parents like you who choose to not vaccinate should not be allowed to mingle with the public .\nIt isn \u2019 t often that I can \u2019 t come up with a topic to write about for a Sunday \u2019 s post , but this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied me .\nNot wanting to waste any precious time , on Friday morning I cruised through Google news to see if anything there grabbed my attention .\nSomething did .\nBut it wasn \u2019 t the pro-vaccine article that grabbed my eye and got my wheels spinning .\nIt was someone \u2019 s comment that piqued my interest .\nNote : This is a BEST OF Cathy wrote back in 2016 , and relevant in a more shocking way in 2021 .\nBy Cathy Jameson To take unvaccinated children away and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who willingly choose to expose the public to disease .\nBecause it \u2019 s unfair for vaccinated people to be subjected to The Unvaccinated , that \u2019 s why !\nEven though The Unvaccinated can not magically infect other humans no matter how fantastical an idea that is .\nThe belief that The Unvaccinated are icky and selfish and enchanted spreaders of disease is off-base especially when it \u2019 s the vaccinated who are not as immune as they have been lead to believe .\nJust last week , we learned that once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vaccine-preventable disease - this time the mumps , has included individuals who were vaccinated for\u2026wait for it , wait for it\u2026the mumps !\nDespite that undeniable fact , comments toward The Unvaccinated continued to be full of unwarranted accusations .\nIronically , the vaccinated and unvaccinated have been living and breathing alongside each other for quite some time .\nI \u2019 m sure it wasn \u2019 t all peace and harmony in the past when the topic of vaccines was broached , but they \u2019 ve lived side-by-side .\nNot only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people likely had strong opinions about disease and vaccines then as they do now .\nAnd sure , people also more than likely disagreed about those topics then as they do now .\nBut now , with multiple social media platforms and countless online article comment sections open to anyone who has access to the internet , everyone can share their thoughts wherever and whenever they want , nice or otherwise .\nMany do share their thoughts .\nSadly , it isn \u2019 t just a random thought or a strong opinion being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack .\nIt \u2019 s too bad that that happens because many who chose to maintain an unvaccinated status clearly have well-thought out reasons supporting their choice .\nLikewise , those who wish to fully vaccinate themselves or their children have their own supporting reasons as well .\nEach side , for lack of a better term , is so very passionate .\nIt isn \u2019 t too often that I see it , but I think that each side could quite easily meet in the middle .\nHow ?\nBy trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s been done before and continues to be done as I witnessed late Friday morning while reading .\nSometimes exchanges end with positive results .\nOther times - like that recent thread of comments left on that random article I chose to read - not so much .\nKnowing it was a pro-vaccine article even before I opened the link , I told myself not to go near the comments , but I was curious .\nSo I read them .\nAll of them .\nNow , I could have been all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of pro-vaccine commenters continued to have zero respect for parents like me , but when I reread their posts , I thought , Hey !\nThese guys might actually have a good idea .\nRemember one of them suggested that The Unvaccinated should be corralled into their own society ?\nKnowing what I know about The Unvaccinated and how they \u2019 re years ahead of Science and also so very knowledgeable when it comes to natural health options , I don \u2019 t think kicking us out of society is a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and settled in , I imagine the space that The Unvaccinated would be calling home would evolve into a \u2018 green \u2019 initiative .\nWith all of us working together , it would be holistic , therapeutic and cultivated for organic gardening .\nIt would be free of what ails The Unvaccinated \u2013 things like gluten , dairy and toxic chemicals .\nIt would be free of other things , too , like situations of having to defend my stance on a particular topic that \u2019 s now constantly referred to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have respectful conversations about vaccines and such , but I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 d spend too much time on that .\nI would instead focus my efforts on other topics like healing my child .\nWith the help of some of the hardest working parents I \u2019 ve ever encountered , who are also not allowed to mingle with the public , I know that healing really could happen .\nFree to be in a place to think and do what \u2019 s best for my vaccine-injured child isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oasis .\nWould I miss anything from the real world though ?\nOf course .\nIf ever I do find myself sent to a concentration camp-like setting that one the pro-vaccine commenter suggested I and other parents belong , I \u2019 d miss those closest to me who don \u2019 t view vaccines as I do .\nI \u2019 d love nothing more than to have them join The Unvaccinated .\nOur opinions differ .\nOur vaccine statuses differ , too .\nThat could happen but not until our major differences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , at least my friends are respectful of my opinion that vaccines are not entirely safe or entirely effective .\nFriends I have may not like my opinion , but they respect it .\nSo , yes , if I became a castoff , I \u2019 d miss them dearly .\nBut after reading the hateful , negative comments online the other day , and after the week of vaccine-injury and autism-hell that Ronan \u2019 s been through \u2013 the seizure activity , the public meltdowns , the unfortunate communication struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to send me away to a community where parents like me and families like mine can live in peace , I \u2019 ll take it

"content": "The other thing is that we are made to believe in the public eye that this is a vaccine against a viral infection .\nSo , the entire world is thinking that this is a vaccine to protect us against SARS-COV2 infection .\nAnd when you have a vaccine that is supposed to be effective as a vaccine , you are supposed to have antibody immunity against the SARS-COV2 virus .\nAnd that has never been evaluated with these injections as to whether or not we have antibody immunity to a SARS-COV2 virus .\nInstead , what we have is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a piece of the SARS-COV2 virus , and that piece is called the spike protein .\nAnd the technology that is being used is a technology to make this injection that has never been used in vaccine science or methodology before with any kind of success .\nAnd so , there \u2019 s automatically this assumption that when the authorities say these injections are safe , that we actually have adequate data and adequate observational data to understand whether or not these injections are safe .\nThe bottom line is we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand their safety .\nWhen studies are done on injections that are thought to be vaccines , we sometimes need 7 , 10 , or even 15 years , to understand what the injection does to the body , and what it does to those around us .\nMany of you know who Dr. Larry Palevsky is , and for those who do n't , he is a NY pediatrician who has spoken out about the dangers of vaccines since the late 1990s , when a mother in his practice showed him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was administering to the children in his practice .\nThat moment changed his life , and he began to do further research into vaccines .\nFor those of us who have children who have been harmed and/or killed by `` routine '' childhood vaccinations , Dr. Palevsky is a trusted and deeply appreciated rare gem among doctors .\nHe speaks out often , and you can do a search of his name to listen to some of his public speeches , including his powerful testimony before the CT legislature in February , 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me today is a portion of an interview with him .\nI can not find the full interview , but found this portion so compelling after listening to it 3 times that I decided to transcribe it .\nI hope you will first listen to it , then use the attached transcript to read any part you would like to reference again .\nClick on the second video at the link below ( first is of a female , second is Dr. Palevsky ) .\nIt is 12-minutes long , and worth listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been wondering if those injected with the new `` vaccines '' are shedding that which might harm others with whom they come in contact , with the suspicion that they likely are .\nThank you to Laura Hayes for transcribing a 12 minute primer on spike protein production and Covid vaccination by Dr. Larry Palevsky .\nDr. Palevsky brings up what can only be called horrifying questions , all unanswered because the powers that be have never asked .\nBy design .\nIt 's `` easy '' to say that what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nInformally called , the blind eye .\nBy Laura Hayes So , we are essentially taking the genetic instructions that make a synthetic spike protein , believed to be a part of the SARS-COV2 virus , and we are giving those sets of instructions into the body and asking the human body to take the genetic instructions of that spike protein and make more of it in our own machinery .\nAnd so this messenger RNA technology , which is what it is called , is delivering the genetic instructions for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem is that no study has ever been done to test its safety .\nBut , also , no study has been done to test whether we turn on the production of that spike protein , and ever turn it off .\nAnd so spike protein in the naturally occurring SARS-COV2 viral infection has been shown to cause brain inflammation and neurological damage , heart attacks , lung disease , liver disease , kidney disease , and interacting with the male and female reproductive systems , along with affecting blood binding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know that the natural disease of SARS-COV2 , because of the effects of the spike protein , is making people sick with all of these kinds of systemic illnesses .\nAnd so now we are taking that spike protein genetic instructions and we are asking our bodies to make more of that spike protein .\nAnd so by making more of that spike protein , we are essentially creating the symptoms and the illness of Covid 19 , by giving people the potential to have brain damage and neurological damage , lung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heart attacks , strokes , blood clotting issues , and impairments to male and female reproductive systems .\nAnd there is no study to show whether when the body starts manufacturing this synthetic spike protein , whether or not we ever turn off the production of that spike protein .\nAnd so that spike protein is known to be pretty damaging to the human tissue .\nSo we know that spike protein has been found in saliva , we know that it has been found in the anus , and so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it found in the exhalation molecules that come out of our breath ?\nIs it found in the skin when we sweat and we smell , do the spike proteins come out , and if so , does that impact other people with whom we come in contact ?\nAnd so what we have been seeing is a massive increase in those who have been given the injection of blood clotting problems , miscarriages , stillborns , infertility , strokes , heart attacks , autoimmune diseases , and death , just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s in those who have been injected .\nSo , certainly , there should be a suspicion when you see people around the injected people , who have not been injected , getting the typical symptoms of Covid , in addition to miscarriages , bleeding , irregular menstrual cycles , it should raise a very , very strong suspicion .\nNow , the spike protein is , we are told , just specific to the SARS-COV2 virus .\nSo , when your body makes the synthetic spike protein , you are supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack the spike protein .\nNow , we don \u2019 t know if that spike protein production keeps going and going and going , and that would make the antibody production keep going and going and going as well .\nAnd the thing is that we are finding that the genetic instructions of the spike protein are not specific just to the SARS-COV2 virus .\nThe genetic instructions of the spike protein are also similar to , or the same , as many proteins that exist in the body itself .\nAnd so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce an antibody against the genetic instructions of the spike protein , those antibodies are going to find every bit of protein tissue around the body that matches the genetic instructions of the spike protein .\nAnd that antibody to the spike protein genetic instructions is going to produce an attack on any of the proteins and tissues in the body that are similar or the same to the genetic instructions of the spike protein .\nSo that is why you will see autoimmune diseases .\nBut , many months ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the European literature where there were several proteins in the male and female reproductive systems that were found to have similar genetic instructions to the genetic instructions of the spike protein .\nAnd the scientist raised the concern that if we inject the genetic instructions of the spike protein into the body and cause the body to make an antibody against the genetic instructions of the spike protein , we will also cause the body to make an antibody against the male and female reproductive systems because those proteins in the male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spike protein .\nAnd he raised a very strong concern about it , because his concern was that it would basically immobilize and take out sperm from being able to fertilize an egg , and that it would also impair the egg itself , and that it would also impair the placenta .\nAnd so the experts around the world did the following\u2026when they heard this scientific concern , the experts around the world said , oh , but the amount of genetic instructions of the proteins in the male and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarity to the genetic instructions of the spike protein , that it really shouldn \u2019 t make a difference .\nAnd , ladies and gentlemen , that is how we got the science that said there should be no concerns about infertility or miscarriages in men and women , respectively .\nThere were no studies , just an opinion , that said the genetic instructions of the proteins on the male and female reproductive systems were such small similarities to the spike protein , that it shouldn \u2019 t matter .\nAnd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd so what we are seeing in women who get the injection , is a very large , hundreds of percent increase , in miscarriages and stillborns of their babies , all being reported to VAERS .\nAnd now what we are seeing is women who are around others who have been injected are having the same experience , which has to raise the suspicion that not only does that messenger RNA make the body produce spike protein on an ongoing basis , but that spike protein is probably shedding out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , and who knows where else in the body it is being shed from .\nJust the last point before you ask me the next question .\nThat is only based on what we think we know is in these injections .\nBut Dr. Tenpenny and I have discussed this on numerous occasions , that there is potential for other mRNA proteins being injected into the body that would cause the body to make all sorts of proteins that we may not be aware of .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

enormous pressure to get your shot .\nJoe Biden was on TV yesterday talking about vaccines .\nHe wants you to get one .\nEveryone in authority wants you to get one .\n\u2026 We talk a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this show but in this this country .\nYou \u2019 d think you would know more about that than you do .\nWe know a lot about the upside of vaccines .\nWe \u2019 ve been completely in favor of vulnerable people taking vaccines , but what about the potential risks ?\nDo you know anything about the downside ?\nDo you know the answer to that question ?\nIt \u2019 s not Americans who \u2019 ve been killed by the virus.That \u2019 s a huge number .\nIt \u2019 s how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to prevent the virus .\n.\nTranscribed by Anne Dachel Here \u2019 s a very simple question : How many Americans have died after taking the COVID vaccine ?\nAt some point you probably will comply .\nIt \u2019 s just too difficult not to be vaccinated in this country .\nBut before you do comply ask yourself , do you know anything about the potential risks ?\nProbably you don \u2019 t know much .\nWe assume the risks are negligible\u2026 Every flu season for example , we give influenza shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every year a relatively small number of people seem to die after getting these shots .\nTo be precise , in 2019 , that number was 203 people .\nThe year before , 2018 , it was 119 people\u2026 .\nIn the big picture , we do not see those numbers as disqualifying \u2026 How do those numbers compare with the apparent death rate from the coronavirus vaccine now being distributed across the country ?\nThat \u2019 s worth knowing so we checked today and here \u2019 s the answer , and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government numbers that we just read to you from .\nHere they are : Between late December of 2020 and last month , a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting a COVID vaccine in the United States .\n3,362 , that \u2019 s an average of roughly 30 people every day .\nSo what does that add up to ?\nBy the way , that reporting period ended on April 23 , and we don \u2019 t have numbers past that , it \u2019 s not quite up to date , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people at that rate have died in the 12 days since .\nYou put it all together and that is a total of 3,722 deaths .\nThat \u2019 s almost 4,000 people who died after getting the COVID vaccine .\nThe actual number is almost certainly higher than that , perhaps vastly higher than that .\nThe data we just cited come from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System , VAERS .\nVAERS is managed of the CDC and the FDA .\nVAERS has received a lot of criticism over the years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have argued for a long time that VAERS undercounts vaccine injury .\nA report submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services in 2010 concluded that \u201c fewer than one percent of vaccine adverse events are reported by the VAERS system , \u201d fewer than one percent .\nSo what is the real number of people who apparently have been killed or injured by the vaccine ?\nWe don \u2019 t know that number , nobody does , and we \u2019 re not going to speculate about it on this show .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is happening now , for whatever reason , is not even close to normal .\nIt \u2019 s not even close to what we see in previous years with previous vaccines .\nMost vaccines are not accused of killing large numbers of people .\n\u2026 In just the first four months of this year , the U.S. government has recorded more deaths after COVID vaccinations than from all other vaccines administered in the United States between mid 1997 and the end of 2013 .\nThat is a period of 15 and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to VAERS , have died after getting the shot in four months in a single vaccination campaign than from all other vaccines combined over more than a decade and a half .\nChart that out .\nIt \u2019 s a stunning picture .\nNow the debate is over what it means .\nAgain there is a lot of criticism of the reporting system , Some people say , well it \u2019 s just a coincidence that someone gets their shot and then dies , possibly from other causes .\nNo one really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to one physician today who actively treats COVID patients .\nHe described what we \u2019 re seeing now as Whatever is causing it , it is happening as we speak .\nSo you \u2019 d think someone in authority might want to know what it is .\nWhat \u2019 s going on ?\nIf the vaccine injury reporting system is flawed , and clearly it is flawed , why hasn \u2019 t it been fixed ?\nAnd more to the point , why has there not been an independent vaccine safety board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassure people who stumble across official government numbers on the Internet ?\nBut amazingly , none of that has been done .\nNo one even mentions the numbers , and in fact , you \u2019 re not allowed to .\nYou \u2019 ll be pulled off the Internet if you do .\nThe people in charge do not acknowledge them .\nInstead they warn us what might happen if we don \u2019 t take the vaccine .\n\u2026 \u201c People who are not fully vaccinated can still die from COVID19 , \u201d Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is true .\nBut it is also misleading .\nNot all Americans are at similar risk from dying from COVID19 .\n\u2026 So those second two categories , the young and the healthy and the previously infected may add up , if you combine them , to hundreds of millions of people in this country .\nThe funny thing , the White House , the official policy makers who are designing the vaccine rollout do not acknowledge that those categories even exist .\nHealth authorities are pretending that everyone \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as everyone else \u2019 s , and that \u2019 s why Joe Biden has demanded that 70 percent of all Americans adults , regardless of age , regardless of health condition , regardless critically of pre-existing antibodies from previous infection , get the COVID shot by the 4th of July , two months from now or else .\nThis might be an acceptable policy , it would never be an ethical policy , but as a practical matter it might be acceptable for the country if COVID vaccines , we could show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we truly understood the long term effects of those vaccines .\nBut neither one of those things is true .\nWe know , according to the government reporting system , thousands of people have died after getting the shot .\nThat is true in this country where it \u2019 s hotly debated when it \u2019 s talked about at all , but it \u2019 s also true in European countries whose recordkeeping on this question is , if anything , more reliable than ours .\nMany thousands of other people appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nVAERS reports nearly 900 non fatal heart attacks in people who just received the shot .\n2,700 people reported unexplained chest pain .\nIn all , the vaccine , according to the government reporting system , appears to have contributed to 8,000 hospitalizations .\nSome of the side effects defy easy explanation .\nResearcher Alex Berenson has noted that coronavirus vaccines now account for almost one third of all tinnitus reports in the VAERS database , the ringing in your ears .\nThe American Tinnitus Association says it has received many questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford and UCLA have begun tracking corona vaccine side effects across eight separate countries .\nWhat have they found ?\nAmong other things , \u201c Women aged 18 to 34 years old had a higher rate of deep vein thrombosis than men of the same age.\n\u201d They also found that heart attacks were \u201c common in people 85 years and older who \u2019 ve taken the vaccine.\n\u201d They found some serious potential side effects in some children .\n\u201c \u2026anaphylaxis [ and ] appendicitis were more common in young people.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people have been hurt during a vaccination campaign .\nThat is bound to happen .\nWhat \u2019 s different this time and so striking is the reaction to these numbers .\n\u2026 In 1976 the U.S. government vaccinated 45 million people for the swine flu .\nA total of 53 people reportedly died after getting that shot , and the U.S. government immediately halted the vaccination halted the vaccination program .\nWhy ?\nBecause authorities decided it was too risky .\nIt wasn \u2019 t worth it .\nContrast that with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our health authorities have reserved their energy for anyone who dares to question vaccines .\nLifesite News , it \u2019 s a nonprofit news organization , just found itself permanently banned from Facebook .\nWhy ?\nBecause it reported government numbers from the VAERS database , something we just did , on the air .\nFamously when podcaster Joe Rogan asked whether healthy young people ought to be getting the COVID vaccine , the media treated him like a war criminal .\n\u2026 He did nothing of the sort .\nAlmost everything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very simple and potentially relevant question that he asked , which is , should healthy young people receive the vaccine .\nWe \u2019 re not precisely sure what the risks are .\nIt is a lie to say there are no risks .\nThere are risks in everything , including getting a vaccine .\nSo why not rationally weigh the risks/reward ratio as we do with every decision we make ?\nFor that he was denounced as an anti-vaxxer kook , a danger to public safety .\nKeep in mind that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this piece : \u201c 5 things Bill Gates wants you to know about COVID19 variants.\n\u201d One of the very few elected officials in the country who has said a word about any of this , who \u2019 s asked the obvious question not attacking vaccines , wondering about their effect , which is a legitimate thing to do , is Republican senator , Ron Johnson of Wisconsin .\nLast week Johnson asked Francis Collins , director of NIH , why so many Americans , according to the government \u2019 s own numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shot .\nMaybe there \u2019 s a good answer for that .\nCollins wouldn \u2019 t even acknowledge that was happening .\nInstead Collins fretted that if the population focuses too much on the potential harm from vaccines , people might be hesitant to get them .\n\u201c I challenge his use of the term \u2018 Vaccine Hesitancy , \u2019 \u201d Ron Johnson told us in a conversation today .\nI told him that based on the VAERS deaths and my conversations with people who have chosen not to get vaccinated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People who are hesitant to be coerced into participating in the largest drug trial in history.\n\u2019 Why is that an unfair description exactly ?\nThere \u2019 s a reason many states have more vaccine doses than they can use .\nSome people just don \u2019 t want the vaccine , and that is their right , period .\nAnd not all of them are crazy .\nHealth decisions used to be considered personal choices .\nWe didn \u2019 t ask about them .\nThey were considered personal as recently as last fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the height of the presidential campaign , that a CNN reporter asked Kamala Harris whether she would be willing to take the coronavirus vaccine once it became available .\nHer response : \u201c Well I think that \u2019 s going to be an issue for all of us.\n\u201d Harris responded .\n\u201c I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump.\n\u201d A month later , at the vice-presidential debate , Harris was if anything more emphatic on the subject .\n\u201c If Donald Trump tells us we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it.\n\u201d Kamala Harris has since changed her mind .\nShe \u2019 s no longer skeptical of the vaccine .\nNor does she tolerate the skepticism of others .\nInstead , she \u2019 s an enthusiastic participant in COVID theater , and that \u2019 s the only name for it .\n\u2026 What exactly are we watching here ?\nWe \u2019 re watching the crudest kind of propaganda designed by the cynical for the benefit of a population they consider stupid and weak and malleable .\nAnd it \u2019 s not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , even the corporate comedians\u2026 It doesn \u2019 t make you laugh , it makes you nervous .\nWhy are they talking to you that way ?\nWhy are they giving you the finger on TV ?\nNo matter how many fingers they give you , it doesn \u2019 t change what remains true for the country .\nIf American citizens are going to be forced to take this vaccine or any other medicine , and they have an absolute right to know what it is and what its effects might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to ask that question without being censored or silenced or mocked or given the finger

causes disease ) with a transmissible viral vector.\n\u201d '' Self-spreading vaccines\u2014also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineered to move through populations in the same way as communicable diseases , but rather than causing disease , they confer protection .\nThe vision is that a small number of individuals in the target population could be vaccinated , and the vaccine strain would then circulate in the population much like a pathogenic virus .\nThese vaccines could dramatically increase vaccine coverage in human or animal populations without requiring each individual to be inoculated .\nThis technology is currently aimed primarily at animal populations.\n\u201d Among the technologies discussed in the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaccines that only need be given to a portion of the population , and are then become communicable between individuals , like a virus .\nPage 47 of the document reads in part : As the public roll out of the Covid-19 vaccines based on the spike protein began , we began to see widespread reports of in those who received the vaccine , including complications in menstrual cycles , and even miscarriages .\nResearch is currently underway at the The University of Illinois Urbana Champaign on the reproductive health outcomes of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became available to the public on April 7th , and by April 19th the researchers reported that they had received more than .\nIn the US the Janssen vaccine , and in Europe the AstraZenica vaccine were suspended in many areas and put under review for these side effects .\nAlthough Pfizer and Moderna had more reports of blood clots and strokes than Janssen , no such suspension or review was undertaken of the mRNA vaccines .\nIn early May 2021 , the Salk Institute published an on a in Circulation Research confirming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a respiratory disease as had initially been assumed .\n\u201c A lot of people think of it as a respiratory disease , but it \u2019 s really a vascular disease , \u201d says Assistant Research Professor , who is co-senior author of the study .\n\u201c That could explain why some people have strokes , and why some people have issues in other parts of the body .\nThe commonality between them is that they all have vascular underpinnings.\n\u201d Further , it implicated the spike protein itself in causing damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new study , the researchers created a \u201c pseudovirus \u201d that was surrounded by SARS-CoV-2 classic crown of spike proteins , but did not contain any actual virus .\nExposure to this pseudovirus resulted in damage to the lungs and arteries of an animal model\u2014proving that the spike protein alone was enough to cause disease .\nTissue samples showed inflammation in endothelial cells lining the pulmonary artery walls .\nThe team then replicated this process in the lab , exposing healthy endothelial cells ( which line arteries ) to the spike protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged the cells by binding ACE2 .\nThis binding disrupted ACE2 \u2019 s molecular signaling to mitochondria ( organelles that generate energy for cells ) , causing the mitochondria to become damaged and fragmented .\nPrevious studies have shown a similar effect when cells were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus , but this is the first study to show that the damage occurs when cells are exposed to the spike protein on its own .\n\u201c If you remove the replicating capabilities of the virus , it still has a major damaging effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of its ability to bind to this ACE2 receptor , the S protein receptor , now famous thanks to COVID , \u201d Manor explains .\n\u201c Further studies with mutant spike proteins will also provide new insight towards the infectivity and severity of mutant SARS CoV-2 viruses.\n\u201d This gave us an explanation of how the vascular symptoms in vaccine recipients may be happening .\nBut the strange part of the story is that reports on social media have begun circulating that these same vascular symptoms , nose bleeds , bruising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were being experienced by the unvaccinated who had recently spent time with one or more vaccinated individuals , or even in large crowds .\nSuch reports are now widespread on social media , but as the individuals reporting this bizarre phenomenon are not vaccine recipients , there is no where to report these potential second hand adverse events , as VAERS is a reporting system for only for vaccinated individuals .\nThis week , members of the public started taking a harder look at the vaccine manufacturers public disclosures about the vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , included questions on outcomes in pregnant and breastfeeding women who had NOT received the vaccine , but had been exposed to those who had .\nThis query about outcomes of \u201c environmental \u201d exposure to their product shows that Pfizer at least suspected that transmission via \u201c inhalation \u201d or \u201c skin contact \u201d was possible , as were adverse outcomes to the unvaccinated in contact with the vaccinated .\n\u2022 A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention due to environmental exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during pregnancy : \u2022 A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact .\n\u2022 A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception.\n\u201d Study investigators are then instructed to follow and report on the pregnancy until it 's termination , and report serious adverse events .\n\u201c Abnormal pregnancy outcomes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE ( ie , ectopic pregnancy , spontaneous abortion , intrauterine fetal demise , neonatal death , or congenital anomaly ) , the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs .\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safety as SAEs follows : \u2022Neonatal deaths that occur within 1month of birth should be reported , without regard to causality , as SAEs .\nIn addition , infant deaths after 1month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the study intervention.\n\u201c Similar instructions are given on tracking on breast feeding women .\nAn exposure during breastfeeding occurs if : ... \u2022A female is found to be breastfeeding while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention ( ie , environmental exposure ) .\nAn example of environmental exposure during breastfeeding is a female family member or healthcare provider who reports that she is breastfeeding after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact.\n\u201d Because these individuals are not enrolled in the study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure \u201d to Pfizer 's BNT162 RNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccine are not included in the study outcomes .\nInvestigators are given instructions to simply keep the SAE reports \u201c in the investigator site file.\n\u201d Where is that information ?\nThe questions that the public are asking are becoming widespread , and seem currently unanswerable .\nAre the vaccinated \u201c shedding \u201d something ?\nIf so , what are they \u201c shedding ?\n\u201d The spike protein ?\nInstructions for it 's cellular manufacture via viral vector ?\nIf so , how ?\nUntil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed

?\nWhy \u2019 d you get the vaccine ?\nDid you research it thoroughly , or did you blindly trust ?\nWere you forced to get it , or was it a choice ?\nDid you have a reaction ?\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All

belittle or outrageously pressure me into any other unnecessary liability-free vaccines either .\nShe did only what we came there to have done .\nShe provided my nonverbal , medically complicated son

some basic ones done that day .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor issues we \u2019 ve been noticing were suggested .\nOnce we get the lab results back and we get a bigger picture of what else may be going on we \u2019 ll tweak that supplement list .\nI \u2019 m thankful that some issues can be managed from home and that this doctor prefers a gentler approach .\nDrugs could be an option but are never her

knowledgeable on several of the major problems we \u2019 ve faced in the past .\nHaving a positive relationship with her and her team helped .\nThat \u2019 s why I comfortably agreed with her

still not go with them .\nHe knew the expectations for that part of the appointment , but he decided that no , he could not do it .\nJust like my simple answers earlier , his simple reply to my request to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThen he waved bye .\nTelling the overly kind ladies that we \u2019 d have to come back another day , they praised Ronan for trying and promised they \u2019 d be there to help him next time .\nI said thank you , and Ronan signed thank you .\nI didn \u2019 t have too many expectations for that day \u2019 s doctor \u2019 s visit , but I will next time .\nI expect that we

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite , and quite brusquely I might add , of what the vaccine injury story is stating .\nIt \u2019 s no wonder that new parents are thinking that maybe vaccines aren \u2019 t safe

acceptance from others .\nSince some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your medical practices , my circle of friends has grown .\nHow so , you might ask ?\nWhen you are being gruff and demanding with your my way or the highway attitude , you remove yourself from the equation and open the door for someone else to step in .\nWho is that someone ?\nMe !\nYes , me .\nAnd countless other moms and dads who step in to do what you \u2019 re called to do .\nIn case I lost you , let me break things down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their baby .\nWe \u2019 re raised to trust certain people and professionals .\nDoctors top that

with the school as a group , be sure that everyone has individually contacted someone within the administrative offices .\nPeople can begin their conversation with how this requirement affects their child and them personally .\nAsk all the questions , the ones you already know the answers to and also the hard ones .\nI started off my conversation politely , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nice .\nBut because I needed that one person who had all the information to tell me everything she knew .\nOther people may have called and yelled , or have given the college a what for , or have threatened to take legal action before they had all of the answers .\nYelling angrily is a strategy , but it has the potential to immediately turn people away , including the people who might be able to help .\nI used a different tactic and got most of my questions answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest is to take notes , keep track of who you speak to and see who gets cc \u2019 d on replies from the school .\nSome

author of It 's Not a Perfect World , But I 'll take it .\nBy Jennifer Rose Growing up autistic wasn \u2019 t always easy for me .\nNot only did my disability make it rather difficult for me to make friends , but there weren \u2019 t a lot of girls \u201c like me \u201d at my old school .\nSo my mother , god bless her , often took me to see other special needs families , with varying degrees of success .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest is my friendship with Olivia .\nNow , Olivia is significantly more disabled than I am , or even my younger sister- the contrast between the two of us is incredibly significant .\nIt \u2019 s much easier for me to go out and make friends than it is for McKenna to .\nAnd yet , whenever we meet up , it \u2019 s like a beautiful bond has connected between us .\nWe \u2019 ve known each other literally since grade school .\nShe was one of the first families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was known as something of a \u201c cool mom.\n\u201d She and Olivia would always have very stylish clothes when they went out , and Olivia became known around Morristown , New Jersey for her singing with her therapist Jammin Jenn .\nWe became even closer when she moved to my elementary school for a while , as we got to see each other more often .\nLikewise , her mom and my mom had a fantastic bond created by similar circumstances .\nSeveral years ago , my mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out for pizza .\nShe asked me if I wanted to come , and I was ambivalent at first .\nNot that I didn \u2019 t like seeing them , but I honestly wasn \u2019 t sure I \u2019 d be interested .\nEventually , I figured \u201c Ah , what the hell , it would be nice to get out of the house \u201d - I was bored at home and often spent my time watching movies or playing video games- so I agreed to her offer .\nAnd also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm slice of pizza ?\nWhen we met up at the restaurant , her mom was there to happily greet us .\n\u201c Oh , hi !\n\u201d my mom told her mom .\n\u201c We haven \u2019 t seen each other in ages !\n\u201d Olivia didn \u2019 t talk much , but I knew that , deep down , she appreciated me and my company \u201c I know , right ?\n\u201d said her mom .\n\u201c I \u2019 m so glad to see you !\nYou know , Olivia went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a group of boys approached her , and offered her to dance !\n\u201d \u201c Oh wow , Olivia !\n\u201d I said in a delightful tone of voice .\n\u201c That \u2019 s amazing !\n\u201d Eventually , the chatter spilled out into the typical chatter of special needs mothers .\n\u201c It seems as though we \u201c need \u201d an Autism Awareness Month , or we wouldn \u2019 t know that autism exists !\n\u201d said Mom .\n\u201c What do you think about that ?\n\u201d I asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it \u2019 s doing much for the cause , \u201d said Mom .\n\u201c Yeah , the other \u201c awareness \u201d months tend to be more effectual , like Lyme Disease Awareness Month \u201d I said .\n\u201c Soon , everyone \u2019 s going to be autistic , \u201d said Mom .\n\u201c I mean , Asperger \u2019 s no longer exists !\n\u201d", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

people ?\nSeveral of them had previously stated that they were pro-vaccine .\nThey were just not pro-vaccine for one of the COVID vaccines , which was the topic of that particular thread .\nThis woman stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and requested that the unvaccinated stop spreading misinformation .\nI was unsure why she asked that because previous comments left by others included vaccine data directly from government agencies that oversee the vaccine program .\nMaybe she didn \u2019 t like that some of that data was of documented vaccine injuries .\nFar from done replying to the very polite responses people were leaving her , regardless of where their data was being cited , she had one more thing to say .\nShe insisted that , \u201c The vaccine is helping you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your arm or not , the vaccine is the public good working for everyone . ''\nOne morning a little over a month ago , I was catching up on some posts in an online group .\nWhile sipping my coffee , I scrolled to the newest message .\nThe commenter said that people who choose not to vaccinate should \u201c thank the rest of us for taking public health seriously . ''\nAll of us `` \u2026should do our part to bring normal back to everyone .

the rest of us roll up our sleeves ?\nYou know long-term studies haven \u2019 t been done ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good luck with your experimental vaccine .\nThings got heated later on , and insults were lobbed at those saying no , thanks to the COVID shots .\nBut before that happened , it was like these people were reading my mind !\nRight off the bat , those who thought to question an experimental vaccine asked the woman why she cared so much about the rest of us getting it .\nShe got one .\nShe thought highly of herself for getting it .\nShe even said that in our arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public good .\nClaiming her vaccine helps the public good is a terrible argument and one that I will never agree with .\nEither way , she did what she wanted to do .\nShe took a chance and got vaccinated .\nShe was proud of that but also ticked as heck that others in the group would choose differently .\nLive your life , lady , and let us make a different decision .\nCan we , though ?\nCan we decide

vaccine intimidation efforts more than we already have been .\nOne reason I \u2019 ve heard for this latest push is because the federal government spent trillions of dollars during the pandemic .\nBut some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that .\nIt was overzealous of the government to spend all that money .\nIt was preposterous to also expect that every citizen would trust a fast-tracked , experimental , liability-free vaccine being peddled .\nBefore the roll out , we were told that it would be the best option to combat COVID .\nApparently , one of those experimental vaccines is now going to be the only option if the government has its way .\nThese representatives are saying that the vaccines will help us : If I could talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them : It \u2019 s a big waste of taxpayers \u2019 dollars to push this on me and millions like me .\nLike a strong-headed child who just won \u2019 t listen , though , the administration and the HHS Secretary , Xavier Becerra , haven \u2019 t gotten the hint yet .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to go where you are , \u201d Becerra said rather creepily in an interview .\nSounding more like a stalker than a humanitarian , he added , \u201c \u2026and we \u2019 ll do everything we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they don \u2019 t want .\nFauci \u2019 s message from this week is no better .\nWhen trying to explain how accessible the vaccine is to everyone , he offered this frustrated response : \u201c It \u2019 s easy to get , it \u2019 s free , and it \u2019 s readily available .\nSo , you know\u2026 what is the problem ?\nGet over it .\nGet over this political statement , just get over it.\n\u201d Saying no to the COVID vaccine is not a political statement .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitant \u201d either .\nDeclining to participate in the government \u2019 s vaccine program is based on a choice , a well-thought out one at that .\nSo , get over it ?\nNo , thanks , Tony .\nNo , thanks , Xavier and Joe , too .\nNo , thanks to that woman in the online group from last month also .\nKeep your vaccines .\nKeep them away from me .\nY \u2019 all are not the boss of me , and you never will be .\nI \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my family safe .\nI \u2019 m still doing my part my way now .\nI don \u2019 t know what life will look like for any of us when this ends , but I \u2019 m not going to let the ineptitude of those in office sway my decision .\nI \u2019 m certainly not going to cave to the bullying campaign they \u2019 re promoting nor allow my children to be their guinea pigs either .\nThe data being collected from those who have been vaccinated tells me these vaccines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be anyway .\nSome are causing serious , irreparable harm .\nWhat an awful realization for those people to have to face post-vaccination .\nI pray that whatever new normal they are dealing with is manageable .\nCathy Jameson is a Contributing Editor for Age of Autism .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

paying job .\nMany of these young adults also age out of school-based autism services and also struggle to find health care.\n\u201d The part of the story that really got my attention was Baskin

intellectual disability , too.\n\u201d If Baskin had checked the Boston Globe archives , she would have seen the 2007 Goldberg story on the severe lack of support for school age children with autism .\nThe failure of schools to accommodate the autism epidemic victims fourteen years ago is now being played out in adult services or the lack thereof .\nThe only difference here is that the adults with autism won \u2019 t be aging out of the system in 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be supported for the rest of their long lives , which could be 40 , 50 , 60 years after leaving school .\nIf Baskin had

another fourteen years and what impact that will have on schools and adult services .\nBaskin might also have checked into other more stunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 kids in South Korea ( back in 2011 ) , one in every 27 in Hong Kong and one in every 22 in Northern Ireland .\nShe might have looked into the official numbers from New Jersey , considered the most accurate reporting , one in every 34 children .\nShe would have had to have been alarmed over the one in every 14 in Brick Township , NJ , including one in every eight boys there .\nKara Baskin \u2019 s reporting in 2021 is no different from Carey Goldberg \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicative of the press in general .\nThe truth is members of the media have absolutely no interest in what \u2019 s happening to our children .\nThat \u2019 s why I have no interest in writing to them anymore .\nThey \u2019 re happy to move on to their next subject .\nReporters like Baskin and Goldberg are a big reason that officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been able to cover up the truth about autism increases for the last two decades .\nAs a teacher I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers and lack of services , any third grader would realistically ask any of the following : Why are there more kids with autism ?\nWhy can \u2019 t young adults with autism go where adults with autism have always gone ?\nWhat did they do with autistic adults 10 , 20 and 50 years ago ?\nIf there weren \u2019 t a lot of autistic adults in the past , why was that ?\nEach one of these questions would be a great subject line for a news source

store .\nWhile Mom was getting our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d peek at the wild headlines .\nHeadlines are meant to grab readers \u2019 attention .\nOne certainly grabbed my attention on the Yahoo !\nmain page last week : How To Deal With Friends Who Won \u2019 t Get Vaccinated I know what I need to do for myself and for my family , so I feel absolutely no pressure when I read stuff like that .\nI clicked the link , though , to see how others are \u201c dealing with \u201d this situation because curiosity got the best of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , I quickly found two statements that were false : - Unvaccinated individuals are at a greater risk for contraction [ of COVID19 ] than vaccinated ones .\n- Their reasoning [ to not get the vaccine ] tends to be rooted in emotions rather than science .\nA recent news report from the BBC proves that vaccinated individuals can contract the illness , and data being collected by the Kaiser Family Foundation ( KFF ) shows that adults are researching vaccine science before making a decision .\nTheir reasons for declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects but also because of the newness of the vaccine .\nOther reasons for saying no are that some just don \u2019 t want the vaccine .\nSome don \u2019 t trust the government , and some think they do not need the vaccine .\nAll those important reasons aside , I did agree with this part of that article when the author shared that : -Your social boundaries must be respected Yes !\nThis !\nAll day long !\n\u2026you can ask that they [ the unvaccinated ] respect your boundaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pressuring them to get vaccinated .\nPlease , if there \u2019 s anything this short article can impart , let this be the takeaway \u2013 don \u2019 t pressure anyone to get a vaccine they don \u2019 t want or need .\nMost people I know who have not opted for a COVID shot by now aren \u2019 t going to get one .\nYou can bully them , bribe them , jeopardize their rights , or call them every awful

that Autism Essentials is just about how vaccines can cause autism , because it isn \u2019 t .\nThe link is clearly talked about because there are just too many parents out there who watched their normally developing children lose learned skills and regress into autism following routine childhood vaccinations .\nThe preface , entitled , Dr. Andy Wakefield : The Story You Haven \u2019 t Heard , is where I say once again what I said about Dr. Wakefield in The Big Autism Cover-Up , namely that he was made the fall guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of the British government .\nI felt honored that Dr. McCabe asked me to write the preface in Autism Essentials , focusing on the Andy Wakefield story\u2014 the real story about this doctor .\nIn that book I devoted a whole chapter to the Dr. Andrew Wakefield story because of his leading role in the whole debate over a vaccine link .\nAs you can tell from title , it covered the lies and corruption surrounding the link between autism and vaccines .\nI wrote a book about all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Autism Cover-Up-How and Why the Media is Lying to the American Public .\nI like to say my qualifications for any of the writing I do is that I read .\nI have spent twenty years studying everything about autism .\nThat \u2019 s not to say I know everything there is out there , but I \u2019 ve amassed a good deal of knowledge .\nI \u2019 ve been writing for Age of Autism since 2007 , mostly about the controversy over vaccines and autism and the exponential increases in the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I decided to review this book in several separate pieces .\nHere goes the first .\nThis book has so much good information on the real world of autism that I hardly know where to begin .\nA number of the writers are people I \u2019 ve known and respected for years and others who are new to me .\nAll of them have something vital to say about autism .\nAutism Essentials is a collection of articles by over 30 writers , edited by Dr. Andy McCabe , a psychologist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who has an extensive background in autism .\nBy Anne Dachel Every once in a while it is my great pleasure to talk about a book on autism that is really well-designed to inform and help parents and other people involved with autism .\nAutism Essentials , as the cover tells us , is about \u201c prevention , causes , remediation , education , vocation , and legal aspects and parental advice \u201d regarding autism .\nWakefield was a practicing gastroenterologist at the Royal Free Hospital in London when he reported on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in twelve children who regressed into autism and bowel disease .\nEight of those children had parents who said the regression happened directly following their mumps , measles and rubella vaccination .\nDuring an interview in 2009 , Wakefield told CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson the real story about his work , \u201c Our duty was not only to investigate those children to see if we could get to the root of their symptoms , in particular their bowel symptoms , their diarrhea , their pain , and their mal-digestion , but also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents who told Wakefield and the other doctors that regression followed the MMR and that was included in their report .\nWakefield \u2019 s work concluded that the children had a new form of bowel disease , one that had not previously been identified .\nFurther study was recommended .\nThis is what was written up in the Lancet , a British medical journal in 1998 .\nWhat followed was a disaster for the researchers .\nWakefield especially was vilified as a fraud who falsified his findings .\nDuring that 2009 interview Wakefield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting in a 250 page report , he cautioned parents to only give their children separate mumps , measles and rubella vaccines , not the combination MMR vaccine .\nHe went on to say that the response from the government was that within six months they stopped the use of the separate vaccines in Britain .\nChildren could only get the combined MMR .\nWakefield made it clear on CBS back in 2009 that he and his fellow researchers had called for more study on the safety of the MMR .\nWhen he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Medical Council in revoking his medical license , Wakefield said that the government will \u201c isolate and discredit \u201d anyone who challenges them .\nWakefield furthermore denied any personal conflicts of interest in what he had done .\nThe phrase \u201c isolate and discredit \u201d can also apply to the actions of the media and the government here in the U.S .\nIn the preface I go into detail about how the American media attacked Wakefield in 2010 .\nMatt Lauer on NBC \u2019 s Today Show , Dr. Manny Alvarez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanjay Gupta on CNN , and George Stephanopoulos on ABC \u2019 s Good Morning America , all of them covered the Wakefield story as adversaries .\nTheir interviews were vicious inquisitions .\nIncredibly , not one of them talked to any of the parents of the children Wakefield cared for , although the parents had made public statements of support .\nNone of them could cite anything in Wakefield \u2019 s book , Callous Disregard , which was his account of the Lancet study .\nWakefield tried as hard as he could to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he simply wasn \u2019 t allowed to .\nThe fix was in .\nMajor networks gave him coverage in order to discredit him and any possibility of a link between vaccines and autism .\nOne critically important point that Wakefield wrote about in his book and that he tried to bring up during the interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN was the existence of a whistle-blower in the U.K. who had given him evidence of government collusion .\n( It seems that health officials there have close ties to the pharmaceutical industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that the evidence he \u2019 d been given showed that the British government knew the MMR vaccine was not safe and that they had indemnified that vaccine makers .\nThat meant the government would be held responsible if the truth about damaging side effects came to light .\nIf Wakefield had done all the things he was accused of by British reporter Brian Deer , surely the parents of his patients and the other doctors he worked with would have spoken out against him .\nNone of them did .\nThe parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood by their findings on bowel disease in these children , although not on an established link to the MMR .\nWakefield himself never claimed he found a link between the vaccine and autism .\nHe reported what the parents told him .\nHe called for more research and a halt to the use of the combined MMR vaccine until safety was established .\nIn a perfect world he would have been taken seriously and thorough , independent research would have happened to insure the safety of the MMR .\nThat is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corruption , collusion and cover-up , no credibility could be given to anyone who challenges the narrative that vaccines are safe , vaccines save lives .\nThank you , Dr. McCabe , for giving me an opportunity to tell the true story about Andrew Wakefield .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

Cindy and some others\u2014hey , let \u2019 s do a cost of disease paper , because there is a literature on the cost of disease .\nMost and almost all of it , until very recently , almost all it has assumed that the rates of autism prevalence are constant , which is a spectacular error .\nFirst of all , they tend the latest numbers so they underestimate the cost of autism in children , and then they assume that whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we \u2019 re observing in the elderly .\nSo they will assign all those costs , and they \u2019 ll put a model together that \u2019 ll say , this is the cost of autism in elderly .\nAnd they \u2019 ll add all that up , and they \u2019 ll come up with a number that \u2019 s too high for the total cost , but that underestimates the cost in children and dramatically overstates\u2014makes up fansome numbers for cost in the elderly that don \u2019 t exist .\nSo that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most cost of disease study , and we sought to correct that .\nThat was the idea .\nPart 2 follows tomorrow .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/660915480/0/ageofautism.html", "published": "2021-08-03T06:00:00-04:00", "published_utc":

For years I \u2019 ve written about something I call \u201c the really big lie about autism.\n\u201d That is the continual and baseless claim that all the autism everywhere among our children is merely the result of \u201c better diagnosing/greater awareness/expanded definition \u201d of a disorder that \u2019 s always been around .\nIf these increases are real , it \u2019 s an enormous problem .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it \u2019 s an enormous drain on families and services .\nIf you \u2019 re a public health official or bureaucrat , you like to get on top of problems that create opportunities , that serve your interests , that allow you to mount a program and to be a hero and say , look at all we \u2019 re doing .\nIf they knew what was going on in a way that led them to a solution that they liked , they \u2019 d have it for us .\nAnd because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only possible response for an official like that is to say , \u201c Well , I \u2019 m not sure .\nI don \u2019

obligated to address it .\nAnd they don \u2019 t have an answer that they like .\nThe obvious answers must be environmental causes , and there \u2019 s no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take on the plausible culprits because they involve corporations , they involve the medical institution , the failures of medical policies and practices .\nI try to avoid , Anne , the vaccine question because that becomes a red flag .\nI have my own beliefs , but for this purpose , scientifically , I put those beliefs aside .\nI think the most important thing is that we focus on the cost and the problem .\nThis problem could have many causes , multiple causes .\nAll we have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes and we must address them .\nWe must , almost urgently , immediately figure out what \u2019 s going on so we can pause it , so we can reverse it , so we can change the trend .\nThe act of saying we think this is a crisis and the numbers are real , and the costs are real requires you , obligates you , mandates that a

"content": "There are just so many effects of autism on the parents .\nThere \u2019 s a large burden that is borne by the parents .\nThere \u2019 s lost productivity .\nIt \u2019 s more often women than men , but there are subtle effects .\nPeople \u2019 s lives change , and they have fewer children .\nWe \u2019 ve all felt that .\nAutism and fighting for your autistic child is not a good career move .\nRight now most of the autistic population is children , and so what that means is parents pay .\nEither they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lose the ability to work .\nSo there is lost parental productivity .\nMark : The question of who pays is going to be a big one , and what we know is that we will see a massive shift in who pays .\nQuestion 4 : Where will we see the biggest drain on resources and funding : federal , state , or local levels ?\nIncredibly all this seems to be happening with no questions being asked .\nSomehow it \u2019 s insensitive to talk about where all these kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of autistic children ages out of school and into the adult population , many more adjustments will have to be made , and we \u2019 ll all be paying for them .\nAutism awareness will be everywhere .\nWe \u2019 ve made other adjustments like sensitive Santas in stores at Christmas , autism-friendly movie showings , sensory/calming rooms in schools , to name only a few .\nMeanwhile there are endless stories from across the country over the last two decades about training people to deal with autistic children : fire fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , airport staff , librarians , doctors and lots of other groups .\nThe fact that we \u2019 re desperately short of services for these disabled young adults is more proof of lie we \u2019 ve been told .\nMy often repeated question has never been talked about : Why can \u2019 t young autistic adults go where autistic adults have always gone ?\nWe must have done something with them , even if we didn \u2019 t call them autistic .\nThe one thing no official has ever called for is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTelling us something but never having to show proof is pretty much the history of the federal government when it comes to autism .\nThat \u2019 s a delusion , yet it \u2019 s still going strong , no matter how bad the numbers get .\nOne of the convenient results of the lie that autism is nothing new in the human population is that it seems we \u2019 ve somehow been able to handle things .\nIf autistic people have always been around , we \u2019 ve provided for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their disability autism .\nN OTE : This is part 4 of a 5 part series running all week .\nParts 1 , 2 and 3 are below .\nAt the end of the series , we 'll reorganize to run it in order .\nThank you .\nBy Anne Dachel And to the extent that there are additional burdens is going to be the special education program in the local school system .\nThey \u2019 re largely paid for out of local taxes , to some extent state funds .\nThere will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very expensive , which are often funded by Medicaid or private insurance sometime .\nSo there \u2019 s a mix of funding , but the large majority is local , either the parents or the school system .\nThere \u2019 s no single constituency standing up and shouting , we \u2019 ve got to do something .\nOne thing that has happened is that the schools have by and large soaked it up .\nIt \u2019 s been a huge burden .\nIt \u2019 s been a drain on school budgets , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service or taking funds from other programs or raising taxes or whatever it is , school systems have largely absorbed the autism childhood population .\nIt \u2019 s become politically incorrect to complain about that .\nSo that has happened .\nAs children age out , parents are going to have to find\u2014and I just know my own experience .\nMy daughter has now entered the state services funding program .\n\u2026They \u2019 ve just set up an autistic division to deal with their new constituency of autistic adults .\nMy daughter now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the state .\nIt \u2019 s not funded by the school system .\nShe \u2019 s in a residential program because her aggression became tough for her mother to handle , and that is also paid for by the state .\nHer mother \u2019 s involvement , my involvement , we \u2019 re active , we \u2019 re taking care of the services , and the state still has money .\nThey haven \u2019 t seen the tsunami yet .\nThey \u2019 re seeing a meaningful increase in 20 somethings .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s in the paper , Anne .\nI don \u2019 t know if you \u2019 ve read every word , but the Social Security Administration audits the number of adults that receive funding by diagnostic category .\nThey added a number for people with autistic disorder in 2010 , and that number has exploded in just seven or eight years .\nFifteen percent a year increase .\nOf course that \u2019 s mostly going to be young adults .\nWe will see some federal funding , social security and social security disability payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for money .\nWe \u2019 re going to see this shift from a highly distributed and responsive network of payers , parents and schools , and it \u2019 s going to go to state and federal governments without parents as advocates .\nWhen my daughter is fifty , I won \u2019 t be here .\nShe \u2019 s 25 now , so whenever I leave and her mother leaves , all of a sudden there \u2019 s a binary shift and she \u2019 s a ward of the state .\nThe state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They \u2019 ll try , but things fall through the cracks .\nPeople aren \u2019 t observed well .\nThere \u2019 s turnover in the service providers .\nPeople don \u2019 t remember what happened 10 years ago .\nThey start making mistakes .\nThey compound .\nThere \u2019 s negligence .\nThere \u2019 s boredom .\nThis is a difficult population to handle .\nMost of them are men , and most of them can get violent on occasion .\nThey \u2019 ll be restrained , and they may even be mistreated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very , very bleak future that we \u2019 re looking at with big government taking care of troubled autistic adults without the parents to support them , and I worry about that shift .\nPart 3 By Anne Dachel For years I \u2019 ve written about something I call \u201c the really big lie about autism.\n\u201d That is the continual and baseless claim that all the autism everywhere among our children is merely the result of \u201c better diagnosing/greater awareness/expanded definition \u201d of a disorder that \u2019 s always been around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in the autism has been announced , there was always some federal official assuring the public that they weren \u2019 t sure IF THIS INCREASE represented a true increase in the number of children with autism .\nTheir real meaning was FROM THE LAST OFFICIAL INCREASE , but they knew that the media lackeys would spin the message to read , THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A REAL INCREASE IN AUTISM .\nAs long as that lie works , they can all relax .\nAutism only requires recognition and services .\nAllocate more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2006 I was in Washington with two doctors visiting congressional offices .\nWe had an appointment with the chief of staff of my representative , Dave Obey of Wisconsin .\nDuring our meeting we laid out the evidence on the increases in autism and the cost predictions .\nObey \u2019 s chief of state \u2019 s response was this : \u201c So what \u2019 s the solution ?\nCongressmen don \u2019 t like problems without solutions.\n\u201d The three of responded together , \u201c We have to stop it.\n\u201d That pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t interested in what that would involve .\nQuestion 3 : Why aren \u2019 t health officials focused on this ?\nWhy do they continue to tell us with each new rate increase that they are still not sure if more children actually have autism ?\nMark : That \u2019 s a really interesting question .\nI think there are multiple answers .\nAt one level , most of the people in these jobs have relatively short career time horizons , so they \u2019 re looking for their next job .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf they can defer dealing with tough questions for two , five , 10 years , they don \u2019 t have to worry about it anymore .\nAutism parents have a much longer time horizon .\nOur time horizon is longer than our own lives .\nOur time horizon goes decades long We \u2019 re worried about the lives of our children when we \u2019 re gone , so we are the ones carrying the message .\nAt some level it \u2019 s just short term , long term thinking .\n.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is they don \u2019 t have a good answer that they like .\nIf these increases are real , it \u2019 s an enormous problem .\nIt \u2019 s an enormous cost to society , it \u2019 s an enormous drain on families and services .\nIf you \u2019 re a public health official or bureaucrat , you like to get on top of problems that create opportunities , that serve your interests , that allow you to mount a program and to be a hero and say , look at all we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was going on in a way that led them to a solution that they liked , they \u2019 d have it for us .\nAnd because of the size of the problem , the only possible response for an official like that is to say , \u201c Well , I \u2019 m not sure .\nI don \u2019 t know.\n\u201d Plead ignorance because as soon as you acknowledge that it \u2019 s real and it \u2019 s serious , that it \u2019 s monumental even in terms of the social costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\nAnd they don \u2019 t have an answer that they like .\nThe obvious answers must be environmental causes , and there \u2019 s no one in the scientific community that wants to take on the plausible culprits because they involve corporations , they involve the medical institution , the failures of medical policies and practices .\nI try to avoid , Anne , the vaccine question because that becomes a red flag .\nI have my own beliefs , but for this purpose , scientifically , I put those beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is that we focus on the cost and the problem .\nThis problem could have many causes , multiple causes .\nAll we have to do is to acknowledge that these are environmental causes and we must address them .\nWe must , almost urgently , immediately figure out what \u2019 s going on so we can pause it , so we can reverse it , so we can change the trend .\nThe act of saying we think this is a crisis and the numbers are real , and the costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mandates that a leading public health official takes on that policy question .\nYou know , they \u2019 re all cowards or worse , and they have not chosen to stand .\nA few years ago , the parent of a daughter with severe autism talked with me about the last IEP meeting he attended during her final year in high school .\nThe father asked the staff about what was next for his child .\nWhat adult programs would there be for her ?\nHer teachers had to admit that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs in the area at the same time they assured him that they were sure there would be something .\nIt was no big surprise for him to learn that no one is prepare for young adults with autism .\nHis daughter was moved from one program for developmentally disabled adults to another , with none of them equipped to deal with her behavioral needs .\nToday social services pays a relative to babysit her all day .\nThis is but one tiny example of the future that Mark Blaxill talks about here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things get if the autism rate increases continue at the rate they have in the past ?\nMark : It \u2019 ll get really bad .\nWe know that .\nI like to say that before 1930 , the rate of autism in the world was effectively zero .\nThen Leo Kanner discovered it in a handful of children who were born in the 1930s .\nHe wrote his paper in 1943 after seeing a bunch of children who were unlike any other group he \u2019 d ever seen before .\nHe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child psychiatry .\nFor many years thereafter , in the U.S. at least , the rates were really low , one in 10,000 .\nThen they began to tick up a little bit in the 70s and 80s , but in the late 90s they went vertical .\nWe haven \u2019 t seen the plateau in that curve .\nThe latest numbers we have are something like three percent in American children .\nThere are numbers that are even higher than that in some places .\nWhat that means is , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d be 90 today .\n\u2026 So there are people who are alive today who were around when there was no autism .\nThe first cases of autism , some of them are still alive .\nI have met a couple of them , but they are vanishingly rare .\nSo we have no system for elderly adults with autism whose parents are no longer with us .\nWe have been struggling all over the world in special education programs to deal with the onslaught of children .\nWhat we have not dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are now starting to age out of the school system , who will flood into an unprepared services infrastructure .\nThere is no infrastructure for autistic adults without parents .\nThey \u2019 ll require residential services ; they \u2019 ll require day programming services .\nWe will lose their productivity in the population .\nIn some cases , a few of the higher functioning adults will do productive work , so I don \u2019 t want to minimize that , but in large measure , these will be unemployed human beings who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThose costs have not yet ever been seen , they \u2019 ve not ever been paid for , and we are nowhere close to equipped to deal with it .\nWe are just now dealing with autistic young people in their 20s .\nMy daughter is 25 years old .\nShe was born in 1995 just as the rates were being to increase , and there are no services for her .\nThere are no programs for young autistic adults .\nI \u2019 m involved in an autism center .\nWe have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief financial officer .\nWe \u2019 ve just initiated a program for autistic adults , because there are none .\nThere are programs for intellectually disabled people , but not [ for ] the unique problems of people with autism .\nWe \u2019 re not prepared .\nEven then , most of the young people , if they \u2019 re young adults , their parents are in their 60s , 70s .\nThey \u2019 re still going .\nThey \u2019 re still taking care of their children .\nOne of my working titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Trillion Dollars When I Die .\nWe \u2019 re looking at numbers in the hundreds of billions .\nThey \u2019 re not small .\nWe \u2019 re going to see this tsunami hit .\nMost of the cost will be in young adults , and there will be no safety net because the parents are by and large , the safety net .\nWe \u2019 ll be gone .\nThere may be siblings , there may be relatives , but this is going to be a bleak scenario when we have literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom we \u2019 re not currently prepared to provide services .\nThey will be

talking a tripling under some scenarios .\nI hope we don \u2019 t get there .\nThe schools will break if we keep seeing the increases that we \u2019 re looking at .\nWe took some more moderate scenarios .\nWe said maybe those California numbers are going up faster more recently , what if some of that is the change to the DSM5 ?\nWe \u2019 ll put the peak lower .\nEven then , that \u2019 s our low scenario in the paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trillions of dollars because the number \u2019 s already so high .\nYou take three or four percent of the population and you apply that across the whole population , including adults , that \u2019 s 10 million people or more .\nWe don \u2019 t know what will happen .\nWe know we \u2019 ll have both problems .\nWe might have a worse problem by a couple of multiples in the school system .\nWe start running into real resource constraints really soon .\nAnd then when the safety nets go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 re in for a world of hurt .\nI don \u2019 t know how we \u2019 ll manage to provide for all these people .\nI \u2019 m really , really worried about it .\nI want to be shouting to the heavens : this paper is a very scientific , evidence based modeling of very real numbers that have been accepted broadly all over the world .\nIf you do the simple arithmetic , the system runs into some real problems .\nTrillions and trillions of dollars and it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part 4 of a 5 part series running all week .\nParts 1 , 2 and 3 are below .\nAt the end of the series , we 'll reorganize to run it in order .\nThank you .\nBy Anne Dachel What is autism going to cost ?\nOne of the convenient results of the lie that autism is nothing new in the human population is that it seems we \u2019 ve somehow been able to handle things .\nIf autistic people have always been around , we \u2019 ve provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t call their disability autism .\nThat \u2019 s a delusion , yet it \u2019 s still going strong , no matter how bad the numbers get .\nThe one thing no official has ever called for is a study on the autism rate among adults .\nTelling us something but never having to show proof is pretty much the history of the federal government when it comes to autism .\nMy often repeated question has never been talked about : Why can \u2019 t young autistic adults go where autistic adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done something with them , even if we didn \u2019 t call them autistic .\nThe fact that we \u2019 re desperately short of services for these disabled young adults is more proof of lie we \u2019 ve been told .\nMeanwhile there are endless stories from across the country over the last two decades about training people to deal with autistic children : fire fighters , ER personnel , police , teachers , airport staff , librarians , doctors and lots of other groups .\nWe \u2019 ve made other adjustments like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autism-friendly movie showings , sensory/calming rooms in schools , to name only a few .\nAnd as this population of autistic children ages out of school and into the adult population , many more adjustments will have to be made , and we \u2019 ll all be paying for them .\nAutism awareness will be everywhere .\nIncredibly all this seems to be happening with no questions being asked .\nSomehow it \u2019 s insensitive to talk about where all these kids are coming from .\nQuestion 4 : Where will we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : federal , state , or local levels ?\nMark : The question of who pays is going to be a big one , and what we know is that we will see a massive shift in who pays .\nRight now most of the autistic population is children , and so what that means is parents pay .\nEither they pay directly out of their pocket or they lose the ability to work .\nSo there is lost parental productivity .\nWe \u2019 ve all felt that .\nAutism and fighting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career move .\nThere \u2019 s lost productivity .\nIt \u2019 s more often women than men , but there are subtle effects .\nPeople \u2019 s lives change , and they have fewer children .\nThere are just so many effects of autism on the parents .\nThere \u2019 s a large burden that is borne by the parents .\nAnd to the extent that there are additional burdens is going to be the special education program in the local school system .\nThey \u2019 re largely paid for out of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere will be early intervention programs which can be very expensive , which are often funded by Medicaid or private insurance sometime .\nSo there \u2019 s a mix of funding , but the large majority is local , either the parents or the school system .\nThere \u2019 s no single constituency standing up and shouting , we \u2019 ve got to do something .\nOne thing that has happened is that the schools have by and large soaked it up .\nIt \u2019 s been a huge burden .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgets , but whether it \u2019 s through rationing of service or taking funds from other programs or raising taxes or whatever it is , school systems have largely absorbed the autism childhood population .\nIt \u2019 s become politically incorrect to complain about that .\nSo that has happened .\nAs children age out , parents are going to have to find\u2014and I just know my own experience .\nMy daughter has now entered the state services funding program .\n\u2026They \u2019 ve just set up an autistic division to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My daughter now has a day program that is funded by the state .\nIt \u2019 s not funded by the school system .\nShe \u2019 s in a residential program because her aggression became tough for her mother to handle , and that is also paid for by the state .\nHer mother \u2019 s involvement , my involvement , we \u2019 re active , we \u2019 re taking care of the services , and the state still has money .\nThey haven \u2019 t seen the tsunami yet .\nThey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethings .\nWe can look at that .\nIt \u2019 s in the paper , Anne .\nI don \u2019 t know if you \u2019 ve read every word , but the Social Security Administration audits the number of adults that receive funding by diagnostic category .\nThey added a number for people with autistic disorder in 2010 , and that number has exploded in just seven or eight years .\nFifteen percent a year increase .\nOf course that \u2019 s mostly going to be young adults .\nWe will see some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security disability payments .\nThe states are going to start asking for money .\nWe \u2019 re going to see this shift from a highly distributed and responsive network of payers , parents and schools , and it \u2019 s going to go to state and federal governments without parents as advocates .\nWhen my daughter is fifty , I won \u2019 t be here .\nShe \u2019 s 25 now , so whenever I leave and her mother leaves , all of a sudden there \u2019 s a binary shift and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe state is not generally a great caretaker .\nThey \u2019 ll try , but things fall through the cracks .\nPeople aren \u2019 t observed well .\nThere \u2019 s turnover in the service providers .\nPeople don \u2019 t remember what happened 10 years ago .\nThey start making mistakes .\nThey compound .\nThere \u2019 s negligence .\nThere \u2019 s boredom .\nThis is a difficult population to handle .\nMost of them are men , and most of them can get violent on occasion .\nThey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even be mistreated and abused .\nSo it \u2019 s a very , very bleak future that we \u2019 re looking at with big government taking care of troubled autistic adults without the parents to support them , and I worry about that shift .\nPart 3 By Anne Dachel For years I \u2019 ve written about something I call \u201c the really big lie about autism.\n\u201d That is the continual and baseless claim that all the autism everywhere among our children is merely the result of \u201c better diagnosing/greater awareness/expanded definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been around .\nEach and every time an official increase in the autism has been announced , there was always some federal official assuring the public that they weren \u2019 t sure IF THIS INCREASE represented a true increase in the number of children with autism .\nTheir real meaning was FROM THE LAST OFFICIAL INCREASE , but they knew that the media lackeys would spin the message to read , THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A REAL INCREASE IN AUTISM .\nAs long as that lie works , they can all relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAllocate more funds and life goes on .\nBack in 2006 I was in Washington with two doctors visiting congressional offices .\nWe had an appointment with the chief of staff of my representative , Dave Obey of Wisconsin .\nDuring our meeting we laid out the evidence on the increases in autism and the cost predictions .\nObey \u2019 s chief of state \u2019 s response was this : \u201c So what \u2019 s the solution ?\nCongressmen don \u2019 t like problems without solutions.\n\u201d The three of responded together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d That pretty much ended our conversation .\nShe wasn \u2019 t interested in what that would involve .\nQuestion 3 : Why aren \u2019 t health officials focused on this ?\nWhy do they continue to tell us with each new rate increase that they are still not sure if more children actually have autism ?\nMark : That \u2019 s a really interesting question .\nI think there are multiple answers .\nAt one level , most of the people in these jobs have relatively short career time horizons , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job .\nThey \u2019 re in for not very long .\nIf they can defer dealing with tough questions for two , five , 10 years , they don \u2019 t have to worry about it anymore .\nAutism parents have a much longer time horizon .\nOur time horizon is longer than our own lives .\nOur time horizon goes decades long We \u2019 re worried about the lives of our children when we \u2019 re gone , so we are the ones carrying the message .\nAt some level it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking .\n.\nAnother reason they don \u2019 t answer is they don \u2019 t have a good answer that they like .\nIf these increases are real , it \u2019 s an enormous problem .\nIt \u2019 s an enormous cost to society , it \u2019 s an enormous drain on families and services .\nIf you \u2019 re a public health official or bureaucrat , you like to get on top of problems that create opportunities , that serve your interests , that allow you to mount a program and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all we \u2019 re doing .\nIf they knew what was going on in a way that led them to a solution that they liked , they \u2019 d have it for us .\nAnd because of the size of the problem , the only possible response for an official like that is to say , \u201c Well , I \u2019 m not sure .\nI don \u2019 t know.\n\u201d Plead ignorance because as soon as you acknowledge that it \u2019 s real and it \u2019 s serious , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social costs , you \u2019 re obligated to address it .\nAnd they don \u2019 t have an answer that they like .\nThe obvious answers must be environmental causes , and there \u2019 s no one in the scientific community that wants to take on the plausible culprits because they involve corporations , they involve the medical institution , the failures of medical policies and practices .\nI try to avoid , Anne , the vaccine question because that becomes a red flag .\nI have my own beliefs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put those beliefs aside .\nI think the most important thing is that we focus on the cost and the problem .\nThis problem could have many causes , multiple causes .\nAll we have to do is to acknowledge that these are environmental causes and we must address them .\nWe must , almost urgently , immediately figure out what \u2019 s going on so we can pause it , so we can reverse it , so we can change the trend .\nThe act of saying we think this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the costs are real requires you , obligates you , mandates that a leading public health official takes on that policy question .\nYou know , they \u2019 re all cowards or worse , and they have not chosen to stand .\nA few years ago , the parent of a daughter with severe autism talked with me about the last IEP meeting he attended during her final year in high school .\nThe father asked the staff about what was next for his child .\nWhat adult programs would there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that they didn \u2019 t know of any specific programs in the area at the same time they assured him that they were sure there would be something .\nIt was no big surprise for him to learn that no one is prepare for young adults with autism .\nHis daughter was moved from one program for developmentally disabled adults to another , with none of them equipped to deal with her behavioral needs .\nToday social services pays a relative to babysit her all day .\nThis is but one tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks about here .\nQuestion 2 : How bad will things get if the autism rate increases continue at the rate they have in the past ?\nMark : It \u2019 ll get really bad .\nWe know that .\nI like to say that before 1930 , the rate of autism in the world was effectively zero .\nThen Leo Kanner discovered it in a handful of children who were born in the 1930s .\nHe wrote his paper in 1943 after seeing a bunch of children who were unlike any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe was the world \u2019 s leading expert in child psychiatry .\nFor many years thereafter , in the U.S. at least , the rates were really low , one in 10,000 .\nThen they began to tick up a little bit in the 70s and 80s , but in the late 90s they went vertical .\nWe haven \u2019 t seen the plateau in that curve .\nThe latest numbers we have are something like three percent in American children .\nThere are numbers that are even higher than that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you were born in 1930 , you \u2019 d be 90 today .\n\u2026 So there are people who are alive today who were around when there was no autism .\nThe first cases of autism , some of them are still alive .\nI have met a couple of them , but they are vanishingly rare .\nSo we have no system for elderly adults with autism whose parents are no longer with us .\nWe have been struggling all over the world in special education programs to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not dealt with is the tsunami of autistic adults who are now starting to age out of the school system , who will flood into an unprepared services infrastructure .\nThere is no infrastructure for autistic adults without parents .\nThey \u2019 ll require residential services ; they \u2019 ll require day programming services .\nWe will lose their productivity in the population .\nIn some cases , a few of the higher functioning adults will do productive work , so I don \u2019 t want to minimize that , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings who will be a weight on the economy .\nThose costs have not yet ever been seen , they \u2019 ve not ever been paid for , and we are nowhere close to equipped to deal with it .\nWe are just now dealing with autistic young people in their 20s .\nMy daughter is 25 years old .\nShe was born in 1995 just as the rates were being to increase , and there are no services for her .\nThere are no programs for young autistic adults .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe have just started .\nI \u2019 m the chief financial officer .\nWe \u2019 ve just initiated a program for autistic adults , because there are none .\nThere are programs for intellectually disabled people , but not [ for ] the unique problems of people with autism .\nWe \u2019 re not prepared .\nEven then , most of the young people , if they \u2019 re young adults , their parents are in their 60s , 70s .\nThey \u2019 re still going .\nThey \u2019 re still taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my working titles for this paper was Autism Will Cost a Trillion Dollars When I Die .\nWe \u2019 re looking at numbers in the hundreds of billions .\nThey \u2019 re not small .\nWe \u2019 re going to see this tsunami hit .\nMost of the cost will be in young adults , and there will be no safety net because the parents are by and large , the safety net .\nWe \u2019 ll be gone .\nThere may be siblings , there may be relatives , but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have literally millions of adults who are not for whom we \u2019 re not currently prepared to provide services .\nThey will be increasing in large numbers .\nMark Blaxill Autism Tsunami Part 1 Question 1 : Tell us about your study , Autism Tsunami : the Impact of Rising Prevalence on the Societal Cost of Autism in the United States .\nWhat motivated you and the other authors to look into the future impact of autism ?\nMark : My motivation has been 20 years long .\n( Inaudible ) \u2026and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the numbers were exploding .\nCalifornia and everywhere you looked , the numbers were going up , and that invalidated the orthodox story line .\n( Inaudible ) Mark dismissed the official claims of better diagnosing/diagnostic substitution .\nAnd we \u2019 ve known that for a long time , Anne .\nI first started writing about that in 2001 , 2003 , in that area .\nI started writing in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders when they started trying to blame it on diagnostic substitution .\nIt was obvious that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( inaudible ) I wrote to them .\nI got some colleagues to write .\n\u2026 The authors that argued that it was diagnostic substitution had to retract their findings because it was obvious that they were arithmetically wrong .\nThe rate of autism was going up , and the rate of intellectual disability was not declining .\nThen I wrote a paper that was published in 2004 , What \u2019 s going on ?\nThe question of time trends in autism .\nI argued that the rates were going up and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in the United States and the UK .\nI know you focus very heavily on the United States and the UK both of which have rates that are going up .\nAnd then I kept writing about it .\nI wrote another book called Denial , both with Dan Olmsted .\nOne in 2010 and another in 2017 .\nYou \u2019 re kind of screaming at the universe , please pay attention .\nThis is a crisis .\nAnne , you do this every day .\nI do this in longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the same work .\nOne thing that happened is that Cindy Nevison , whom I \u2019 ve gotten to know pretty well , and she \u2019 s doing very good work .\n\u2026on the environmental causes of autism .\nShe and I got together with a guy named Walter Zahorodny , who is the CDC \u2019 s man in New Jersey .\nAnd New Jersey has been reporting some of the highest rates of autism .\nWalter , in his own way , is saying the same thing .\nSo we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2018 .\nThe three of us were co-authors .\nI had been looking at the California numbers way back since 2001 , some of the early days .\nCindy had started looking at more recent numbers .\nWe compiled our databases .\nWe got this article published that said , you know these rates are exploding and they \u2019 re real .\nBy the time we \u2019 re doing that in 2018 , that \u2019 s 20 years after I first started looking .\nThe numbers are scarily higher , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed , if anything they look like they \u2019 re growing more rapidly .\n\u2026 Cynthia and I wrote another paper called Diagnostic Substitution , again showing that there \u2019 s no case that the increases are due to substitutes of intellectual disability .\nWhen they published the California paper in 2018 , which surprised me honestly , I was surprised because it goes against the orthodox narrative .\nGood for the journal .\nThey \u2019 ve been a pleasure to deal with because they \u2019 re interested in good evidence and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write it very rigorously .\nAs soon as that paper in 2018 , I wrote the idea to Cindy and some others\u2014hey , let \u2019 s do a cost of disease paper , because there is a literature on the cost of disease .\nMost and almost all of it , until very recently , almost all it has assumed that the rates of autism prevalence are constant , which is a spectacular error .\nFirst of all , they tend the latest numbers so they underestimate the cost of autism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever rates we \u2019 re observing in children , we \u2019 re observing in the elderly .\nSo they will assign all those costs , and they \u2019 ll put a model together that \u2019 ll say , this is the cost of autism in elderly .\nAnd they \u2019 ll add all that up , and they \u2019 ll come up with a number that \u2019 s too high for the total cost , but that underestimates the cost in children and dramatically overstates\u2014makes up fansome numbers for cost in the elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u2019 s an error , foundational error in most cost of disease study , and we sought to correct that .\nThat was the idea .\nPart 2 follows tomorrow .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/661278292/0/ageofautism.html", "published":

trust my family 's input on several topics .\nI also tend to like and agree with several things Mike Rowe has shared .\nI see many thoughtful take-aways from him , but the one part that stuck with me the longest hours after reading it was Mike Rowe 's regrets .\nHow many of us in our community have shared the regret of not listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical professional 's biased opinion as actual fact ?\nOf wishing we could 've done things differently ?\nI 'd say many of us have .\nRegrets can be unfortunate , but they can also keep us from making the same mistake again .\nTo Mike Rowe , thank you for sharing your thoughts , your wise words , and those regrets .\nYou 'll grow from them .\nI guarantee it .\n# # # Off the Wall - Read the post and bookmark Mike Rowe 's blog here .\nMike \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the vaccine .\nI \u2019 m glad .\nBut I \u2019 m also curious .\nYou have a lot of people on this page who respect your opinion - many of whom I \u2019 d wager are unvaccinated .\nHave you encouraged them to follow your example ?\nIf not , what are you waiting for ?\nAs you surely know , Delta is raging .\nThe sooner we \u2019 re all vaccinated , the sooner we can get back to normal !\nSteve Manchin Hi Steve The short answer is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get vaccinated .\nIn fact , I have recently declined to participate in several PSA 's designed to persuade people to get the jab .\nThat \u2019 s not because I \u2019 m opposed to vaccines , obviously .\nVaccines have saved more lives than any other advancement in the long history of medicine , and to your point , I got the shots the minute I was eligible .\nBut I \u2019 m not a doctor , Steve , and even though I occasionally play one on TV , I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people on this page .\nTrue , I did appear in a few PSA \u2019 s early on , back when they assured us that locking down was essential to keeping our hospitals from being overrun .\n\u201c Two weeks to flatten the curve !\n\u201d Remember that one ?\nThat of course , turned out to be untrue , and I regret my role in helping perpetuate that particular falsehood .\nI also regret what I said during the first Zoom show to air in primetime .\nIt was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I discussed the lockdowns with a few crab-boat captains .\nAt one point , I looked into the camera lens on my computer and said , with uncharacteristic earnestness , \u201c For the first time in a long time , it appears we \u2019 re all in the same boat.\n\u201d Well , I was wrong about that , too .\nWe were not in the same boat , not then or now .\nWe were in the same storm , but our boats were very different .\nSome prospered during the lockdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleasure crafts .\nOthers floundered and weathered the storm in rowboats and dinghies .\nSome had no boat at all and hung on for dear life to whatever flotsam and jetsam they could find .\nPoint is , I said some things I regret back then , and spoke too broadly to too many .\nThus , the only thing I \u2019 ll say now regarding the vaccine , is that there is risk in everything we do , and there is risk in everything we don \u2019 t do .\nThus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there is risk in not getting vaccinated .\nObviously , I made my decision , but again , I \u2019 m not a doctor .\nThus , I am not equipped to answer questions like , \u201c But Mike , if the vaccine is so safe , why hasn \u2019 t the FDA approved it ?\nOr , \u201c But Mike , if the vaccine is so effective , why is the government now treating us all as if we \u2019 re unvaccinated ?\n\u201d These are fair and reasonable questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHere in California if you \u2019 re inside , you must now wear a mask , vaccinated or not .\nWhat kind of message does that send ?\nYes , we have a new variant , and from what I \u2019 ve

person meets one of the many \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements themselves are not legal , there is no justification to have to legally exempt oneself ) , knowing they may face financially devastating

therefore , such accountability and personal responsibility are the most natural and effective motivators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , or adjusted as needed , and for harmful and ineffective decisions to be completely avoided , or never repeated .\nWe do not need elected officials legislating and dictating our health-related decisions , nor do we need public and global health officials pronouncing and

convictions of the companies who bribe , buy , influence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and medical choice freedom , paired with rock-solid parental rights .\nWhat we need is the free flow of information so that people can make fully informed decisions .\nThe censorship of anything and everything that challenges or disproves the mafia \u2019 s propaganda must be stopped .\nPerhaps most importantly , we need those who comprise the mafia described above , and their many minions , behind bars .\nWe need to be the change we want to see .\nContinued compliance will lead to increasing tyranny .\nWe need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like-minded people in your area and get involved with Dr. Pam Popper \u2019 s \u201c Make Americans Free Again \u201d and Peggy Hall \u2019 s \u201c The Healthy American \u201d

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ our little outing .\nI loved it also .\nThe only mishap that night was when Ronan got too relaxed in the kayak and dropped his foot in the water .\nHis shoe , with his custom orthotic

problems Ronan had that brought us to this exceptional doctor .\nThey existed long before Ronan landed in the ER at the children \u2019 s hospital .\nIronically , we \u2019 d had an existing appointment with his office booked for the next month , but we were blessed that we didn \u2019 t have to wait for it .\nDr. M could treat the acute problems , and he wanted to begin treating the chronic issues no one else cared to .\nWe were speechless .\nOnce we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , of course , please .\nPlease help us help our son .\nWe \u2019 ve continued to keep in touch with the lead doctor and remain comfortable with the advice Ronan \u2019 s received under his care .\nDr. M \u2019 s immediate response then , and his active involvement now , have helped keep us on a good path .\n\u2026the team of compassionate caregivers and medical staff assigned to his care exceeded our expectations .\nI lost count of how many we \u2019 d encountered , but over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted , at least 30 people personally evaluated , managed , and executed multiple tests and procedures for my son .\nThat constant , direct care helped ease our minds .\nThey collaborated and kept us informed of everything as things were happening throughout the stay .\nBest of all , they were able to determine what the major issue was that brought us to them , which meant that they could send us home with a treatment plan !\nReaders may also recall that , with the help of some quick thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better .\nI \u2019 ve never had to follow an ambulance that was transporting one of my children .\nI hope I never have to again\u2026 From The Perfect Patient December 2019 \u2026The team of nurses and doctors were quick to help alleviate one of the problems , but we all agreed that with all of Ronan \u2019 s existing medical issues and complications , we were in the wrong place .\nRonan would need to be elsewhere with a team of pediatric specialists who could evaluate and treat him .\nNot wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate Emergency Room-to-Emergency Room transfer was ordered .\nA few winters ago , Ronan landed in the ER .\nLong-time readers will remember that story and how a typical day went from bad to worse : Stopping at the doorway of the exam room and smiling toward Ronan , the GI doctor said , \u201c You look great !\nIt looks like you grew since last time we saw you here.\n\u201d As the world outside my front door becomes more and more unrecognizable , I was able to find something good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a great compliment .\nI was , too .\nWe heard these at an appointment from a specialist who \u2019 s been providing some of Ronan \u2019 s care .\nDoctors we \u2019 d approached years before brushed off all gastro problems , even though GI symptoms and simple-to-treat diagnoses were more than obvious .\nI \u2019 ll never forget the time when a much sought after specialists told me he didn \u2019 t know why Ronan was having trouble pooping .\nKids with more severe problems were receiving expert care from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 d hoped for the same , but after 2 appointments , we hit a dead end .\nAt the sink while washing his hands after examining Ronan , that doctor literally washed his hands of us when he said , \u201c It \u2019 s part of the autism .\nTalk to the autism doctor about it.\n\u201d And no , the GI doctor wouldn \u2019 t .\nThen he walked out on us .\nAfter that failed attempt , I tried working with another doctor at a large GI clinic .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attending like I \u2019 d requested but were offered an appointment with a resident .\nPromised that she would be just as professional as the \u2018 expert \u2019 , I agreed to drive the two hours to see her .\nAfter explaining as much medical history as I could and offering that Miralax , the go-to remedy at the time , did not work for my son , that doctor said she could help .\nOh , thank the Lord !\nI thought , because we really do need some help .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitedly went to a cabinet and pulled out a poster .\nOn it was an enlarged illustration of the bowels with the words MEGA COLON across the top .\nOther words , like impaction and constipation were listed also .\nGiving me what sounded like memorized textbook definition of these GI problems , I politely said to her , \u201c Yes , I know what they are , \u201d I began , \u201c and they \u2019 re exactly what I just described to you.\n\u201d \u201c OH !\n\u201d She said even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him to try Miralax.\n\u201d Baffled , I said , \u201c But I just told you he didn \u2019 t respond to that , and that we \u2019 ve tried it several times .\nIt even worsened the problem , \u201d I explained .\n\u201c Oh , \u201d the young doctor answered much less enthusiastically .\n\u201c Well , if you don \u2019 t want to use it again , I don \u2019 t have anything else I can offer you.\n\u201d I started , \u201c \u2026you guys came highly recommended .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like motility testing , and some have said you \u2019 re beginning to do things with pill cams .\nCould my son be a candidate for some further testing ?\n\u201d \u201c No .\nI can only offer you Miralax , \u201d she said .\n\u201c He \u2019 s not going on that again .\nI told you , it didn \u2019 t work , \u201d I answered as I began to pack up our things .\n\u201c Can I speak to one of the other doctors if you can \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t think so .\nThey wouldn \u2019 t do anything besides the Miralax either .\nShe told me that we \u2019 d have to try that first .\nAgain .\nEven though it didn \u2019 t work .\nI can usually recognize when an appointment heads in the wrong direction .\nI was stunned that this clinic , also highly recommended , focused on the autism and used it almost like an excuse .\n\u201c Well , it \u2019 s probably the autism that \u2019 s causing it\u2026 \u201d the young doctor began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can \u2019 t say that if you don \u2019 t bother to look deeper , \u201d and then we walked out on her .\nIt \u2019 s true that some GI issues may accompany an autism diagnosis , but those issues should be , and can be , treated independent of an autism diagnosis .\nHad that been a priority for doctors who saw Ronan after those initial disappointing encounters , things Ronan has had to deal with might not have gone from bad to worse .\nBut they did .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it .\nWhich is why we keep people like Dr. M in our back pocket .\nHe \u2019 s quick .\nHe \u2019 s helpful .\nHe \u2019 s kind .\nHe \u2019 s able to see that yes , major disabilities and other serious medical complications exists .\nBut he \u2019 s also able to see that his expertise can address , treat , and even help improve some of the GI issues that linger .\nRonan \u2019 s definitely made progress since that awful day back in 2019 .\nDr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both recalled how scary that ER encounter was .\nIt was awful .\nI was overjoyed , though , when he then said , \u201c Mom , Dad , you guys are doing great !\nFrom a nutritional standpoint , keep doing what you \u2019 re doing.\n\u201d As much as I \u2019 d like to not have to puree Ronan \u2019 s meals due to the type of GI and swallowing problems he has , we \u2019 ll keep doing that .\nHe \u2019 s still not able to eat independently nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now .\nBut we have a team who \u2019 s given us access to supplies and useful suggestions for us to try .\nAt each appointment since that really bad day , Dr. M and his team have been willing to go beyond our expectations to help us .\n\u201c Can I do anything else for you ?\nDo you need refills , for me to order anything , or sign any paperwork ?\nI can do that today , or later if you think of something\u2026 \u201d How refreshing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and to be offered more care than I expected .\nTimes are tough for so many people right now .\nThings may be tough for this doctor , but he didn \u2019 t let the outside world influence or interfere with how he treated me or my child .\nAfter we returned home , I thanked God for humans , like Dr. M , who go out of their way to build people up instead of tear them down .\nWe don \u2019 t have to go back to the clinic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look forward to seeing how much more progress Ronan can make by then .\nI \u2019 ll also look forward to being able to

would think pregnant women should be concerned .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ or about autism though .\nIt would be a concern for her personal needs and that they are not a priority for their provider .\nAs autism

is just as important , if not more , than what the doctors have been trained to say .\nIf a woman needs intervention , she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the risks are .\nI \u2019 d encourage expectant

girls and in adults .\nCase closed .\nThe number of people diagnosed with autism in England has jumped more than twentyfold in two decades , with a greater rise among females and adults , new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers say the 787 per cent rise from 1998 to 2018 , identified using the GP records of more than nine million patients , is likely due to increasing recognition and understanding of autism .\nA diagnosis of autism has become meaningless , one scientist has claimed , after the number of new cases rose by 787 per cent in two decades .\nThere has been an explosive growth in autism diagnoses in England , largely due to an increase in recognition .\nThe rise , between 1998 and 2018 , was greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest rise recorded in adult diagnosis .\nUta Frith , a neuroscientist and emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London , said the figures showed that urgent changes were needed in how the condition is diagnosed .\n\u201c It

percent in the past two decades , a new study shows , likely an effect of increasing recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater for females than males , with the greatest rises among adults .\nAdult diagnoses have been a particular feature of the rise and the University of Exeter researchers who carried out the study believe the huge increase in cases is attributable primarily to better identification .\nAutism diagnoses in England have soared nearly eight-fold in the past two decades , a study has shown .\nUK researchers said the 'explosive ' rise was likely due to increased awareness and screening for the condition .\n\u2026 Lead author of the study Ginny Russel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases in girls and adults , which suggested better identification of autism as the cause .\nSo an autism rate

months and continued to practice multiple times a week .\nOne thing they don \u2019 t tell you that is kind of annoying is that you have to keep buying lessons once you run out of all the free ones online , which happens pretty quick .\nYou are \u201c not supposed \u201d to share them unless you do it underground , meaning directly in an email to someone you know .\nThe practitioners don \u2019 t offer you any .\nThese lessons cost $ 4-8 and they can only be used once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you practice around 5 times a week .\nYou are certainly free to make your own but show me a mother with a child who has autism that can add lesson writing to her laundry list each week .\nI did notice that Reach Every Voice had a database that you can pay a flat fee to get a certain amount of lessons per month , which I was about to try out before things unraveled for us with S2C .\nThe session with her went pretty well and I was eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another practitioner in her practice .\nThe first couple sessions did not go to well as I found it very uncomfortable .\nThen I took a ride to see two other practitioners , one in Pittsburgh and another in Westchester .\nThose sessions proved to be very helpful in jumpstarting my son as they were hands down much more talented than the person we were seeing .\nBut we continued to work with the person remotely from VA each week as it just wasn \u2019 t feasible to keep driving to either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an appointment over zoom with the woman who developed S2C .\nIt is a communication method that uses a letter board in a very systematic way .\nThe practitioner will read a highly engaging lesson and then ask a series of questions depending on the level of the child .\nThen the student will spell the word or sentence as their answer with a communication partner \u2019 s help holding the letter board for them .\nThis can be very helpful for those with motor difficulties especially dyspraxia .\nI had read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : An Autism Miracle \u201d a couple weeks before it came out , as he sent me an advanced copy before our podcast interview .\nHere is the interview with JB and his son Jamie about his incredible experience .\nLike many people I could barely wait until the morning to call a practitioner to sign us up for this new and innovative therapy .\nI thought `` this could be just the thing we need '' .\nMy son already spoke but there was no initiation of language .\nThis means he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not initiate language on his own .\nIt \u2019 s hard to form relationships and make friends without the initiation part .\nSo I was beyond excited to give it a whirl .\nI couldn \u2019 t decide whether or not to be silent about what happened to my son .\nAnd then it dawned on me how unfair it would be if I didn \u2019 t share my story .\nAs most of us know in the autism community it is easier to stay quiet , fly under the radar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flack from some people that comes when you speak out about an injustice .\nA couple months ago I noticed that my son was using a lot more speech in his lessons .\nHe would answer the questions verbally instead of using the letter board .\nNow you can imagine just how excited this made me .\nThings were finally paying off I thought .\nBut much to my surprise his S2C practitioner did not share the same enthusiasm as me .\nIn fact , she blew it off and ignored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only that , she pretty much discouraged his speech by ignoring that he said the answer and told me to have him spell it anyway .\nI stopped her and we spoke about it for 5-10 minutes .\nShe kept saying that he just needed to get better at the letter board and I kept insisting this is every parents dream to hear them answer questions verbally on their own .\nThis is what we are coming here for .\nIt was obvious she did not agree .\nSo I dropped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get another opinion that counted .\nI reached out to my son \u2019 s Speech Therapist to get some sound reasoning .\nAndrew has been around the block .\nI believe he has been a speech pathologist for over 40 years .\nHe is very familiar with letter boarding and one of those very special therapists who actually presumes competence .\nHe knows my son is incredibly intelligent and cringed when I told him a tutor last year asked my son what color shirt he was wearing .\nSo I relayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his S2C practitioner .\nHe was quiet as he took it all in .\nI could tell that he wanted to be careful how he dealt with this .\nAndrew is special in that he has seen letter boarding back in the 70 \u2019 s when they did it in institutions .\nHe has also recently seen a few young adults go on to college successfully using a keyboard .\nFinally he could not hold back and let me know that what she is doing is wrong .\nDylan gave the answer verbally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell it like he did something wrong .\nHe felt that Dylan must have thought he did something wrong when he was made to spell it afterwards .\nAfter all wasn \u2019 t what he did the end game or should have been .\nAndrew and I left off that Dylan \u2019 s verbal answer needs to be accepted period .\nI brought up my conversation with Andrew in my next session with I \u2019 ll call her Kara for amnonmity .\nBasically Kara blew me off and said this is how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better at letter boarding .\nHer answer and excuses did not sit well with me but I did not want to continue to use the session to argue with her in front of my son .\nWell not shocking Dylan stopped giving the answers verbally .\nWhy would he when they were not being accepted anyway .\nThis pissed me off to put it lightly .\nI was trying to decide if Kara was inexperienced or not too bright .\nLife kept me busy over the next few weeks as the new school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get my daughter everything she needed for Middle School and gear up for Dylan \u2019 s sophomore year of Homeschooling .\nThen one day I saw a post on Facebook from another mom doing S2C who \u2019 s child was going to college and I immediately reached out to her .\nI wanted to find out all about her success .\nWe got on the phone and had a really nice pow wow .\nShe told me about these great online classes for spellers .\nI thought it would be a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I signed up right away for two classes .\nWe took Ancient Civilizations and Cultural Literature .\nI think I loved them more then Dylan .\nThe greatest thing about Homeschooling isn \u2019 t just that I get to teach my son all the things his other schools refused to believe he could learn but that I get to relearn everything with a brain that actually works because it is not on gluten .\nThese group classes were set up similar to his individual spelling class in that she reads us a paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students a few questions to answer .\nThe spelling partner types the child \u2019 s answer in the chat area .\nWell during this first class to my surprise Dylan preferred to answer verbally once again and did so for the entire class .\nIt was interesting that away from Kara this was his immediate reaction to speak .\nI listened to his speech therapist and honored every answer and did NOT make him spell it afterwards .\nHe did the same thing in the next class we took .\nBut when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverted back to only spelling again .\nTHIS WAS GETTING INTERESTING TO ME !\nSo here I was with no choice but to speak with her again .\nAnd lo and behold she had the same reaction as the first time .\nBut I told her that her answer wasn \u2019 t good enough and she had to speak with her boss ( who developed the technique ) .\nAbout two days later I received this email below from her .\nI thought it was important to share as she admitted to discouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their goal .\nShe also makes the very big mistake in telling me that it is unlikely my son will ever use verbal speech as his primary mode of communication .\ni have highlighted the important areas for you to read .\nThe goal of S2C is to provide our students with a reliable , robust , effective means of communication .\nSpeech may be a happy byproduct of this practice due to the increased neural pathways between speech and language , however it is not our goal .\nOf course I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable speech , as am I when our students start to gain more control over their motor and their bodies in any way , it will allow him to get some ideas across to people who are not skilled on the board , and that 's great !\nMy goal is to increase his communication .\nLong term , it is possible to continue to see an increase in speech , however it is very unlikely that speech will be able to be his primary mode of communication .\nThat being said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on his speech in therapy .\nIn our sessions we are working on the purposeful motor of pointing to letters on the boards in order to increase accuracy at each level .\nI confirmed with EV that she too , when a speller in the acquisition phase uses their voice to answer a question , has them spell it , just for practice .\n`` Now let 's use your arm !\n\u201d My suggestion is to reframe spelling ( with or without speech preceding it ) from a punishment , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will lead to more effective communication , regardless of through what means .\nAt some point with our mega fluent spellers , when they do answer with their voice we will move on , not making them respell the word , however it 's necessary to put in the practice to reach that point first .\nInitially , when working with a speller , we actually discourage them from using their speech while they are spelling , because focusing on the motor of pointing to letters while trying to speak is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI was very clear about my reason and intentions for venturing into S2C .\nI wanted to increase my son \u2019 s verbal initiation of language .\nWhy the hell did they take my money for six months and not mention that we would not be focusing on it .\nEven worse , they when he used it .\nThis I found reprehensible .\nNext she decides she is a prophet and knows what my son will do or not do in the future as far as communication .\nFortunately for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that experienced but not so bright either .\nNeedless to say I still had such a visceral response to her email .\nI was so angry I had shooting pains down my arm from my neck that I get with unexpressed anger .\nBut I tempered myself and wrote her a couple emails explaining how upset I was by the choice of words in her email .\nNo response came .\nI left a message for the owner of the center and got no response .\nI called again the next day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my calls would not stop .\nShe finally returned my call .\nThe conversation was useless and she was devoid of any emotion , which I told her was adding insult to injury .\nI got an insincere apology .\nI knew it was time to cut bait and that this was a waste of my energy .\nWe left off that I wanted a written apology from Kara and that I would not be paying my remaining balance for traumatizing me .\nI slowly released some of my anger with another email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a passive aggressive apology .\nThis was a first for me in an email .\nMy husband who is a glass is half full person when it comes to dealing with people said \u201c oh that \u2019 s passive aggressive \u201d .\nSo I decided it was time to let it go and move on .\nI can \u2019 t tell you why it hurt so deeply .\nIs it because it reminds me that the people who were supposed to help and protect him ended up hurting him so profoundly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all unfold in slow motion .\nWas it because I spent so much time , money and energy for them to act so callously and not have his best interest at heart .\nOr that they were more concerned about their therapy being done the `` right way '' than what was best for him .\nI am not sure but I am better now that it has been a few days .\nI will continue to sort out the emotional part in the weeks to come .\nMy freak out moment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying or yelling about it anytime soon .\nI will do what I have done for 15 years - I will get up , dust myself off and step forward .\nWe will continue to work on his initiation of language .\nMy son has great print and cursive penmanship .\nWe do all kinds of creative writing to help put his thoughts on paper .\nHis OT has him texting and emailing during sessions to use the keyboard , which he types well on .\nSo I don \u2019 t know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s hard to go work with another practitioner when I know they all receive the same training from the woman who developed it and will be taught the same as Kara .\nMy belief is she needs to be more upfront to parents about her communication program when it comes to those who already have verbal language or come up with a way to handle a child that is becoming more verbal in the sessions .\nIt is great that the communication tool is easily accessible to all parents but it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s needs like any therapy tool .\nIf a surgeon opened up a person and found something unexpected , but continued to do the surgery the way they always performed it , then that patient might not have the best outcome then if they adapted to the individual situation .\nS2C feels a lot like ABA but not in a good way .\nMy experience is not meant to dissuade anyone from doing S2C .\nI am elated for all the children and adults it has helped and will continue to .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person who previously could not communicate has now found a way to get their voice heard .\nI encourage everyone to look into it and read JB Handley \u2019 s book .\nBut on the other hand there is nothing more devastating than to have a child who is trying to communicate and to have their voice ignored or squashed while I am paying for a therapy meant to increase his communication .\nI am haunted today when I reread the highlighted portions of her email .\nI was going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could help and then I realized I had to make people aware of it \u2019 s pitfalls so another child or parent was not hurt in the same way we speak out about other injustice \u2019 s .\nDara Berger is the author of the book \u201c How to Prevent Autism \u201d .\nShe hosts a podcast titled Every Choice Counts

Collins in February of 2020 .\nCollins ' leaves autism in far worse shape than he found it .\nThe mark of a very poor leader , unless he was simply following orders .\nWe 'll share our posts about him over the weekend to help readers fully understand the depth of his impotence .\nBy John Stone In a short article in Southern Maryland Chronicle a few days ago the Head of the National Institutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest autism gene study under the title 'Largest-Ever Genetic Study of Autism Yields New Insights ' .\nPerhaps the message here is that in order to fight crime the government has decided to investigate the victims not the perpetrators ( actually it has been doing this for three decades ) .\nIn 2006 as Head of the Human Genome Project Collins told Congress : '' But genes alone do not tell the whole story .\nRecent increases in chronic diseases like diabetes , childhood asthma , obesity or autism can not be due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool as those changes take much more time to occur .\nThey must be due to changes in the environment , including diet and physical activity , which may produce disease in genetically predisposed persons .\nTherefore , GEI ( the Genes and Environment Initiative ) will also invest in innovative new technologies/sensors to measure environmental toxins , dietary intake and physical activity , and using new tools of genomics , proteomics , and understanding metabolism rates to determine an individual 's biological response to those influences . ''\nReferences on-line to GEI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( perhaps they were in danger of finding something ) .\nSo , 14 years ago Collins warned that there would be no material result from this kind of research and it is what the government have been doing ever since , more or less as an employment scheme ( typically , the new study boasts nearly two hundred authors ) .\nAs Eisenhower said to no avail in his farewell speech six decades ago : '' Today , the solitary inventor , tinkering in his shop , has been overshadowed by task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields .\nIn the same fashion , the free university , historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery , has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research .\nPartly because of the huge costs involved , a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity ... . ''\nThe prospect of domination of the nation 's scholars by Federal employment , project allocations , and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded .\n`` Yet , in holding scientific research and discovery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific/ technological elite . ''\nNow - with whatever insights their may be into gene risk association or even patterns of damage - is that all the NIH have really succeeded in doing is generating a lot more data : the new study is not only `` the largest ever '' it is `` the largest-ever '' in NIH speak ( and with a huge cast ) , but in terms of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer discovering what is driving the autism epidemic , just as Collins told Congress it would not all those years ago : it is all one giant step for mankind to nowhere .\nMeanwhile , the autism rate in schools is perhaps 4 or 5 times higher than it was then : it is rather hard to tell because NIH and CDC have failed to monitor it in any systematic way .\nWhen I started out on this trail I recall a meeting at a freezing local church hall in early 1997 addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESPA Autism Research Unit , Sunderland .\nOne of the many and terrible things Paul told us was that 90 % off the funding into the causes of autism was being swallowed by useless gene research , meanwhile the problem was ten times as bad as ten years before .\nHe foretold exactly was going to play out .\nHow appalling and cynical this charade has been .\nIf you want to turn a disaster into a catastrophe and catastrophe into a cataclysm send for Collins !\n!\n!\nJohn Stone is UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/668971086/0/ageofautism.html", "published": "2021-10-07T07:20:32-04:00", "published_utc": 1633605632, "collection_utc": 1633644051}, {"id": "ageofautism--2021-10-08--Nonspeaking Autism & Vision: A National Autism Association WebiNAAr", "date": "2021-10-08", "source": "ageofautism", "title": "Nonspeaking Autism & Vision: A National Autism Association WebiNAAr", "content": "No matter what avenues , treatments , therapies , education models , medical treatments , behavioral programs we pursue , the one thing , maybe the only thing , that has ever united the disparate autism community is a desire to help our kids .\nFrom our friends at NAA .\n# # # Is nonspeaking autism a cognitive disorder , or could it actually be a motor skill difference ?\nHave nonspeaking kids been inaccurately diagnosed with an intellectual disability just because they do n't have the fine motor skills necessary to speak ?\nJoin us on Monday for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autism .\nOur first two webiNAArs have been viewed by thousands of people via Zoom and Facebook .\n( Replays are available on our Facebook page under Videos or the Autism ATRIUM section of our website . )\nIn our next session , we 'll chat with Dr. Dana Johnson about Ocular Motor Control and Apraxia -

yet the CDC and the industry that controls it still enjoy a carte blanche that truly boggles the mind .\nIronically , the only organized political grouping that openly agrees with what I 've been saying are precisely those champions of the far right whose primary mission remains the dismantling of the government 's public-interest functions , and whose predecessors were the ones who made the present corruption possible , while Fox News and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where any criticism of the CDC and the vaccine mandates is tolerated , and Democratic Congressmen like Adam Schiff have directed social media to remove as `` disinformation '' any criticism of vaccines or official policy regarding them .\nThe main constituency that I feel impelled to speak for are the thousands upon thousands of aggrieved parents whom I spoke of earlier , who now look by default to the GOP as their only hope of deliverance , and may well have rendered Gov .\nNewsom 's recent recall election , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been without them .\nAs I see it , that allegiance is a huge and terrible mistake .\nThe GOP continues to attack the CDC just as it has in the past , not because it 's giving the drug industry a free ride , but simply because it exists , as a government agency , and thus ultimately because of what it should be doing , protecting the general public from the greed of the industry .\nSo they will attack it even harder , and end up betraying those same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Democrats can help it do its job of protecting them .\nThe apparent coincidence of the pandemic , and the urgencies arising from Trump 's and the CDC 's mishandling of it , have inevitably sharpened these same dichotomies to a fever pitch , by providing the perfect opportunity for both the industry and the CDC to achieve their long-standing agenda of universal vaccination by coercing virtually the entire population into compliance , running roughshod over our right of informed consent , and thus endangering us all , not least those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuinely protected by it for the time being .\nAs a physician with progressive values , I keep asking myself what I and others of like mind can do to revive the CDC and hold it to its original mission , of caring for the injured , restraining a runaway industry , restoring our right to informed consent , and speaking out for good science and good health , at a time when those I most need and want to convince are desirous of even stricter mandates and thus apt to dismiss us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` anti-vaxxers '' who think only of ourselves .\nIn short , by some sort of truth-telling that has so far proved ineffective , we need to show the Democrats in positions of power -- our legislators , governors , mayors , District Attorneys , Attorneys General , judges , doctors , nurses , business leaders , and NGO 's like the ACLU , the Brennan Center , and so forth -- that the science being invoked to support the mandates is junk science , designed to inflate a significant outbreak into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as us , and ultimately serves no long-term interest but the bottom line of an industry that is already obscenely wealthy and threatens to keep us all under their thumb for the foreseeable future .\nThat miracle will not be achieved by arguing ; I 've already learned that the hard way .\nWhenever I try to discuss the issue with people whose political beliefs and values are similar to mine , they typically agree with Bernie that the drug industry is corrupt .\nBut when it comes to vaccination , even those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , or have succeeded in reducing the total number and frequency of vaccines that their kids receive , are sufficiently frightened by the COVID to welcome the official assurance that the available vaccines will at least minimize the risk of serious illness and death , as they do seem to be doing , and even agree that the unvaccinated are mainly responsible for spreading the virus , preventing herd immunity , and thus ending the emergency .\nNor can I blame them , for the lay public is has every right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scientists in a position to know the truth are giving it to us straight .\nSo , once again , their blind spot is failing to see or refusing to acknowledge that the industry is controlling and corrupting the CDC .\nLike most people , the Democrats see it , alas all too accurately , as a polarizing political issue , simply because the GOP is united in proclaiming the opposite , and thus refuse even to entertain the possibility that what at least the more politically aware of them must fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the agency is largely bankrolled and almost entirely controlled by the drug industry , whose greatest profit center has long been the mandating of vaccines ; that the companies that manufacture vaccines have repeatedly been found guilty of deceiving the public ; and that the very real threat of the virus has been manipulated to heighten the uncertainty and fear that we naturally all feel .\nSo the question becomes , how can we help our families , friends , and neighbors acknowledge , accept , and ultimately act upon the unpalatable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already be preparing for ?\nIt should n't be that difficult , because the other major industries in our economy have long since bought and corrupted the government agencies that were set over them in much the same way .\nThe only difference is that vaccines are uniquely revered with all the fervor of born-again religion , such that the companies who make them are now excused from all financial and legal responsibility for whatever harm they cause .\nThis , then , is my dilemma ;

doing nothing for so many weeks , it allowed the President to have his way , until the surge in new cases threatened to overwhelm the capacity of hospitals and clinics to care for them , making containment of the outbreak seem impossible , and thus appearing to necessitate `` flattening the curve , '' by means of a generalized lockdown and shutdown of the economy , even though these measures would necessarily prolong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergence of mutant strains as well .\nSo whatever the reason for it , even if they were genuinely unnerved and uncertain , their prolonged hesitation has brought about a disaster of epic proportions , not to mention the fact that , if Trump 's blustering , bullying , and threats of retaliation had actually cowed them into submission , their timidity would be even harder to forgive .\nIn any case , by far the simplest explanation , which would also help explain why their response continues to be half-hearted and chaotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership actually wanted and indeed planned for the event to evolve in that way , because they had already decided to invest their time , money , and energy in developing and promoting a new vaccine against the virus , which had long since become their default strategy for dealing with infectious diseases of every kind .\nGiven the official line , and the censoring of all competing versions , this conjecture would already qualify as a `` conspiracy theory '' of sorts ; but what gives it a lot more credence than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC officials actively participated in an elaborate wargame-simulation exercise in October , 2019 , that envisioned and indeed actively planned for a coronavirus pandemic uncannily like the one we are now living through , just two months before the first cases were announced to the world.6 Organized jointly by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security , the World Economic Forum , and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the so-called `` Event 201 '' invited legislators , corporate executives , health policy makers , and representatives of the news and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global crisis involving millions of deaths and a massive economic shutdown lasting 18 months , until either an effective vaccine became available , or 80-90 % of the world 's population had already been exposed and thus developed a robust , natural , `` herd '' immunity , whichever came first , although flattening the curve and thus prolonging the outbreak was rapidly pre-empting the second possibility.7 In late January , just three weeks after the first cases appeared in China , the World Economic Forum duly announced its own COVID Action Platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , followed a few days later by the WHO declaring a Public Health Emergency , signing on to precisely the same 18-month scenario that the organizers of Event 201 had already mapped out.8 Simply by waiting and doing nothing further to arrest or contain it , the CDC 's subsequent actions for flattening the curve , above all locking down homes and businesses and outlawing large public and private gatherings , came to be perceived by the general public as the most prudent course of action , even though it would necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goes with it , as well as giving ample time for mutant strains to develop , and thus making further waves of COVID-19 much more likely , so that the mounting fears of most people became entirely reasonable , whether deliberately planned for or not .\nIn a 2020 interview , the well-known author and activist Naomi Klein seized upon the pandemic as a perfect illustration of `` disaster capitalism , '' a term she coined in her 2007 book , The Shock Doctrine : the Rise of Disaster Capitalism : Disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit from large-scale crises .\nDisaster and war profiteering really deepened under the Bush administration after 9/11 , when the administration declared this sort of never- ending security crisis , and simultaneously privatized it and outsourced it\u2014this included the domestic , privatized security state , as well as the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan .\nThe \u201c shock doctrine \u201d is the political strategy of using large-scale crises to push through policies that systematically deepen inequality , enrich elites , and under- cut everyone else .\nIn moments of crisis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergencies of surviving that crisis , whatever it is , and tend to put too much trust in those in power .\nWe take our eyes off the ball in moments of crisis .\nThe shock is the virus , [ and its being ] managed in a way that is maximizing confusion and minimizing protection .\nI don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s a conspiracy , it \u2019 s just the way the U.S. government [ has ] utterly mismanaged the crisis .\nIt \u2019 s the worst- case scenario , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn \u2019 t have a national health care program , and its protections for workers are abysmal.9 In any case , flattening the curve and locking down quickly became the official narrative of what was happening , such that natural herd immunity seemed increasingly impossible , and indeed actually undesirable , as Dr. Fauci was quick to point out , since those who achieved it might no longer want or seem to need a vaccine.10 The crowning irony , then , no matter how often and how vehemently Trump vented his spleen against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` Deep State '' they allegedly represent , is that the ex-President 's debunking inaction , echoed by that of the party he still holds captive despite losing the election , was actually a giant step toward fulfilling the very agenda he claimed to despise , not to mention letting Fauci and the CDC off the hook , and indeed widely celebrated as the true voices of reason , science , and public health .\nGiven the enormous but still imprecisely known number of asymptomatic cases and others still unidentified , the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much lower than the calculated ratio of confirmed to fatal cases .\nWe know that the vast majority of even confirmed cases recover , and that even larger numbers contract and recover from the infection without bothering to see a doctor , getting tested , or indeed feeling sick in any way.11 But two highly unusual properties of the virus have amplified not only the panic and uncertainty surrounding it , but also the global reach of the COVID illness linked to it , into what has become a truly worldwide menace that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic status .\nThe first is the unprecedentedly large percentage of asymptomatic or very mild infections , aggravated by our tardiness , indifference , and failure to locate and identify them both early and widely enough , as we saw , which has generated a crippling fear and uncertainty about the actual trajectory of the outbreak and where on its curve we happen to be situated at any given moment .\nThe second , which relates directly to the vaccine scenario , is its extraordinary mutability , as indicated by recurrent , cyclical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reported cases , followed by equally dramatic surges of new cases in various parts of the world associated with new mutant variants.12,13 In 2021 , with the advent of mass vaccination , several of these have already created new surges in reported cases,14 with every likelihood that the vaccines will actually accelerate these mutations,15,16 if indeed they have n't already done so .\nAs with the influenza vaccines , but perhaps even more so , this genetic instability will probably limit the effectiveness of vaccines developed against a particular strain to relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry , the CDC , and the WHO to develop new ones at least every year , if not oftener .\nSo we have every reason to expect that not just one new vaccine , but almost certainly a whole battery of them , are coming our way with all possible speed , and that our dithering with the outbreak , protecting the children from getting sick , and our massive vaccination program will all keep the virus around for much longer than the year and a half that it has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , independent scientists have identified a number of different ways in which the case numbers and deaths have been inflated in America and elsewhere , casting serious doubt on the high death rates reported in the official statistics , and thus discrediting the CDC narrative that adds to that fear and spreads it far and wide .\nTo begin with , the unprecedentedly high number of asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic cases strongly indicate that there are many , many more cases of infection and many , many fewer deaths legitimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far , and that this discrepancy will very likely continue , even when the pandemic begins to recede , as more and more people are tested .\nIn an attempt to determine the true incidence of cases , including those infected or in contact with the virus but showing few or no symptoms , one survey designed by Prof. John Ioannidis of Stanford tested all residents of Santa Clara County , California for specific antibodies , and found them at a rate of 50 to 85 times higher than the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general population would bring the actual death rate down to the same range as the typical seasonal flu , in the neighborhood of 0.12 to 0.2 % of those infected.17 In addition , the data from almost everywhere indicate that the vast majority of deaths occur among the ranks of the elderly , infirm , and chronically ill ; and in most American hospitals , cities , and states , patients who tested positive but died from their significant comorbidities were nevertheless signed off as having died from rather than simply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still further exaggerated by the extra compensation that hospitals receive for their COVID-19 cases , with even larger awards for their deaths , potent incentives for padding their statistics with even `` probable '' cases that were never confirmed by test.20 Another source of inaccuracy is the test that the case numbers are based on , the Polymerase Chain Reaction or PCR , which is designed to detect coronavirus RNA fragments rather than live virus , and is thereby subject to numerous false positives , and thus to further manipulations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Kary Mullis , who invented the test and was awarded a Nobel Prize for it in 1993 , warned early on against using it to diagnose infectious diseases.23 An especially troubling feature of the CDC agenda was its `` warp-speed '' program for fast-tracking the development of new vaccines , which has allowed the firms involved in the competition to skip the time-consuming but critical step of animal testing and proceed immediately to human trials , an omission that will inevitably and gravely jeopardize both their safety and effectiveness .\nJaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will doubtless find grim amusement in the newfound scruples of Dr. Peter Hotez and Dr. Paul Offit , darlings of the industry who almost never meet a vaccine they do n't like , suddenly arguing against fast-tracking these futuristic vaccines without large-scale studies to prove their efficacy,24 or animal testing to insure their safety,25 belated pangs of conscience long overdue , to put it mildly .\nSo here we are , more than 330 million of us in this country alone , marooned in Dr. Fauci 's overcrowded lifeboat , with still no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment recommended or made widely available when we do get sick , except anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs of admittedly limited effectiveness , while several other promising pharmaceuticals are ignored , discredited , or set aside , and natural medicines of proven worth , like herbs , vitamins , nutritional supplements , and homeopathics , are scornfully dismissed as old-fashioned and of no value .\nThe CDC has developed and matured its staunchly and almost exclusively pro-vaccine agenda over a period of many decades

Depression , and was carried out by a professional civil service , recruited mainly from the biological sciences and medicine .\nSince the 1970 's , when the radical right gained control of the Republican Party , one of its main purposes has been to roll back these achievements by defunding the Federal bureaucracy and downsizing its career civil service , especially those agencies assisting the most vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick and handicapped , as well as infants and children -- and thereby neglecting its functions of insuring occupational safety , and of protecting the air , water , soil , and food supply from toxins , pollutants , and other hazardous by-products of industry.26 The CDC , FDA , and NIH , the main Federal agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services , have survived these cuts by accepting huge infusions of cash from the drug industry and super-wealthy private donors , and by approving and promoting their products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time-honored and labor-intensive public health priorities , like hiring boots on the ground to test air , water , food , and soil and trace the spread of epidemic diseases , they have come to rely more and more on drugs , chemicals , and above all vaccines , as their magic wand for warding off infectious diseases of every kind .\nIn 2003 , as a UPI reporter summarized it , The CDC is in the vaccine business .\nUnder a 1980 law , it has 28 licensing agreements with companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its Advisory Committee get money from manufacturers by sharing their patents , owning their stock , performing their research , monitoring their tests , and funding the academic departments to which they belong .\nThis situation , while legal , gives reason to worry that vaccine side-effects are worse than CDC officials say.27 A 2013 press release from the industry website listed 270 new vaccines already in the pipeline at various stages of the clinical trial process or under FDA review.28 The manufacturers achieved their ultimate victory in 1986 , after parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damages in court , and pressured Congress to establish a Federal mechanism for identifying vaccine injuries in children and compensating them swiftly and generously without requiring a lengthy trial.29 At the last minute the industry threatened to stop making vaccines entirely unless the law shielded them from financial liability in the future , a free ride granted to no other industry ; 30 and Congress gave in , accepting the industry 's minimal list of compensable reactions as their own , and setting up a Federal mechanism for compensating victims that is heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of them succeed.31 In 2011 , the Supreme Court upheld the law , on the basis that vaccines are `` unavoidably unsafe , '' in Justice Scalia 's memorable phrasing , as if worthy of and hence forever in need of such protection.32 Thus freed from all damage claims , the manufacturers now have carte blanche to manufacture vaccines against any diseases or infirmities they wish , often for no better reason than that they have the technical capacity to do so , with the CDC and the FDA all but guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread veneration that vaccines have continued to inspire in the general public and the medical profession , the CDC has completed its transformation from an independent agency protecting the public interest into the head cheerleader for the pharmaceutical industry it was supposed to be regulating , while still going through the motions of its original purpose .\nIts secret for keeping up that pretense lies in its impossibly strict standards for vaccine injuries , which are identical to those vanishingly few listed in the safety trials of the manufacturers , and make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placebo controls of unvaccinated persons , rejecting adverse events occurring more than a week or two after the shot , as well as those not already approved on the list , and giving the lead investigator absolute authority to disallow reported injuries for any reason at all.33 The inevitable result has been a massive underreporting of chronic diseases , acute injuries , and deaths occasioned by vaccines , estimated by a former head of the FDA to be only 1 % of the actual figure,34 which has helped to convince the general public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these products are ideally safe , and that it is therefore entirely permissible and indeed desirable to pile on as many as we want , and to give them as often as we like,35 despite ample scientific research to the contrary , and candid revelations of malfeasance from agency and industry insiders .\nIn 2014 , a senior CDC scientist issued a formal apology that agency higher-ups had suppressed experimental data proving that the MMR frequently caused autism : I regret that my co-authors and I omitted significant information in our 2004 article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the MMR before 36 months were at increased risk of autism.36 In a documentary on the HPV vaccine , a former Vice-President of Pfizer all but boasted of his strong-arm tactics to promote their products , in flagrant violation of the ethical standards that Pfizer still subscribes to , which nevertheless remain standard practice throughout the industry : Universities and health organizations are begging for money .\nThe only ones who have money are the big corporations , and they have lots of it .\nThey give grants for research , pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make profits for their products .\nSafety trials are supposedly third-party and independent , but the money wo n't keep coming unless they say what you want them to say .\nEverybody knows this is how things work .\nOnly the public does n't know it.37 The industry has added more and more vaccines to the recommended list,38 together with their steadfast insistence , seconded by the CDC and most of the medical profession , that the skyrocketing prevalence of chronic diseases , and the ever-increasing number and variety of adverse reactions being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their doctors , have nothing to do with them.39 Even before COVID , the vaccine manufacturers launched a global campaign for maximizing vaccination rates everywhere , backed by WHO and funded by many of the same wealthy donors who back the CDC.40 In the United States , they persuaded several blue states to propose laws eliminating non-medical exemptions entirely , some of which were enacted .\nIn Europe , they convinced the EU and several member countries to propose sweeping new mandates and to enforce them by making passports and drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to massive street demonstrations in France , Italy , and elsewhere to protest them,42 along with the hi-tech control of personal data that such surveillance would require .\nAppearing as if coincidentally in the thick of these efforts , the COVID pandemic , whatever may have caused it , has provided the drug industry and its obscenely wealthy benefactors the perfect opportunity to upstage their critics and achieve their ultimate goals , as grandly set forth in the WHO Prospectus : Immunization is a global health success story , saving millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation of primary health care , an indisputable human right , and one of the best investments that money can buy .\nWith the support of countries and partners , WHO is leading the creation of a new global strategy for the next decade .\nIt envisions a world in which everyone , everywhere , and at every age fully benefits from vaccination to improve health and well-being.43 By branding the COVID a pandemic , the CDC , the WHO , the vaccine industry , and their mega-rich donors have cultivated an atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by prolonging the economic shutdown , opposing effective treatments for the illness , and thus helping to bring about the conditions for the general public in most of the world to long for a vaccine as their only hope of escaping from the crisis and returning to a semblance of the life they were forced to leave behind .\nAlthough coronaviruses had been known and studied for decades , the SARS epidemic of 2002-03 , a zo\u00f6nosis originating in bats , became the starting-point for accelerated investigations of them at military and non-military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Army bioweapons facility in Maryland subjected them to bioengineering `` gain-of-function '' research , to make them even more contagious and virulent than the wild types , up to and including the hypothetical capacity to unleash global pandemics.45 In 2011 , many scientists voiced deep misgivings about the risk of such `` superbugs '' escaping from their laboratory environments and infecting the general public.46 Three years later , when a few such leaks were reported to have occurred from a CDC facility,47 the Obama Administration finally declared a halt to all gain-of-function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump was inaugurated , the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease , a division of NIH headed by Dr. Fauci , gave a grant of $ 3.7 million to the Chinese government lab in Wuhan to resume them.49 In 2020 , Trump belatedly terminated them to try to escape responsibility for his part in the pandemic , shifting the blame to China , home of the first known case , and President Obama , his b\u00eate noire of record , falsely insisting that the grant had been his idea.50 It also came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while bearing the name of the NIH , were actually being paid out and administered by a consortium of universities and private companies known as the EcoHealth Alliance , just one of an extensive network of similar public-private partnerships of which the public was largely unaware.51 The labyrinthine auspices of these partnerships raised troubling ethical questions as to who actually owns and profits from the drugs and vaccines developed under their auspices.52 In addition , they enable super-rich investors to write off their contributions as charitable donations , while profiting vaccine manufacturers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily invested in , a thus far entirely legal `` new philanthropy '' that generates huge profits , outsize influence , and a cachet of respectability because of the seemingly worthy causes they so righteously support.53 In any case , it is clear that the United States military and scientific communities have been actively studying , designing , and manufacturing ever-deadlier coronaviruses for quite a long time .\nThe program was in full swing from 2004 until 2014 , when President Obama brought it to a halt , only to be revived shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's term in office , until shortly before the 2020 election , when the COVID was at its height , this time with funding provided by NIH grantees to China 's Wuhan lab , under Dr. Fauci 's sponsorship .\nFor that reason alone , the additional facts \u2022 that the virus outstrips all others we know of in the percentage of infected people who are asymptomatic or only mildly ill , \u2022 that it selectively kills and cripples those who are already chronically ill , \u2022 that it appears to be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and \u2022 that it has brought about a rapid and eerily fatal termination in some patient that is still not completely understood , all make it appear highly probable \u2022 that it was manufactured in the Wuhan lab , to a great extent with our help , if not at our behest , \u2022 that it escaped , presumably by just the sort of accident that our scientists have long been worried about , and \u2022 that the program had succeeded brilliantly in accomplishing precisely what its paymasters had in mind \u2022 what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wuhan was a disaster waiting to happen , if not now , then at some future time \u2022 Trump and his cronies bear major responsibility for it , as do Dr. Fauci and the CDC , however much they keep blaming each other ; \u2022 and the strategy of flattening the curve and locking down until the vaccine comes to the rescue , regardless of precisely when it was devised and settled on , has brought about a national and global catastrophe far more grievous than any-thing that the virus , bioengineered or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own .\nAs far as I 'm aware , nobody is openly congratulating our soldiers , scientists , and philanthropists for a job well done ; but we need to make it clear to them and everyone else that it 's a job we need to stop doing once and for all , since the morbidity and mortality that the COVID has already caused are only the beginning of the dire threat it continues to pose to everyone on the planet .\nIn any case , the fact that advocates of mass vaccination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years , and even staged the infamous Event 201 to plan for it , only adds further weight to the suspicion of some scientists that the outbreak actually began months earlier , in the late summer or fall of 2019 , such that at least the organizers of Event 201 were already aware of it .\nBut whether or not the CDC was forewarned , \u2022 Holshue , M. , et al.\n, `` First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States , '' \u2022 Cf.\n, for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transmission in Cluster of COVID-19 \u2022 Cf.\n, for example , Woodward , A. , `` The life and rise of Dr. Anthony Fauci , the public-health hero who has become the face of America 's Coronavirus response \u2022 Cf .\nChen , C. , et al.\n, `` Key Missteps at the CDC Have Set Back Its Ability to Detect the Potential Spread of the Coronavirus , '' ProPublica , , February \u2022 Cf.\n, for example , `` Perspectives on the Pandemic II : a Conversation with Dr. Knut Wittkowski , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , April 2 , \u2022 Prof. Mary Holland , `` What We Can Learn from a Pandemic `` Tabletop Exercise , '' \u2022 Cf .\nNaomi Klein , `` Coronavirus is the Perfect Disaster for Disaster Capitalism , '' \u2022 Cf .\nWeise , E. , `` 8 strains of the coronavirus are circling the globe .\nHere 's what \u2022 Cf.\n, for example , Mercola , J. , `` New Delta Virus Variant Escalates Lockdowns , '' \u2022 Richard Harris , `` COVID-19 Vaccines Could Add Fuel to Evolution of Corona- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , `` SARS-CoV-2 Variants and Vaccines , '' Special Report , New \u2022 Rogers , M. , `` Fact Check : Hospitals get paid more if patients listed as COVID- \u2022 `` Coronavirus : the Truth about the PCR Test Kit from the Inventor and Other \u2022 Johnson , C. , `` Inside the extraordinary race to invent a coronavirus vaccine , '' \u2022 This powerful , oligarchic movement , reversing FDR 's New Deal , and promoting laissez-faire capitalism , the free market , and the doctrine of states ' rights that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antebellum south , is skillfully told and thoroughly documented in MacLean , N. , Democracy in Chains : the Deep History of the Radical Right 's Stealth Plan for America , Penguin , 2017 .\n\u2022 Holland , `` Liability for Vaccine Injury : the United States , Europe , and the \u2022 Holland , 2011 , op .\ncit.\n, and with Robert Krakow , Esq.\n, `` The Right to Legal Redress , '' in The Vaccine Epidemic , Skyhorse , New York , 2011 , pp .\n39-40 .\nMedication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the AMA 269:2765 , June \u2022 Cf.\n, for example , `` History of Vaccine Safety , '' CDC , \u2022 `` Statement of William Thompson , Ph .\nD. , Regarding the 2004 Article Examining the Possibility of a Relationship between the MMR Vaccine and Autism , '' Press Release , Morgan Verkamp LLC , August 27 , 2014 .\n\u2022 Interview with Dr. Peter Rost , in Gardasil documentary , One More Girl , posted by Arjun Wala , July 7 , 2015 , .\nwhich adds up to 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time which adds 71 more doses by age 65 , for a lifetime load of 149 doses by age 65 , not counting the extra doses for seniors above 65 , pregnant women ( and their unborn fetuses ) , and other special indications .\nforces to promotethe benefit of vaccines , '' Joint News Release , WHO , \u2022 Cf .\nHarris , C. , `` Anti-vaxxers most prominent in Bulgaria , Latvia , and France , '' Euronews , Oct. 26 , 2018 ;

Instead , by remaining silent and doing nothing for so many weeks , it allowed the President to have his way , until the surge in new cases threatened to overwhelm the capacity of hospitals and clinics to care for them , making containment of the outbreak seem impossible , and thus appearing to necessitate `` flattening the curve , '' by means of a generalized lockdown and shutdown of the economy , even though these measures would necessarily prolong the outbreak and very likely insure the emergence of mutant strains as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , even if they were genuinely unnerved and uncertain , their prolonged hesitation has brought about a disaster of epic proportions , not to mention the fact that , if Trump 's blustering , bullying , and threats of retaliation had actually cowed them into submission , their timidity would be even harder to forgive .\nIn any case , by far the simplest explanation , which would also help explain why their response continues to be half-hearted and chaotic even now , is that the CDC leadership actually wanted and indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way , because they had already decided to invest their time , money , and energy in developing and promoting a new vaccine against the virus , which had long since become their default strategy for dealing with infectious diseases of every kind .\nGiven the official line , and the censoring of all competing versions , this conjecture would already qualify as a `` conspiracy theory '' of sorts ; but what gives it a lot more credence than it should have is the coincidence that CDC officials actively participated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 , that envisioned and indeed actively planned for a coronavirus pandemic uncannily like the one we are now living through , just two months before the first cases were announced to the world.6 Organized jointly by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security , the World Economic Forum , and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the so-called `` Event 201 '' invited legislators , corporate executives , health policy makers , and representatives of the news and social media to attend , and postulated a global crisis involving millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 months , until either an effective vaccine became available , or 80-90 % of the world 's population had already been exposed and thus developed a robust , natural , `` herd '' immunity , whichever came first , although flattening the curve and thus prolonging the outbreak was rapidly pre-empting the second possibility.7 In late January , just three weeks after the first cases appeared in China , the World Economic Forum duly announced its own COVID Action Platform , a global partnership to expedite vaccine development , followed a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Health Emergency , signing on to precisely the same 18-month scenario that the organizers of Event 201 had already mapped out.8 Simply by waiting and doing nothing further to arrest or contain it , the CDC 's subsequent actions for flattening the curve , above all locking down homes and businesses and outlawing large public and private gatherings , came to be perceived by the general public as the most prudent course of action , even though it would necessarily prolong the outbreak , and the fear that goes with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutant strains to develop , and thus making further waves of COVID-19 much more likely , so that the mounting fears of most people became entirely reasonable , whether deliberately planned for or not .\nIn a 2020 interview , the well-known author and activist Naomi Klein seized upon the pandemic as a perfect illustration of `` disaster capitalism , '' a term she coined in her 2007 book , The Shock Doctrine : the Rise of Disaster Capitalism : Disaster capitalism describes [ how ] private industries profit from large-scale crises .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bush administration after 9/11 , when the administration declared this sort of never- ending security crisis , and simultaneously privatized it and outsourced it\u2014this included the domestic , privatized security state , as well as the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan .\nThe \u201c shock doctrine \u201d is the political strategy of using large-scale crises to push through policies that systematically deepen inequality , enrich elites , and under- cut everyone else .\nIn moments of crisis , people tend to focus on the daily emergencies of surviving that crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put too much trust in those in power .\nWe take our eyes off the ball in moments of crisis .\nThe shock is the virus , [ and its being ] managed in a way that is maximizing confusion and minimizing protection .\nI don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s a conspiracy , it \u2019 s just the way the U.S. government [ has ] utterly mismanaged the crisis .\nIt \u2019 s the worst- case scenario , combined with the fact that the U.S. doesn \u2019 t have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protections for workers are abysmal.9 In any case , flattening the curve and locking down quickly became the official narrative of what was happening , such that natural herd immunity seemed increasingly impossible , and indeed actually undesirable , as Dr. Fauci was quick to point out , since those who achieved it might no longer want or seem to need a vaccine.10 The crowning irony , then , no matter how often and how vehemently Trump vented his spleen against Fauci , the CDC , and the `` Deep State '' they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's debunking inaction , echoed by that of the party he still holds captive despite losing the election , was actually a giant step toward fulfilling the very agenda he claimed to despise , not to mention letting Fauci and the CDC off the hook , and indeed widely celebrated as the true voices of reason , science , and public health .\nGiven the enormous but still imprecisely known number of asymptomatic cases and others still unidentified , the true death rate is unknown , but clearly much lower than the calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know that the vast majority of even confirmed cases recover , and that even larger numbers contract and recover from the infection without bothering to see a doctor , getting tested , or indeed feeling sick in any way.11 But two highly unusual properties of the virus have amplified not only the panic and uncertainty surrounding it , but also the global reach of the COVID illness linked to it , into what has become a truly worldwide menace that seemed and still seems to warrant its pandemic status .\nThe first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or very mild infections , aggravated by our tardiness , indifference , and failure to locate and identify them both early and widely enough , as we saw , which has generated a crippling fear and uncertainty about the actual trajectory of the outbreak and where on its curve we happen to be situated at any given moment .\nThe second , which relates directly to the vaccine scenario , is its extraordinary mutability , as indicated by recurrent , cyclical phases of sharp declines in the number of reported cases , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in various parts of the world associated with new mutant variants.12,13 In 2021 , with the advent of mass vaccination , several of these have already created new surges in reported cases,14 with every likelihood that the vaccines will actually accelerate these mutations,15,16 if indeed they have n't already done so .\nAs with the influenza vaccines , but perhaps even more so , this genetic instability will probably limit the effectiveness of vaccines developed against a particular strain to relatively brief windows of time , and persuade the industry , the CDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones at least every year , if not oftener .\nSo we have every reason to expect that not just one new vaccine , but almost certainly a whole battery of them , are coming our way with all possible speed , and that our dithering with the outbreak , protecting the children from getting sick , and our massive vaccination program will all keep the virus around for much longer than the year and a half that it has already lived and taken life among us .\nIn addition , independent scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the case numbers and deaths have been inflated in America and elsewhere , casting serious doubt on the high death rates reported in the official statistics , and thus discrediting the CDC narrative that adds to that fear and spreads it far and wide .\nTo begin with , the unprecedentedly high number of asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic cases strongly indicate that there are many , many more cases of infection and many , many fewer deaths legitimately attributable to it than have been reported so far , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when the pandemic begins to recede , as more and more people are tested .\nIn an attempt to determine the true incidence of cases , including those infected or in contact with the virus but showing few or no symptoms , one survey designed by Prof. John Ioannidis of Stanford tested all residents of Santa Clara County , California for specific antibodies , and found them at a rate of 50 to 85 times higher than the number of confirmed cases , which if extrapolated to the general population would bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same range as the typical seasonal flu , in the neighborhood of 0.12 to 0.2 % of those infected.17 In addition , the data from almost everywhere indicate that the vast majority of deaths occur among the ranks of the elderly , infirm , and chronically ill ; and in most American hospitals , cities , and states , patients who tested positive but died from their significant comorbidities were nevertheless signed off as having died from rather than simply with the COVID,18,19 a major source of ambiguity , and still further exaggerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their COVID-19 cases , with even larger awards for their deaths , potent incentives for padding their statistics with even `` probable '' cases that were never confirmed by test.20 Another source of inaccuracy is the test that the case numbers are based on , the Polymerase Chain Reaction or PCR , which is designed to detect coronavirus RNA fragments rather than live virus , and is thereby subject to numerous false positives , and thus to further manipulations in that direction.21,22 For precisely these reasons , the late Kary Mullis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nobel Prize for it in 1993 , warned early on against using it to diagnose infectious diseases.23 An especially troubling feature of the CDC agenda was its `` warp-speed '' program for fast-tracking the development of new vaccines , which has allowed the firms involved in the competition to skip the time-consuming but critical step of animal testing and proceed immediately to human trials , an omission that will inevitably and gravely jeopardize both their safety and effectiveness .\nJaded vaccine-watchers with a taste for the macabre will doubtless find grim amusement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotez and Dr. Paul Offit , darlings of the industry who almost never meet a vaccine they do n't like , suddenly arguing against fast-tracking these futuristic vaccines without large-scale studies to prove their efficacy,24 or animal testing to insure their safety,25 belated pangs of conscience long overdue , to put it mildly .\nSo here we are , more than 330 million of us in this country alone , marooned in Dr. Fauci 's overcrowded lifeboat , with still no land in sight , and no reliable treatment recommended or made widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs of admittedly limited effectiveness , while several other promising pharmaceuticals are ignored , discredited , or set aside , and natural medicines of proven worth , like herbs , vitamins , nutritional supplements , and homeopathics , are scornfully dismissed as old-fashioned and of no value .\nThe CDC has developed and matured its staunchly and almost exclusively pro-vaccine agenda over a period of many decades .\nIts original mission , like that of many other agencies of the Federal government , exemplified the activist spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public works to revive the country from the ravages of the Great Depression , and was carried out by a professional civil service , recruited mainly from the biological sciences and medicine .\nSince the 1970 's , when the radical right gained control of the Republican Party , one of its main purposes has been to roll back these achievements by defunding the Federal bureaucracy and downsizing its career civil service , especially those agencies assisting the most vulnerable -- the poor , the elderly , the sick and handicapped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereby neglecting its functions of insuring occupational safety , and of protecting the air , water , soil , and food supply from toxins , pollutants , and other hazardous by-products of industry.26 The CDC , FDA , and NIH , the main Federal agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services , have survived these cuts by accepting huge infusions of cash from the drug industry and super-wealthy private donors , and by approving and promoting their products by way of thanks .\nIn place of time-honored and labor-intensive public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground to test air , water , food , and soil and trace the spread of epidemic diseases , they have come to rely more and more on drugs , chemicals , and above all vaccines , as their magic wand for warding off infectious diseases of every kind .\nIn 2003 , as a UPI reporter summarized it , The CDC is in the vaccine business .\nUnder a 1980 law , it has 28 licensing agreements with companies for vaccines and vaccine-related products .\nMembers of its Advisory Committee get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owning their stock , performing their research , monitoring their tests , and funding the academic departments to which they belong .\nThis situation , while legal , gives reason to worry that vaccine side-effects are worse than CDC officials say.27 A 2013 press release from the industry website listed 270 new vaccines already in the pipeline at various stages of the clinical trial process or under FDA review.28 The manufacturers achieved their ultimate victory in 1986 , after parents of infants brain-damaged from the DPT won damages in court , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for identifying vaccine injuries in children and compensating them swiftly and generously without requiring a lengthy trial.29 At the last minute the industry threatened to stop making vaccines entirely unless the law shielded them from financial liability in the future , a free ride granted to no other industry ; 30 and Congress gave in , accepting the industry 's minimal list of compensable reactions as their own , and setting up a Federal mechanism for compensating victims that is heavily stacked against them , such that very few of them succeed.31 In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , on the basis that vaccines are `` unavoidably unsafe , '' in Justice Scalia 's memorable phrasing , as if worthy of and hence forever in need of such protection.32 Thus freed from all damage claims , the manufacturers now have carte blanche to manufacture vaccines against any diseases or infirmities they wish , often for no better reason than that they have the technical capacity to do so , with the CDC and the FDA all but guaranteed to approve them .\nAided by the widespread veneration that vaccines have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the medical profession , the CDC has completed its transformation from an independent agency protecting the public interest into the head cheerleader for the pharmaceutical industry it was supposed to be regulating , while still going through the motions of its original purpose .\nIts secret for keeping up that pretense lies in its impossibly strict standards for vaccine injuries , which are identical to those vanishingly few listed in the safety trials of the manufacturers , and make a mockery of accepted scientific standards , avoiding placebo controls of unvaccinated persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week or two after the shot , as well as those not already approved on the list , and giving the lead investigator absolute authority to disallow reported injuries for any reason at all.33 The inevitable result has been a massive underreporting of chronic diseases , acute injuries , and deaths occasioned by vaccines , estimated by a former head of the FDA to be only 1 % of the actual figure,34 which has helped to convince the general public and most of the medical profession that these products are ideally safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permissible and indeed desirable to pile on as many as we want , and to give them as often as we like,35 despite ample scientific research to the contrary , and candid revelations of malfeasance from agency and industry insiders .\nIn 2014 , a senior CDC scientist issued a formal apology that agency higher-ups had suppressed experimental data proving that the MMR frequently caused autism : I regret that my co-authors and I omitted significant information in our 2004 article in Pediatrics , that African-American males who received the MMR before 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a documentary on the HPV vaccine , a former Vice-President of Pfizer all but boasted of his strong-arm tactics to promote their products , in flagrant violation of the ethical standards that Pfizer still subscribes to , which nevertheless remain standard practice throughout the industry : Universities and health organizations are begging for money .\nThe only ones who have money are the big corporations , and they have lots of it .\nThey give grants for research , pay doctors thousands to speak at conferences and make profits for their products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent , but the money wo n't keep coming unless they say what you want them to say .\nEverybody knows this is how things work .\nOnly the public does n't know it.37 The industry has added more and more vaccines to the recommended list,38 together with their steadfast insistence , seconded by the CDC and most of the medical profession , that the skyrocketing prevalence of chronic diseases , and the ever-increasing number and variety of adverse reactions being complained of by parents , their friends , and their doctors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before COVID , the vaccine manufacturers launched a global campaign for maximizing vaccination rates everywhere , backed by WHO and funded by many of the same wealthy donors who back the CDC.40 In the United States , they persuaded several blue states to propose laws eliminating non-medical exemptions entirely , some of which were enacted .\nIn Europe , they convinced the EU and several member countries to propose sweeping new mandates and to enforce them by making passports and drivers ' licenses contingent on full compliance,41 which led to massive street demonstrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protest them,42 along with the hi-tech control of personal data that such surveillance would require .\nAppearing as if coincidentally in the thick of these efforts , the COVID pandemic , whatever may have caused it , has provided the drug industry and its obscenely wealthy benefactors the perfect opportunity to upstage their critics and achieve their ultimate goals , as grandly set forth in the WHO Prospectus : Immunization is a global health success story , saving millions of lives every year .\nIt is the foundation of primary health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the best investments that money can buy .\nWith the support of countries and partners , WHO is leading the creation of a new global strategy for the next decade .\nIt envisions a world in which everyone , everywhere , and at every age fully benefits from vaccination to improve health and well-being.43 By branding the COVID a pandemic , the CDC , the WHO , the vaccine industry , and their mega-rich donors have cultivated an atmosphere of urgency , fear , and uncertainty by prolonging the economic shutdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus helping to bring about the conditions for the general public in most of the world to long for a vaccine as their only hope of escaping from the crisis and returning to a semblance of the life they were forced to leave behind .\nAlthough coronaviruses had been known and studied for decades , the SARS epidemic of 2002-03 , a zo\u00f6nosis originating in bats , became the starting-point for accelerated investigations of them at military and non-military virology labs around the world.44 The U. S. Army bioweapons facility in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' research , to make them even more contagious and virulent than the wild types , up to and including the hypothetical capacity to unleash global pandemics.45 In 2011 , many scientists voiced deep misgivings about the risk of such `` superbugs '' escaping from their laboratory environments and infecting the general public.46 Three years later , when a few such leaks were reported to have occurred from a CDC facility,47 the Obama Administration finally declared a halt to all gain-of-function research.48 Early in 2017 , shortly after Trump was inaugurated , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a division of NIH headed by Dr. Fauci , gave a grant of $ 3.7 million to the Chinese government lab in Wuhan to resume them.49 In 2020 , Trump belatedly terminated them to try to escape responsibility for his part in the pandemic , shifting the blame to China , home of the first known case , and President Obama , his b\u00eate noire of record , falsely insisting that the grant had been his idea.50 It also came out that the moneys in question , while bearing the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and administered by a consortium of universities and private companies known as the EcoHealth Alliance , just one of an extensive network of similar public-private partnerships of which the public was largely unaware.51 The labyrinthine auspices of these partnerships raised troubling ethical questions as to who actually owns and profits from the drugs and vaccines developed under their auspices.52 In addition , they enable super-rich investors to write off their contributions as charitable donations , while profiting vaccine manufacturers and other companies that they own or are heavily invested in , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' that generates huge profits , outsize influence , and a cachet of respectability because of the seemingly worthy causes they so righteously support.53 In any case , it is clear that the United States military and scientific communities have been actively studying , designing , and manufacturing ever-deadlier coronaviruses for quite a long time .\nThe program was in full swing from 2004 until 2014 , when President Obama brought it to a halt , only to be revived shortly after Trump was elected and throughout Trump 's term in office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the COVID was at its height , this time with funding provided by NIH grantees to China 's Wuhan lab , under Dr. Fauci 's sponsorship .\nFor that reason alone , the additional facts \u2022 that the virus outstrips all others we know of in the percentage of infected people who are asymptomatic or only mildly ill , \u2022 that it selectively kills and cripples those who are already chronically ill , \u2022 that it appears to be even more mutable then the influenza viruses , and \u2022 that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termination in some patient that is still not completely understood , all make it appear highly probable \u2022 that it was manufactured in the Wuhan lab , to a great extent with our help , if not at our behest , \u2022 that it escaped , presumably by just the sort of accident that our scientists have long been worried about , and \u2022 that the program had succeeded brilliantly in accomplishing precisely what its paymasters had in mind As far as I 'm aware , nobody is openly congratulating our soldiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well done ; but we need to make it clear to them and everyone else that it 's a job we need to stop doing once and for all , since the morbidity and mortality that the COVID has already caused are only the beginning of the dire threat it continues to pose to everyone on the planet .\nIn any case , the fact that advocates of mass vaccination have been predicting just such an event for years , and even staged the infamous Event 201 to plan for it , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some scientists that the outbreak actually began months earlier , in the late summer or fall of 2019 , such that at least the organizers of Event 201 were already aware of it .\nBut whether or not the CDC was forewarned , \u2022 what we were doing with the Chinese in Wuhan was a disaster waiting to happen , if not now , then at some future time \u2022 Trump and his cronies bear major responsibility for it , as do Dr. Fauci and the CDC , however much they keep blaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flattening the curve and locking down until the vaccine comes to the rescue , regardless of precisely when it was devised and settled on , has brought about a national and global catastrophe far more grievous than any-thing that the virus , bioengineered or not , would have achieved on its own .\n\u2022 Holshue , M. , et al.\n, `` First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States , '' \u2022 Cf.\n, for example , Cai , J. , `` Indirect Virus Transmission in Cluster of COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A. , `` The life and rise of Dr. Anthony Fauci , the public-health hero who has become the face of America 's Coronavirus response \u2022 Cf .\nChen , C. , et al.\n, `` Key Missteps at the CDC Have Set Back Its Ability to Detect the Potential Spread of the Coronavirus , '' ProPublica , , February \u2022 Cf.\n, for example , `` Perspectives on the Pandemic II : a Conversation with Dr. Knut Wittkowski , The Press and the Public Project , , April 2 , \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can Learn from a Pandemic `` Tabletop Exercise , '' \u2022 Cf .\nNaomi Klein , `` Coronavirus is the Perfect Disaster for Disaster Capitalism , '' \u2022 Cf .\nWeise , E. , `` 8 strains of the coronavirus are circling the globe .\nHere 's what \u2022 Cf.\n, for example , Mercola , J. , `` New Delta Virus Variant Escalates Lockdowns , '' \u2022 Richard Harris , `` COVID-19 Vaccines Could Add Fuel to Evolution of Corona- \u2022 Krause , P. , et al.\n, `` SARS-CoV-2 Variants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 Rogers , M. , `` Fact Check : Hospitals get paid more if patients listed as COVID- \u2022 `` Coronavirus : the Truth about the PCR Test Kit from the Inventor and Other \u2022 Johnson , C. , `` Inside the extraordinary race to invent a coronavirus vaccine , '' \u2022 This powerful , oligarchic movement , reversing FDR 's New Deal , and promoting laissez-faire capitalism , the free market , and the doctrine of states ' rights that originated in the slave states of the antebellum south , is skillfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. , Democracy in Chains : the Deep History of the Radical Right 's Stealth Plan for America , Penguin , 2017 .\n\u2022 Holland , `` Liability for Vaccine Injury : the United States , Europe , and the \u2022 Holland , 2011 , op .\ncit.\n, and with Robert Krakow , Esq.\n, `` The Right to Legal Redress , '' in The Vaccine Epidemic , Skyhorse , New York , 2011 , pp .\n39-40 .\nMedication and Device Adverse Effects , '' Journal of the AMA 269:2765 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` History of Vaccine Safety , '' CDC , \u2022 `` Statement of William Thompson , Ph .\nD. , Regarding the 2004 Article Examining the Possibility of a Relationship between the MMR Vaccine and Autism , '' Press Release , Morgan Verkamp LLC , August 27 , 2014 .\n\u2022 Interview with Dr. Peter Rost , in Gardasil documentary , One More Girl , posted by Arjun Wala , July 7 , 2015 , .\nwhich adds up to 70 separate doses of individual vaccine components by the time which adds 71 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifetime load of 149 doses by age 65 , not counting the extra doses for seniors above 65 , pregnant women ( and their unborn fetuses ) , and other special indications .\nforces to promotethe benefit of vaccines , '' Joint News Release , WHO , \u2022 Cf .\nHarris , C. , `` Anti-vaxxers most prominent in Bulgaria , Latvia , and France , '' Euronews , Oct. 26 , 2018 ;

S. and the whole industrialized world have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and largely disregard the pesticides , herbicides , fluorohydrocarbons , endocrine disruptors , and innumerable other chemicals that pollute our air , water , soil , and food , not to mention the electromagnetic emissions and ionizing radiations from our machines and devices , the pathophysiology of our fast-paced and stressful way of life , and perhaps most of all , the morbidity and mortality of poverty , war , racism , oppression , incarceration , and homelessness , all of which are more prevalent in the United States than in any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable cause of chronic disease that still flies under the radar is vaccination .\nVaccines are explicitly targeted to the entire population , especially children , and injected directly into the blood , giving them free and immediate access to our internal organs on a long-term basis .\nIn practice , I began witnessing their major contribution to our chronic disease burden more than 30 years ago,73 and it has since been amply confirmed in both clinical and basic-science research.74 Yet most of us are still unaware of it , and go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scientists , and the parents of vaccine-injured children try to point it out .\nMany of the kids I saw already had asthma , eczema , allergies , ear infections , ADHD , autism , or learning disabilities ; and their original illnesses often began several weeks or even months after their shots , well beyond the narrow limits set by the CDC for an adverse reaction to be acknowledged as vaccine-related.75 At first , all I noticed was that they got worse after their vaccines ; and with so many vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often difficult to make even that connection until they recovered with the help of natural medicine and remained well for some months , but then worsened dramatically after the next shots , when it became obvious to the parents as well.76 But this pattern was common enough to be the rule , rather than the exception , no matter what disease the children were suffering from , or which vaccine happened to precipitate it , all of which made it clear that , far from being merely aberrations or `` side effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rare , coincidental tendencies of each hypersensitive child , they are routine , baseline responses to some inherent property of the vaccination process itself.77 The logical inference seemed to be that even the most serious reactions -- autism , brain damage , life-threatening autoimmune diseases , and death -- might turn out to be special cases built upon that same foundation .\nThis line of reasoning has gained added credence from research studies showing that the risk of adverse reactions has mainly to do with the total number of individual vaccines given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also cumulatively over the patient 's lifetime.79 These findings reminded me that most of the infections we vaccinate against are acute phenomena , involving fever and a massive outpouring of the entire immune system working in concert to expel the invading organism from the blood,80,81,82 so that the resulting natural immunity not only protects against reinfection later in life , but primes the immune mechanism to respond acutely and vigorously to whatever other invading organisms it may encounter in the future .\nThe incomparable value of this gift to our health is hinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those who recover from measles , mumps , chickenpox , and influenza as children are much less prone to develop chronic autoimmune diseases and cancer later in life than those merely vaccinated against them.83 Vaccines , by contrast , are injected directly into the blood , with no incubation period , no acute illness , no massive outpouring , and thus no effective way of getting rid of them .\nIn fact , they are designed to remain inside the body more or less permanently , to continue stimulating antibody synthesis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous and sustained antibody response , the `` non-living '' vaccines made from bacteria ( DTaP , pneumo , HiB ) and bioengineered viruses ( Hep B , HPV ) require chemical adjuvants , notably water-soluble aluminum salts , which are toxic all by themselves , and form complexes of high molecular weight that can not be excreted in the urine,84 while the live-virus vaccines ( MMR , varicella , rotavirus , shingles ) are capable of entering host cells and remaining there indefinitely as `` episomes '' attached to their genetic material.85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chronic phenomenon ; and the partial , temporary , and essentially counterfeit immunity it provides does nothing to prime the immune mechanism as a whole , much less protect us from developing chronic diseases in the future .\nOn the contrary , as we saw , vaccines are an important starting-point for chronic disease , though certainly not the only one , and mainly subclinical at first , but all too often a lot more than that .\nIt is thus profoundly misleading , if not the exact opposite of the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protects us from an acute infection if it gives it to us chronically instead , such that we 're incapable of getting rid of it , and are somewhat less capable of responding acutely to it if it reappears in the future , and perhaps to other foreign antigens as well .\nMostly what we 're being told by manufacturers , the CDC , and the medical profession is that vaccines are uniformly and miraculously safe and effective , so that it is entirely acceptable and even desirable to pile on as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we like,86 while the general public and the bulk of the medical and scientific communities cling to the belief , with a fervor reminiscent of born-again religion , that vaccines have saved countless lives and have caused many deadly diseases to disappear from the earth .\nIn that vein , the CDC , the WHO , and the multinational drug industry that essentially funds and controls these agencies have already injected COVID vaccines into hundreds of millions , and are now promoting and mandating them worldwide , as our last hope of deliverance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a semblance of our former way of life , without the slightest acknowledgement that , no matter what else they do or fail to do , they will surely contribute their own huge and to some extent irreversible load to the momentous and fast-growing burden of chronic disease that we already bear .\nBased on my years of experience caring for vaccine-injured children , I appeal to my readers to hear the voices of thousands upon thousands of parents who personally witnessed the deaths and crippling illnesses and injuries of their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must live every day amid the wreckage of their shattered lives , sufficient to break any heart , that cries out at the very least for caution , restraint , and simple compassion for the viewpoint of those whose lived experience , whatever may have caused it , is so tragically different from that of everyone else privileged enough to be ignorant of or somehow unmoved by their loss .\nThe simplest way to say it is that , if vaccines were truly as safe and effective as the CDC and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast majority of these parents would have to be either lying , ignorant , deluded , or stupid , like those `` anti-vaxxers '' demonized in the media , clinging to a wildly-flawed , anti-scientific ideology .\nHaving cared for many , many such children , I can say with complete assurance 1 ) that their parents are none of these , but simply eyewitnesses to tragedy , who must now bear the burden of that grief and the expense of caring for their loved ones for the rest of their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a more accurate term , since their only mistake was to have done exactly what they were told ; 3 ) that they are asking for nothing more than a public acknowledgment of their plight , although they surely deserve a great deal more than that ; and 4 ) that caring parents are far better judges of what happened to their kids than those who make , sell , and profit obscenely from the products that did the damage , and ca n't even be sued for it .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got here , we are now in the midst of a global plague and the enormous , interconnected crises arising from it , with no choice but to figure out how to live and thrive as best as we can , and to end the nightmare we all share .\nThe only answer I think we all can agree on is that we do n't know , that the lack of sufficient , accurate information leaves us with a profound uncertainty that feeds our fear , and makes us yearn to put our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their vaccine-based agenda , even when both science and common sense point in precisely the opposite direction .\nWe still do n't know precisely how many of us are sick , how many are infected but not sick , how many are neither infected nor sick , and how many were infected , whether sick or not , but are so no longer .\nOne thing we can say with assurance is that many , many more people have already been infected than we have any record of .\nBut with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we still do n't know how long the outbreak will last , or for how long those who 've already had it and recovered will be immune to a recurrence .\nRecent data indicate that they will enjoy a robust immunity,87 longer and stronger , I 'm guessing , than what any vaccine can provide .\nOn the other hand , many patients who seemed to recover have since developed the `` long-haul '' COVID , with serious , persistent complications whose future remains uncertain .\nThe test for specific antibodies against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of becoming infected , and is thus valuable proof of having recently contacted the virus.88 But it would be oppressive to quarantine or penalize those who claim to have been ill with the virus in the past , but no longer have the antibodies to prove it .\nWe should n't assume that those with high titers have acquired the desired level of immunity , or that those showing no antibodies are still susceptible and should be revaccinated for that reason.89 But we make both mistakes routinely , because antibodies are how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to generate high titers for a long time .\nThe natural response to infection is a massive , co-ordinated process , of which antibodies are only the finishing touch.90 Once we recover , they 're no longer needed , because the memory of the virus is encrypted within the B and T cells.91 In other words , we 're measuring the wrong thing : the immune process is directed by those cells , which then preserve the immunity we 've earned , in ways that we do n't seem to know or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now generally accepted that most if not all severe and fatal cases of COVID are associated with hyperimmune , antibody-derived enhancement reactions like `` cytokine storm , '' with unusually high levels of inflammatory cytokines,92 and that long-haul COVID also involves persisting hyperimmune reactions of lower intensity.93 Similar reactions were observed in animal trials against the SARS and other early coronaviruses,94 and more recently during a vaccination campaign against dengue fever in the Philippines.95 In both cases , the subjects developed wonderfully high levels of specific antibodies soon after the vaccines were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from severe hyperimmune reactions when they contacted the virus some time later .\nSuch dramatic misfortunes caused the programs making use of these vaccines to be terminated , and alarmed even pro-vaccine advocates to plead for caution and shy away when the first COVID vaccines were fast-tracked using the same technology.96 So , once again , these bottom-line uncertainties leave us all in a vast no-man's-land , somewhere between all those well-meaning people who fear that the danger of COVID remains extreme , such that the lockdowns must continue , and that large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases who dismiss the pandemic as a hoax , and insist that we no longer need to wear masks or keep up social distancing , and can resume our normal lives .\nWhat I 'm looking for is a third way , not just a compromise between these extremes .\nThe shutdown of our economy and our way of life is so much more destructive than the virus itself that we need to find a path to moving beyond the extreme fear and panic that have driven us to try to prevent every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand-new and dangerous the virus seems to be , after a year and a half we need to learn how to live with it , as we already do with our annual flu outbreaks , and as the ongoing parade of further variants will eventually force us to do .\nThis clearly means learning how to tolerate a certain number of cases in those at lowest risk , like schoolchildren , adolescents , and young adults , and treating them effectively when they do occur , while doing our utmost to protect our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most vulnerable .\nThis is the time-honored way for developing natural herd immunity as rapidly as possible ; and if we had done that in the beginning , the outbreak would most likely have ended last year , with many , many fewer casualties .\nStill more lives would have been saved had we deigned to treat the illness , rather than simply waiting for the vaccine that we were misled into believing would prevent it .\nUnfortunately , that eminently sensible and humane recommendation , made by reputable epidemiologists and clinicians throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the delta variant and others resurgent around the world , the threat of further lockdowns , vaccine mandates , and vaccine `` passports '' to force people into compliance are all conspiring to push the society in precisely the opposite direction .\nOne seemingly minor but important step toward recovery would be to skip the annual flu vaccine for the duration , because reputable studies have shown that a recent flu shot increases the risk of respiratory infections with coronaviruses and others.98 Further research is needed to determine if , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more severe , and , if so , to ascertain the extent to which other vaccines accumulated over the lifespan might also be contributing .\nMy educated guess is that patients severely ill , hospitalized , and dying from COVID will also prove more likely to have received more vaccines over their lifetime than those who test positive but are less severely ill or not ill at all .\nApart from the health risks of the COVID vaccines themselves , the most astonishing , disturbing , and infuriating aspect of the rollout is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other public health officials that the unvaccinated are responsible for prolonging the outbreak , and that vaccination is our last , best , and indeed our only hope for ending it , despite knowing full well that flattening the curve has already kept it alive much too long , offering no effective treatment for the illness once it appears , and ignoring or opposing reliable , inexpensive treatments that physicians and health professionals have nevertheless been using on their own .\nA good example is Chinese herbal medicine , with thousands of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many studies in accredited journals attesting to its value in treating COVID,99 which may help explain why the Chinese have dealt with the outbreak so much more effectively than we have .\nA number of American physicians have reported consistently excellent success in both preventing and treating the COVID with nutritional supplements , such as Dr. David Brownstein 's high-dose regimen of oral Vitamin A , C , D , and iodine , plus intravenous infusions of the same for those most seriously ill.100 In his series of 520 confirmed , symptomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitalizations and no deaths.101 In China , another group of physicians documented shorter hospital stays for seriously ill COVID inpatients using high doses of vitamin C intravenously.102 Hydroxychloroquine , a widely-used antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug , has shown considerable effectiveness in numerous anecdotal reports and several reputable studies , as has Colchicine , another plant-based drug still used in the treatment of gout.103 Most recently , Ivermectin , a well-known and relatively nontoxic antiparasitic drug , has generated the most excitement of all for its record in treating COVID at every level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hyperimmune states that represent its leading cause of death.104 But the NIH finds insufficient evidence for recommending any of them , and the CDC remains icily indifferent or hostile to them all.105 Although still in limited supply , monoclonal antibodies purified from convalescent plasma may become an exception , since the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for them,106 and several recent studies found them highly effective in hastening improvement and shortening hospital stays in severely-ill patients.107 Finally , although still widely ignored and even ridiculed by the medical profession , homeopathic medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46 years , has been in continuous use for over two centuries , and enjoyed notable success in treating scarlet fever , cholera , yellow fever , typhoid fever , influenza , and other epidemic diseases in the past.108 In Kerala , a populous state in South India with only 23 confirmed deaths in the first wave , its success in minimizing the impact of COVID was widely ascribed to the provincial government 's policy of distributing homeopathic medicines preventively to all citizens.109 After some months , vaccines were administered on a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delta variant the number of cases and deaths rose sharply , to levels more comparable to those in neighboring states.110 Similarly in Cuba , the government 's first response to the pandemic was to make the homeopathic medicine Arsenicum album available to everyone , to use both preventively and as needed for treatment ; with a population of 11 million , they recorded only 14,600 cases and 150 deaths in all of 2020.111 But then , just as in Kerala , the government rolled out its own massive vaccination program , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delta variant , 120,000 in August alone , and 4200 deaths , figures in the same range as those of their neighbors.112 Clinically , a group of 50 symptomatic patients in Italy with confirmed or probable COVID recovered without a single hospitalization or death under homeopathic treatment.113 Under the care of an expert Canadian homeopath , a number of critically-ill COVID patients in a French nursing home recovered and remained in stable condition using the classical method of one homeopathic medicine at a time , as he described in a webinar presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the same Institute , a database of hundreds of cases treated by our members thus far , and ranging from mild to severe , has demonstrated a high rate of cure using many of the same medicines most commonly employed during the usual flu season , as well as others individualized to severe cases with more distinctive symptomatology.115 Whether because or in spite of its apparent helplessness and/or disinterest in actually treating the COVID , organized medicine in the United States has never invited leading homeopaths , naturopaths , or integrative physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all share .\nYet the obvious and well-documented benefits of both traditional and complementary medicine in preventing and treating the illness give ample reason to hope and expect that the COVID phenomenon will eventually , and indeed sooner rather than later , go the way of other flu-like illnesses , with substantial , long-lasting immunity , and maybe periodic recycling in the future , whether because or in spite of the spate of vaccines that are sure to follow .\nI hope that our embattled sense of humor can still appreciate the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency use by the FDA no longer even claim to prevent infection or transmission of the virus , as vaccines are meant to do , and that ironically , after waiting so long for them , all they do seem to be capable of doing is precisely to treat the illness , to relieve its symptoms , soften its impact , and lessen its severity , palliative effects which stretch our concept of `` vaccine '' as a preventive well beyond what it can reasonably bear .\nAs a clinician , I vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we already have and know about , rather than trying to prevent it with vaccines , which they fail to do in any case,116 or to use them merely for symptom relief , because they carry such formidable risks of their own .\nI need go no further than the virtual certainty that the natural immunity acquired by recovering from the COVID , however long it lasts , will prove itself superior to the poor semblance of it that vaccines can provide , as well as protecting us against variants arising in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Nobel Prize-winning virologist , a second big reason for avoiding the COVID vaccines in the midst of the pandemic is that they already have and will undoubtedly continue to generate new variants increasingly resistant to them , and that the risk of hyperimmune reactions when contacting the virus will be higher in the vaccinated , in direct proportion to the level of specific antibodies in the blood.118 A third reason is that , at the very least , they will do what all vaccines do , as I 've said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , reactivating , exacerbating , and making more chronic whatever chronic tendencies are already latent or manifest in each individual recipient , which will also mean , in this particular case , making worse the baseline pathology of the COVID illness itself .\nPresumably most of these reactions will still develop insidiously and subclinically at first , and be just as difficult to recognize as they have always been , but augmented by the substantial risk of death or crippling injury occurring acutely in highly-sensitized individuals .\nThe official VAERS statistics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 571,831 adverse events , 77,490 serious injuries , and 12,791 deaths between December 14 , 2020 , and August 6 , 2021 , numbers far in excess of those that scandalized and ended the swine flu vaccine campaign in 1976.119 A fourth , brand-new reason to avoid the COVID vaccines is the bioengineered fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein , which is both the main source of the antibody-producing information conveyed in the mRNA vaccines and decisive in the pathogenesis of the COVID sickness .\nProfessor Byram Bridle and other Canadian virologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite toxic all by itself , and does not simply disintegrate at or near the injection site , as the manufacturers claim , but circulates widely through the blood after vaccination , and poses a significant risk of damaging the heart , lungs , liver , spleen , bone marrow , adrenals , ovaries , and other organs.120 If that much is true , it seems very likely that these toxic reactions will prove to be autoimmune in nature , just like the COVID itself , as well as the microscopically similar ADE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether widely-disseminated or localized to particular organs or tissues , and of varying degrees of severity and chronicity , as in the `` long COVID '' cases that complicate the original illness .\nIn any case , fear and uncertainty are a huge part of what this pandemic is all about , as we saw ; and the financial investment , global scale , and economic and political fallout of the vaccination rollout probably mean that , regardless of whether or to what extent it was deliberately intended and planned for in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to happen before the full magnitude of the artificial , manipulated component of this disaster is even acknowledged ; rectified it can never be .\nAt this point , most educated and public-spirited people in this country have already been vaccinated , genuinely feel relieved and protected by having done so , and openly regard those of us who have n't as seriously misguided , ideologically rigid , at high risk for refusing it , and selfishly threatening everyone else in so doing .\nThese reactions are all very much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CDC and the drug industry , conveyed through the media , and enforced by anonymous `` Fact-Checkers '' whose job it has become to remove any and all anti-vaccine content from public view , including social media , even if it consists of nothing more than raising doubts and asking questions , just as I 'm doing .\nAs I 've said , that narrative is based on assumptions that are false ; but I certainly ca n't blame the general public for believing it , since they have every right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official reports and statistics are accurate .\nSo even though we disagree , I 'm far from blaming or putting them down ; quite the contrary , on the whole I find their reasons entirely understandable , persuasive , and in many cases even admirable .\nSo it seems fitting for me to conclude this essay with trying to find the right words to say to them that they might now or eventually be willing and able to hear .\nI 'll begin with a disclaimer , 1 ) that we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outbreak , or where we 're going ; 2 ) that my thoughts about the virus being bioengineered and released are beliefs , opinions , hypotheses and speculations , merely the most probable I 've come up with so far , or at least worth considering , and I truly hope they 're wrong ; 3 ) that our shared uncertainty lies at the core of our experience living through it all ; and 4 ) that the fear that follows from it is what drives us to act in ways that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and counterproductive , or prudent and lifesaving , or perhaps both .\nThat much at least we do know .\nI have n't taken any vaccines myself for more than 60 years , for all the reasons I 've already cited .\nThe COVID vaccines are quite different , in that they 're given not to prevent the infection in the future , but rather in the midst of an actual outbreak , originally to prevent its spread , which the CDC now admits it fails to do , but now mainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness if it does appear , and thus reduce the likelihood of severe illness , hospitalization , and death , which it does seem to be doing somewhat effectively so far .\nMany of the people I know do n't trust everything the CDC says , or even deny the possibility that the vaccine may create chronic problems in the future .\nThe only reason they 've agreed to get a COVID shot and feel genuinely protected by it is that they 're depressed by and fed up with the lockdown , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the here and now , to visit family and friends , and to travel and engage with the outside world as before , without having to hide their faces and keep their distance .\nDowngrading the COVID from a life-threatening illness to a mild one like the flu makes that goal seem achievable .\nNor would I disagree that a legitimate government must have the authority to impose certain restrictions temporarily in the event of a genuine public health emergency , such as an imminent terrorist attack , provided it is carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to a truly grave threat , backed up by a clear scientific consensus , and ended as soon as the threat is over .\nBut although the COVID phenomenon is indeed a serious threat , it is far from meeting that standard .\nTo begin with , it can not be understood in a vacuum , apart from the recent history of active research into coronaviruses that began with SARS-CoV-1 , as we saw , and the worldwide campaign funded by the drug industry and proclaimed by the CDC and WHO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody against everything .\nIn the United States , largely in response to several relatively modest measles outbreaks in recent years , the CDC began pressuring state governments to eliminate personal-belief exemptions to existing vaccine mandates , and to further restrict even medical exemptions , which were always difficult to obtain .\nWhen several states changed their laws accordingly , members of Congress directed Facebook and other social media to remove all anti-vaccine content , in clear and flagrant violation of the First Amendment , as a result of which nameless `` fact-checkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce the censorship , in flagrant violation of the First Amendment , and without even the semblance of an emergency to justify it .\nIn that setting , the COVID provided the perfect opportunity for the government , the airlines , and a number of private businesses to require vaccine `` passports '' for foreign and domestic travel and other purposes , even without formally declaring a State of Emergency , not only to force the unvaccinated into compliance , but also to justify the surveillance of our personal information on a permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the COVID a bona-fide emergency that warrants imposing such requirements by force ?\nAgreed , it 's very contagious ; but even I , though at higher risk for being seriously ill if I develop it , still stand an excellent chance of recovering from it , and indeed , for all I know , might already have done so without ever knowing I had it .\nNor it is true , despite what we 're being told on a daily basis , that the unvaccinated are mainly if not solely responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak.121 For all of the reasons cited above , there 's plenty of evidence that quite the opposite is true , as it was for the CDC 's similar claim for those measles outbreaks the year before .\nWhat of the more than 600,000 deaths so far , in the US alone ?\nDoes n't that qualify as an emergency ?\nWell , it might , except for the fact that those figures have been inflated to an unknown but clearly massive extent by the preponderance of deaths among patients in nursing homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so forth , who merely tested positive for the virus but died of their pre-existing comorbidities , while patient deaths occurring shortly after receiving their COVID vaccines are routinely signed off as due to their comorbidities .\nIn short , these figures have been and are still being manipulated in both directions as we speak , and are therefore unreliable to a very large albeit unknown extent .\nSo the bottom line is that we unvaccinated are being pressured , bullied , and pleaded with to be injected with a bioengineered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to alter our chemistry more or less permanently , even if the agent itself is quickly inactivated and can no longer be detected chemically , simply to prevent us from dying or becoming seriously ill from an illness that we would very probably recover from on our own , with or without treatment , and that doing so would provide a more robust and long-lasting immunity against reinfection than any vaccine could conceivably provide .\nTo that choice , I must still say , no thank you , so long as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my power if I am required by law or mandate to receive it ; and to hope that everyone else will escape unscathed from having made a choice which , however sincere and well-intentioned , they did n't need and will surely do them harm .\nSo I hope that they will come to understand and forgive me for what I 've decided , that my speculations about the virus and the vaccines are mistaken , that the vaccination campaign will prove a great success , with no more variants appearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving us alive and free to live happily ever after .\nIf I come down with the COVID , and all my vitamins , homeopathic medicines , and whatever else do n't help me recover , such that I die of it , so be it ; but I 'd still rather take my chances with it than willingly subject my body and soul to what I truly believe is something at best only partially and temporarily effective , as well as profoundly dangerous both now and for the future .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the truth about the COVID will emerge before more damage is done , and that those who planned for it , are keeping it going by flattening the curve and manipulating the statistics , and thus make almost everyone on the planet long for these GMO toxins will be exposed , discredited , and brought to justice .\n\u2022 Ebhardt , T. , et al.\n, `` 99 % of

somewhere .\nBirmingham , UK : The government is sending a commissioner to take over special educational needs and disabilities ( SEND ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council failed to remedy \u201c significant

significant increase \u201d in Send provision during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting in extra resources and commissioning designated units within mainstream schools\u2026 .\nBut the report adds that because of

''\nThank you as always to the fearless Dr. Moskowitz .\nBy Richard Moskowitz , MD From the start of the outbreak , it was hard to ignore the possibility that the virus had been bioengineered in a lab , because Bill Gates and Tony Fauci had been warning of a coronavirus pandemic for years , and even staged the notorious `` Event 201 '' to plan for it just 2 months before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of the fact that the actual outbreak we 're now living through corresponded almost too precisely to the scenario they had projected .\nSoon the preponderance of asymptomatic cases made it seem quite likely that the outbreak had actually begun a few months earlier , in which case both Gates and Fauci might well have known about it .\nNor was it in the least implausible to imagine that they were already at work by then designing the Moderna vaccine in which they were both heavily invested .\nTo be sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do know is that the CDC waited for two months without testing to locate and isolate asymptomatic cases , so that lockdown came to seem necessary to `` flatten the curve , '' even though it would inevitably prolong the outbreak , and that it has continued to oppose and impede antiviral treatments that have nevertheless proved to be effective .\nSo again it is difficult to avoid the inference that they had committed themselves to the vaccine strategy from the start , especially since flattening the curve made natural herd immunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandate could be presented as the only practical solution .\nBut to my mind the most compelling evidence that the virus was manufactured lies in the highly unusual nature of the COVID illness that has resulted from it .\nPolio , measles , mumps , rubella , influenza , chickenpox , shingles , rotavirus , and other viral illnesses that we vaccinate against all follow an acute pattern , with high fever and a distinctive clinical picture that is easily recognizable in most cases and then burns itself out in a few weeks

Fauci \u2019 s job at NIAID is to research the sources of these chronic diseases and immune diseases and allergic diseases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causes .\nWe know it \u2019 s an environmental toxin , it has to be .\nGenes don \u2019 t cause epidemics .\nWhat I show in the book is , rather than doing that research , he spends virtually his entire $ 7.7 billion budget developing new drugs for pharmaceutical companies and doing bio-weapons research for the Pentagon and for the military industrial complex .\n$ 1.6billion a year of his budget goes to essentially weapons development , bio-weapons research .\nHe \u2019 s the highest paid individual in the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 a year that is $ 34,000 more than the President of the United States .\nHe has many , many other sources of income along with that job .\nSixty-eight percent of that budget comes from his management of bio-weapons research , and that \u2019 s why he was forced to do the gain-of-function studies in Wuhan and to manage them in Wuhan , because the Pentagon is paying him to do that kind of research and if he [ doesn \u2019 t ] he would lose the bulk of his salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gates fit into this picture ?\nHe \u2019 s the friendly guy with the sweater vest , and he \u2019 s just giving away billions to improve public health , and yet your book suggests that there is a darker side to all this as well .\nKennedy : Gates summons Anthony Fauci to his $ 87 million mansion on the banks of Lake Washington in Seattle in the year 2000 and proposed a partnership between the two that would eventually mandate a barrage of different vaccinations by 2020 to every man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They rechristened their effort in 2009 , The Decade of Vaccines .\nThey promised that by 2020 , children , everybody on earth would be vaccinated , not just by one vaccine , but a whole host of vaccines .\nGates is heavily invested in virtually all the companies that make all of these vaccines .\nHe uses his philanthropy ; he calls it philanthro-capitalism because it \u2019 s not really philanthropy .\nHe takes $ 33 billion and shields it from taxes , so we \u2019 re actually paying for his policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to capture control of the global public health policy .\nHe basically owns the WHO .\nHe \u2019 s created a series of quasigovernmental organizations that dictate global health policy Gavi , CEPI , and other ones that he \u2019 s heavily invested in and controls like the Brighton Collaboration .\nHe uses his control of those agencies to require developing nations , Africa , Asia , Latin America , to mandate vaccines to their populations .\nThose countries , for example African countries , are heavily dependent on WHO for the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports their HIV programs .\nWhat Gates and the WHO do is they tell those countries , you have to have a certain amount of uptake for Gates \u2019 polio vaccines , for his DTP vaccines .\nIf , for example , 70 or 80 percent of your population does not get those vaccines , you will not get your health ministry money .\nThe vaccines that they \u2019 re buying are vaccines that are made by companies in which he is personally invested and the Gates Foundation is personally invested .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have actually looked into whether or not those vaccines are saving lives which Gates claims , they found that just the opposite is true .\nFor example , the most popular vaccine in the world , the DTP vaccine , diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis , which Gates had promoted in Africa and Asia for many , many years as life-saving , tens of millions of children .\nWhen the Danish government financed a study in 2017\u2014the Danish government plus the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark\u2026 and another vaccine company financed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of records in Africa , to see how children were doing who had gotten the vaccine compared to children who didn \u2019 t .\nWhat they found was that girls who got that vaccine , while they were protected against diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis , were dying at ten times the rate of unvaccinated girls .\nThe vaccine was protecting them against certain strains of certain infectious diseases , but it had obliterated their immune systems and made them extremely susceptible to minor infections and particularly to respiratory infections .\nMalnutrition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kill many African children , but it turns out they were much less able , the vaccinated children , were much less able to fend off diseases than children whose immune systems had not been tampered with .\nKennedy : Let me add one other thing .\nGates has basically transformed WHO from a development and hygiene and sanitation and economic development agency that it used to be , to an agency that basically does vaccinations .\nFifty percent of WHO \u2019 s budget goes to Gates \u2019 vanity project , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vaccine experts in the world , very pro-vaccine , told him from the beginning , this is not going to work .\nYou are not going to eradicate polio .\nAnd today WHO admits that 70 percent of polio cases in the world today are caused by Gates \u2019 vaccine .\nInstead of obliterating the disease , it \u2019 s actually aggravating the problem .\nIt \u2019 s causing epidemics in countries where polio had been eradicated , like the Congo and Afghanistan and many , many other countries .\nNewman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Associate Press based on WHO data .\nI saw it as well back in November of 2019 .\nSo all of this begs the question , are these people doing this deliberately ?\nAre they evil maniacs ?\nOr is this just well-intentioned , dumb policy , and what do you think their ultimate agenda is ?\nJust to make money ?\nWhat \u2019 s their plan ?\nKennedy : That \u2019 s not a mystery to me .\nThe same motives have incentivized people since the beginning of time , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the promotion of bio-security have basically now supplanted all the other objectives of foreign policy .\nIt was deliberate .\nIt was purposeful .\nIt was promoted by these two men , by Gates and Fauci , but they had many , many allies .\nAs I show in my book , the intelligence agencies are deeply allied with Dr. Fauci and with Bill Gates .\nThey promoted a series of , the CIA actually promoted a series of simulations beginning in 2000 involving hundreds of thousands of people , and Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were always promoted by the intelligence agencies and by also the military and the big pharmaceutical companies .\nThis [ is a ] very , very sinister alignment which I document in the book .\nBy the way , there are 2,200 footnotes in the book .\nEvery sentence that I have , every factual statement , is carefully , carefully documented .\nAnybody can look them up .\nThey promoted these pandemic simulations which trained frontline workers , trained hospital doctors , medical officials , intelligence officials , law enforcement officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , Australia and Canada .\nVirtually every year they would put on these simulations .\nThe simulations were pandemic simulations .\nWhat do you do if a coronavirus pandemic hits ?\nThey had nothing to do with medical responses .\nI published the transcripts in my book .\nThere was no discussion of how to strengthen people \u2019 s immune systems , how to distribute vitamin D or zinc or quercetin or how to repurpose medication , do early treatment , how to quarantine the sick and to protect them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to protect the Bill of Rights .\nNone of that was ever discussed .\nThe only discussion was how do you use a pandemic as a pretense for clamping down , for imposing totalitarian controls and for the controlled demolition of liberal democracy globally .\nThe series of pandemic simulations that they put upon was called Operation Lockstep because it was a way ostensibly coordinating the activities of all the liberal democracies across the globe to suddenly pivot constitutional defenders to censorship , totalitarian controls and the obliteration of constitutional and civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory , but anybody can go on YouTube and look up Event 201 , https : //www.youtube.com/watch ?\nv=AoLw-Q8X174 which is one of the famous ones .\nI was able to find many , many more .\nThis was happening year after year after year .\nEvent 201 takes place in October of 2019 , and at that time coronavirus is already circulating in Wuhan .\nThe best estimate is that it began circulating on September 12 , 2019 .\nThe Chinese already knew about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Event 201 , which is at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan is George Gao , head of the Chinese CDC .\nThe other people there are military people , the social media companies , the big media companies like Bloomberg and Washington Post , the biggest pharmaceutical companies like Johnson and Johnson .\nWho are the hosts ?\nThe hosts are Bill Gates and Avril Haines , the deputy director of the CIA , former deputy director .\nShe \u2019 s now head of Joe Biden \u2019 s National Security Agency .\nShe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the CIA doing in public health ?\nThe CIA does not do public health .\nThey do coup d \u2019 etat .\nThat \u2019 s not a joke .\nThe CIA is documented to have participated in 73 coup d \u2019 etats against most of the democracies or one third of the governments in the world between 1947 and 2000 .\nIf you look back , every year they were doing these pandemic simulations and none of them was about public health .\nThey were all about how to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totalitarian controls and for executing a coup d \u2019 etat against all these global democracies .\nAt every single one of them there is a very , very heavy CIA presence .\nThere \u2019 s sometimes three , four , five top people from In-Q-Tel and from the CIA .\nThey \u2019 re teaching people , training people .\nThere was also always a big shot .\nThere was Madeline Albright for one .\nSenator Gary Hart would be another .\nSenator Sam Nunn , head of the Defense Committee or a congressman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a figurehead .\nThat gives the whole exercise the imprimatur of legitimacy and authority .\nThey were teaching frontline workers , this is how you respond to a pandemic .\nYou lockdown societies , you force people to wear masks , you get rid of democratic processes like due process , there \u2019 s censorship of the press .\nAnyone who wants to can go look up Event 201 , and the fourth seminar that day , the fourth exercise and the longest , is an exercise\u2014this is simulated , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simulating two months before the announcement of COVID-19 , a global coronavirus pandemic .\nWhat are they concerns with ?\nThey \u2019 re concerned with how to get the social media to censor rumors that this is a lab leak .\nThis is what they \u2019 re all talking about in October of 2019 .\nIf you go back to all of these simulations as I do and read my book , the chapter , Germ Games , it details the extraordinary prescience , the kind of soothsaying that occurred where they predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were talking about a decade ago , that this is the endpoint It \u2019 s very , very alarming when you read it .\nNewman : Please just give us a couple of words on what you think we ought to be doing about this .\nWhat \u2019 s the solution to this ?\nIs this a partisan issue ?\nShould we be scared ?\nKennedy : I think the best thing for the oligarchs and for this cartel between the social media companies that are enriching themselves by engorging themselves on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the media companies , the intelligence agencies and the medical technocrats , their strategic intent is to keep Republicans fighting against Democrats and black against whites , to sow division , to orchestrate fear .\nWe \u2019 re going to win this one person at a time , by talking to your neighbors , by convincing people .\nThe conversion rate is always on our side .\nOnce people understand the truth , they \u2019 re never going to go back to the other side .\nWe \u2019 re seeing this huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get to a critical mass , we \u2019 ll be able to retake our democracy , but we need literally to do that one person at a time , that \u2019 s by constantly talking about it , spreading the message .\nI would say one of the ways to do that is to purchase my book , give it to your friends for Christmas .\nI make no money on the book , by the way .\nAll my profits go back to CHD https : //childrenshealthdefense.org/ [

Zahorodny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating new prevalence report .\nDr. Zahorodny is the Principal Investigator of the New Jersey ADDM Network and has been involved with these prevalence reports since their inception in 2000 .\nThe following is a transcript of our discussion .\nThe study , published in the December 3 , 2021 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , uses the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring ( ADDM ) Network to estimate the number of children with ASD and other developmental disabilities living in different areas of the United States .\nThese reports are typically released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied a total of 5058 8-year-old children with ASD in : Arizona , Arkansas , California , Georgia , Maryland , Minnesota , Missouri , New Jersey , Tennessee , Utah , and Wisconsin .\nPrevalence rates ranged from 1.6 % in Missouri to 3.9 % in California .\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) released its latest prevalence estimates for autism .\nThe

reflects a 3.39 fold jump in numbers since the CDC began collecting data in 2000 .\nAutism , is the silent epidemic .\nOr should we say , the silenced epidemic .\nThis is all on Anthony Fauci 's watch .\nAll of it .\nFrom Safeminds : We have spoken to you previously about the high reported rates of autism in New Jersey , but this report shows that California has the highest rate of autism in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think Californian showed the highest rate ?\nI am surprised that California has the highest rate of autism .\nNew Jersey had been the leading indicator of autism prevalence for almost 20 years .\nSince the ADDM Network never conducted autism surveillance in California , no one had an idea of what to expect .\nI think California showed a higher rate because autism is prevalent in the U.S. and when you look carefully in a metropolitan area with good levels of health care and education , you will find high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male to female autism ratio stay constant in this report compared to other reporting periods ?\nWhat is the autism prevalence rate for boys ?\nWhat is the rate for girls ?\nThe ADDM average rate for boys was 3.6 % , and the rate for girls was .8 % .\nBoys outnumber girls by about 4 to 1 , as most previous surveillance shows .\nI \u2019 d call your attention to the fact that the rate of autism among boys in California was 6.4 % , however .\nThat is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring and research .\nDid the prevalence rate in this reporting period stay consistent across ethnicities and races ?\nWere there any disparities or signals discovered ?\nIn most ADDM states , autism prevalence is similar across races .\nIn a few states , Hispanic children with autism were less likely to be identified .\nIt is gratifying that the race/ethnicity disparities in autism identification may be declining in many regions .\nLast October , we spoke to you about a New Jersey report which showed that middle income families showed a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or low income families .\nDid this report look at socioeconomic status ?\nThis is the first time an ADDM report provided information about socioeconomic status ( SES ) .\nIn this regard , the distribution of autism seems to be shifting .\nFor the first ten years of surveillance in New Jersey and throughout the network , autism prevalence estimates were significantly higher in high SES communities .\nThis report no longer shows the positive association of wealth and autism prevalence .\nIn some states , prevalence is highest in low SES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most prevalent in the mid SES communities .\nIt is too early to know whether this shifting continues and what it means .\nThis report was calculated and written during the pandemic .\nDid COVID affect data collection or any other parts to the reporting process ?\nIt is very likely that COVID-19 restrictions affected data collection at some ADDM sites .\nIt is hard to evaluate the overall effect of COVID-19 on our estimates , however .\nWere there any surprises in this report ?\nI am surprised that California has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey had been the leading indicator of autism prevalence for almost 20 years .\nSince the ADDM Network never conducted autism surveillance in California , no one had an idea of what to expect .\nIs there any good news ?\nThe good news is that the ADDM Network now includes a region in California , which will be able to provide high quality prevalence findings going forward .\nWhat is your takeaway from this ADDM report ?\nThis report shows that autism prevalence has increased continuously over twenty years in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 % of children born in 2010 .\nAutism rates have not plateaued and so future estimates are likely to continue upward .\nSince the revised ADDM method is faster , but less comprehensive .\nIt is likely to underestimate the actual number of true cases and may miss children from underserved communities .\nIf autism already affects 4-7 % of 8-year-children in many New Jersey areas as shown in our recent study and 4 % in California according to the new ADDM findings , understanding the factors driving the rise in ASD @ @ @ @ @ @

me just how hard this was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the paperwork stuff , he \u2019 s fully invested in everything else that we need to do for our son .\nWe share everything - the highs and the lows and do what we need to do for Ronan , even when it overwhelms us .\nSo , when more mail came last week that included more reminders of what Ronan still can \u2019 t do , it overwhelmed me a bit all over again .\nThe letter was from an agency we \u2019 d been in contact with immediately after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with intellectual disabilities , I \u2019 d already gone through their mountain of

worker in an email about how ridiculous , time consuming and archaic their system is and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked into another politician 's office asking what he 's going to do about the rising

faster then and made sure we were both very well taken care of , encouraging Ronan and doing everything to comfort him the entire time .\nAs we left , I thanked him and the other medical staff who

strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keep us from crumbling .\nI can \u2019 t always put into words what those people and their kind gestures mean .\nI can , though , tell others about our positive experiences .\nI readily admit that some of this is hard , but I make a point to also speak of the thankful moments .\nI do that in the hopes that others , too , can be filled with something hopeful and with

takes moving mountains for me to get away for a few days .\nSo much work is involved in order to walk out the door that I sometimes wonder if it \u2019 s really worth it to leave .\nSometimes the mountains I have to climb to get out of the house are small ones like piles of laundry .\nOther mountains are more complicated and require extra time to plan .\nThose include \u2018 the everything \u2019 I do all day long with five children , a traveling husband and home schooling .\nI have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when and why .\nI leave a stockpile of all sorts of foods , supplements and supplies for my family when I leave for my multi-day getaway .\nAll of the preparation brings me closer to a conference hundreds of miles away .\nYou \u2019 d think I would have already figured out a better strategy to be fully ready to travel , but it \u2019 s still a lot of work even though this is my third year in a row to attend .\nI haven \u2019 t been to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTime got away from me .\nMy typical kids \u2019 schedules and needs kept me closer to home .\nI would still tap into the AutismOne community as I saw opportunities and made sure to recommend Ed and Teri \u2019 s knowledge to others , especially to the new parents as more online resources became available .\nThat meet up was the first of several conference meet ups .\nI was able to attend AO in 2010 and again 2011 through the generosity of my parents .\nKnowing how important it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sure I got there .\nThey also gifted us the chance for my husband to go with me .\nThose weekends away helped both of us know more about autism .\nThose weekends helped us know better what treatments were currently available , too , and which ones our son might benefit .\nI later shared with Kim that , \u201c So many people were anxious to meet the Age of Autism team and to thank you .\nHanging out the first day \u2013 heck it was the first hour I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Dan was the icing on the cake for my weekend\u2026it had only just started and only got better !\n\u201d I know I was still smiling from ear-to-ear when I wrote her back : I 'll probably bowl you over as I run in there with all my excitement : ) Let me know what the tickets include .\nI would be happy to volunteer if anyone needs a special helper too .\nWhat an opportunity !\nCa n't wait to meet everyone soon .\nAfter getting that email from Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weekend getaway .\nShe and other Age of Autism writers would be attending the event , and I wanted to meet them .\nI \u2019 d read that for autism parents and advocates , this was the biggest and best conference of its kind .\nI , of course , wanted to go .\nBut how ?\nAt the time , I was a stay-at-home mom to five children .\nMy oldest was only 8 years old .\nThe baby was still just a baby .\nFriends had already offered to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room if I could get there .\nOur nanny offered to work longer and be available through the weekend should my husband need any extra help if I could get away .\nThings were falling into place , but the last task was to figure out if I could afford the flight to get half-way across the country to where all the autism action was taking place .\nWith the help of one more friend , I could .\nThat one time of the year that I \u2019 m drawn to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to Chicago for the annual Autism One Generation Rescue conference .\nAs much as it would be easier to stay at my house to manage my family \u2019 s needs , I walk away from them and every responsibility I have .\nI gingerly tiptoe away from Ronan and my all-consuming thoughts I have about his special needs .\nI leave to surround myself with hundreds of strangers who share the same story I do .\nIt \u2019 s the chance for several groups and many individuals in the autism is treatable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us have a strong desire to continue to learn about autism even years after the initial diagnosis .\nThis conference helps us to stay knowledgeable about autism and to understand its future implications for our child and for our family .\nOne of the biggest reasons I like to attend the AutismOne conference besides having a quick break from life is that it reaches beyond a simple layer of autism awareness .\nInstead , this conference offers a several days \u2019 worth of autism action .\nThat is very apparent when looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks that cover many topics in the field .\nThose topics include how to reduce problematic behaviors , how to introduce and maintain dietary intervention as well as how to manage sensory issues are just a few of the helpful topics .\nSome speakers go behind the science of what autism is and then go beyond what autism can do to an individual , their family and their community .\nAs I scan through the titles of the presentations , I \u2019 m reminded that I don \u2019 t know everything my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI feel like I have so much to catch up on and understand .\nI also want to renew my outlook on Ronan \u2019 s life and feel that being at AutismOne can help me with that .\nI can see how my life has changed because of what I already do know about Ronan but as with anything in life it takes effort to keep moving forward .\nAs I circle the presentations of what I want to attend in my conference guide book , I make a new mental game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard ( if not harder ) for Ronan .\nPresentations include autism basics ( what causes it , what it is , how it \u2019 s diagnosed ) .\nMore detailed topics include how to treat the symptoms of autism ( certain therapies , specific interventions and finding providers and/or treatments centers ) .\nAnother layer of lectures goes down different avenues and are as equally important ( legal tracts on special education and vaccine injury ; first responder training ; current autism research and of course , next steps for the autism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Active Healing after his dynamic presentation ( L-R , Heather McLennand , Cat , Sarge , Allison Chapman ) While at the conference I soak in the respite of being away and then immerse myself in as many of the presentations as I can .\nAfter a few talks , I feel like I \u2019 m back in college cramming for a final exam -- I simply must learn everything .\nI take as many notes as I can scratch out on a notepad .\nMy hand starts to cramp as I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look up .\nIn the back of my head I wonder if I missed something in my earlier research about Ronan , about vaccine injury or about autism so long ago .\nThere are only a few moments to dwell on those What Ifs so I continue to take notes and get ready to move onto the next speech or event .\nOnce I \u2019 m out of the mind-numbing presentations I think to myself not only do I feel like I must I learn everything , I must be able to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs once I return home .\nDepending on which tract I am following , some of the presentations I sit through bring me to my knees in emotional agony .\nI feel waves of sadness , regret , horror , disgust and then the worst of all emotions : fear .\nWendy Fournier of the National Autism Association gave a very moving presentation about wandering which hit home for me because Ronan has wandered into dangerous situations before .\nI can \u2019 t remember how many times I cried during her talk but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fear into anger .\nI was angry as to why this all happened to Ronan in the first place .\nI was angry at why it takes so long to get things done to give Ronan the chance to succeed .\nI was angry at why we parents continue to have to fight so hard for our kids .\nI know I \u2019 m not the only one who has had a plea for help fall on deaf ears time and time again .\nThat simple request for help later becomes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during her talk , Wendy said , \u201c We need help.\n\u201d That statement wasn \u2019 t addressed to the parents in the audience but out to the communities we live .\nWork needs to be done to ensure proper care for our children , and it \u2019 s needs to be a group effort to find that help .\nAutismOne is a place to gather some of those people who give directly back to the families like mine .\nBecause so many groups are represented during the conference , I appreciate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to say hello , to share Ronan \u2019 s story and to say thank you .\nPutting the heavy emotions behind me after Wendy \u2019 s talk was hard because AutismOne is full of reality .\nMost of Ronan \u2019 s care is a struggle .\nHe makes great progress and I \u2019 m thankful , but it \u2019 s slow going , sometimes painful and not always consistent .\nNot only do I have to balance his emotions which includes frustration because he is so determined yet falls behind , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in check .\nIf I \u2019 m not physically , mentally or spiritually strong , I can \u2019 t fully provide for him .\nFortunately , other presentations at the conference do draw out positive and refreshing emotions .\nI listened to people who have discovered the road to recovery .\nI hear that in the corridors as I listened to people share their own child \u2019 s success\u2014school success gained by following a certain therapy .\nGI healing success as they are now able to eat typical foods .\nPhysical success as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in group sports or able to hang out with typical peers .\nKnowing that other people have pushed through troubling symptoms gives me hope that Ronan can also find his own successes as he recovers .\nOne thing I found most inspirational while I was away was when I heard some people realize their child was farther on the journey to recovery than they previous thought .\nThey discovered this after attending a few days of the presentation and recognized that the intense signs , symptoms and issues of autism no longer related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that feeling and am so very thankful that their years \u2019 worth of work for their child brought them to their current healthy status .\nOther attendees I ran into are on their last leg of what has been a long journey to being recovered .\nHow great that their child is more stable , healthy and typical again !\nBeing able to relax for part of the trip is a must .\nGoing to Chicago gives me a chance to get away from the daily reminders of what is and isn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step out of my head , relieve myself of my daily worries and then refresh myself to return home with renewed hope .\nI enjoy mingling in the hallways in the main hotel lobby as conference goers pass from one presentation to the next .\nA constant buzz of excitement fills the air as does learning , networking and socializing .\nPart of all of us being in one place at the same time reminds us that we have the same desires\u2014that is to help our children be successful , healthy and accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next family who finds themselves with a child on the autism spectrum .\nMy purse is prettier than your purse .\nThe entire weekend is full of helpful talks , resourceful exhibits and it includes a wide range of emotion .\nSpecial events are scheduled to remind us that we too need to take care of ourselves in the midst of caring for our family .\nOne of the biggest reminders that I am still me is when I meet up with old friends I \u2019 ve met while walking with Ronan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me during the year when I back home feeling miles and miles away from AutismOne .\nAs I struggle to understand another problem my son has to overcome , I call upon my team of friends to give advice , ot offer a shoulder to cry on or an ear to listen .\nThe closeness we feel even miles and miles away or behind a computer screen as we email , Skype or Facebook together is made even closer when we meet up in Chicago .\nThis is a highlight that I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks to the conference .\nIt also reminds me of how I much I look forward to the feeling of a big family reunion .\nWe are family .\nWe come together as a unit .\nAs the AutismOne conference wraps up I wish I could rewind the clock just a few hours so I can make sure I can see , hear , meet or grab one of everything and everyone .\nCat and her best buddy Dr. Sarah Stockwell , Ph.D. reconnecting again .\nIt 's a huge rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally huge of a race to get home .\nUpon departure from the long weekend many are thinking about everyone they left behind at home : spouses , children-both typical and affected , caregivers and relatives .\nAll have pitched in to make our getaway a success .\nAs I cram hundreds of pages of brochures , lecture notes , handouts and new friends \u2019 contact information in my suitcase my thoughts turn back toward my family .\nWhile I \u2019 m sure everyone at home is okay without me I \u2019 m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did my husband manage the dietary needs ?\nWere meds and supplements administered on time ?\nDid everyone get along ?\nWas everything easy peasy lemon squeezy so that next year I can sneak away on this now annual trek to the Windy City for another much-needed getaway ?\nOnce I get through the maze of airport security and sit in my seat on the plane , the only thing I \u2019 m able to do is stare out the window .\nForget reading my notes or any of the literature I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mind is overloaded with too much at this point so I just sit back and relax a little bit more .\nI \u2019 ll be home soon enough and will have to embrace the fast-paced life of taking care of my family on my own once again .\nI travel a few hours on the flight which gives me more thinking time .\nI \u2019 ve just left the biggest group hug I \u2019 ve ever encountered in a long time .\nOn the flight home and on the drive to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than everything I \u2019 ve just experience , I slowly come off of the AutismOne conference high .\nAfter talking with a few friends on the way home we \u2019 re all sharing the same feelings -- from start to finish , we went from high energy and pure joy to an emotional crash .\nRe-entering my every-day life makes me realize two things : I see how much work I 've done already for my child and I fear how much more is yet to be accomplished to get to true recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had while away , and because of the thousands of steps I took walking back and forth and all over the hotel , all I want to do is fall into my own bed when I get home .\nI end up unpacking a few of the items from my bags though\u2014the must read books and handouts go on my nightstand .\nI leave my hand-written notes from the lectures by the computer so I can look up key words or phrases .\nI enter friends \u2019 contact info into my address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helpful friendships active .\nLastly , I leave my camera out so I scan through the few pictures I was able to take of friends old and new to remind myself that I am certainly not alone on this journey .\nI can \u2019 t help but think about how much I have done already for Ronan while I \u2019 m unpacking all the new items I gathered at from AutismOne .\nI think about how much more I want to do when I am next awake .\nI reflect on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the support we have been given .\nI know I need to consider what needs to be changed for Ronan to make his next days better .\nEven though some of the experiences at the conference were overwhelming , I greet the challenge of coming home to my own reality now that I feel refreshed from a quick getaway .\nThe energy it took to get ready to go to Chicago is something I want to maintain once I return to my routine .\nIt takes every bit of energy I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my days .\nWith that positive strength I feel I can embrace my own reality .\nIt includes more than just me feeling like I can do things for Ronan ; it includes watching my little boy grow up to be a recovered , healthy and happy child .\nCathy Jameson is a Contributing Editor for Age of Autism .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

agencies call Stockholm syndrome which makes people grateful to their captors and leaves them with the feeling that their only path to survival is total compliance and total obedience to the captors ,

virus pandemic simulations that the intelligence agencies were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concerned , Kennedy revealed that under Fauci \u2019 s watch , plans to handle a pandemic had been in the works for years .\nAs a result , there is essentially no oversight : \u201c So the whole system is now corrupt .\nEvery aspect of it has been has been completely corrupted by pharma.\n\u201d Kennedy explained how Fauci joined forces with the pharmaceutical industry to the point , as Kennedy said , \u201c He is a partner in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\u201d This includes dispensing research dollars to universities .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ power over research and funding from the U.S. Government .\nKennedy explained that Fauci has never been held accountable for promoting the unproven , deadly drug , AZT for AIDS patients .\nAs Kennedy put it , \u201c He captured the AIDS crisis for his agency \u201d in order to gain access to billions of research dollars , and \u201c that really was the beginning of his power.\n\u201d During the 28 minute talk Kennedy revealed the lengths Fauci went to in order to turn his agency , NIAID , the National Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a backwater entity , set to be abolished , into a powerful force controlling our public health decisions .\nGod bless our Anne Dachel , the transcription Queen .\nShe took the time to write out Robert Kennedy 's 28 minute

terms of mass marketing .\nThe one place where we can still do mass marketing to large swaths of people in public are books , and this book I think , is really important because it \u2019 s an explanation , a fact-based explanation about what happened to our country in the last 20 months .\nThe evolution of agency capture , the evolution of the links between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies , the medical technocrats led by Tony Fauci , but also these other players that now play such a critical role in that medical cartel , including the social media and the mainstream media outlets which both have their own financial entanglements with Big Pharma and probably most importantly , the intelligence agencies .\nThat was an ingredient that I really didn \u2019 t understand .\nI had seen kind of these vague shadows of their presence , not really understanding how it happened or why they were interested in public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story\u2014still much of it is obscure\u2014but it become clearer and clearer and clearer , and their fingerprint on the COVID pandemic response is now indelible and clear and undeniable , and it \u2019 s frightening .\nParticularly , the last chapter of my book , the chapter called \u201c Germ Games , \u201d really drills down on those entanglements by the CIA , by the other intelligence agencies and by the military intelligence agencies as well .\nRohde : I got your book last week\u2026 One of the things I was picking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HIV community through the AIDS .\nI thought it was purely disgusting .\nWhat are one or two takeaways that you could tell the listeners with regards to the HIV , AIDS era\u2014I guess he was promoting antivirals there at the end .\nI find the whole things disgusting , what he did to the entire HIV community .\nKennedy : I show this in the book\u2026.He pioneered techniques and methodologies that we \u2019 ve seen him enact or that we \u2019 ve seen him execute again and again and again\u2014that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote toxic drugs , high profit toxic drugs over much more effective off-the-shelf , repurposed medications that are actually more effective .\nThere were all the same techniques that he used .\nHere \u2019 s the story .\nNIAID in 1981 was a backwater .\nIt was an agency that had originally targeted infectious diseases , [ but ] as infectious disease mortality has declined in our country , it became much less relevant .\nIn fact in 1980 , David Stockman , Ronald Reagan \u2019 s budget director , recommended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infectious disease had declined to such a small percentage of the American public that it was no longer a significant cause of mortality .\nThis was because of improved nutrition , improved sanitation , the road systems , electric refrigeration and flush toilets , etc There was desperation within the agencies , actually there were memos going back and forth saying we \u2019 ve got to find a pandemic because it \u2019 s the only way that we can save our agency .\nIn 1981 , the first AIDS cases appeared , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey didn \u2019 t go to NIAID .\nThe National Cancer Institute is another HHS agency , and they went there because the original signal for AIDS was Kaposi Sarcoma , which is a skin cancer and it affects other areas of the body too .\nAnd so it was regarded as a cancer problem , and the National Cancer Institute was set up actually , it had laboratories , it could do laboratory analyses , it could do large scale studies .\nIt could not only identify the cases of disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs .\nIt had a laboratory to develop cancer drugs .\nBillions and billions of dollars had been poured into that laboratory .\nIt was state of the art .\nTony Fauci had none of that .\nNIAID was a tiny little agency with a minuscule budget , constantly under threat , and it had no capacity to make drugs .\nTony Fauci had a battle with National Cancer Institute .\nIn 1983 Luc Montagnier found an organism in about 47 percent of AIDS patients he examined , which was the HIV organism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done to see if this has a causative impact on AIDS .\nFauci used that study , which was very ambiguous , to say this is a viral disease .\nIt is therefore in my jurisdiction and not under the jurisdiction of the National Cancer Institute .\nHe captured the AIDS crisis for his agency .\nAt that time it was billions of dollars in funding that were being poured into this new plague , which was predicted to spread across the population\u2014which of course , it never did .\nThat really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that time , he had no clue about how to develop a drug because all those kinds of experiments , all those kinds of developments were what was happening at National Cancer Institute .\nNIAID was not equipped to do that .\nHe was promising Congress and promising the AIDS activists , yes , we can get you a drug very quickly , but he couldn \u2019 t do it .\nSo he was utterly reliant on the pharmaceutical industry to produce a product for him .\nThe only product at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AZT .\nNow AZT was a highly , highly toxic human therapy drug .\nIn fact it was so toxic\u2014 it was originally developed by NIH .\nThe scientists who developed it threw it on a junk heap because it killed all the mice .\nChemotherapy drugs are designed to kill you .\nThey \u2019 re designed to kill every cell in your body , but the hope is that they \u2019 ll kill the tumor cells before they kill the rest of you .\nThis drug was just plain deadly .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any use for it , but very , very early on in the process , Glaxo began doing experiments with a lot of compounds .\nIt took AZT and put it in a cell culture with HIV , and it killed the HIV , naturally , because it kills everything .\nSo they said , this may be useful as an AIDS drug .\nThey began planning to do clinical trials on it .\nTony Fauci facilitated those clinical trials without doing proper animal studies .\nThe problem was it was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem was when they started giving this to people , they immediately died .\nSo Tony Fauci had to end the trial after eight weeks , instead of going two to three years , which it should have gone .\nThe only way he could keep the patients alive during that period was to give many of them daily blood transfusions .\nSo they were giving almost no blood transfusions to the placebo group , and they were giving blood transfusions to almost everybody in the AZT group .\nThat way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period .\nHe declared it a huge success .\nHe said , now we \u2019 re going to give this not just to people who are sick with AIDS ; we \u2019 re going to give it to anybody who tests positive for AZTwith a PCR test .\nWith chemotherapy you give people the drug for two weeks and hope it kills the tumor .\nWhat Tony Fauci was planning to do was to give AZT to people for the rest of their lives .\nIf you give a chemotherapy drug to somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is going to end their life quickly .\nThat \u2019 s what happened , and AZT ended up killing a lot more people than AIDS killed .\nNews reports on NBC and all over the country about the cheating that had been discovered in the upcoming years , but \u201c Teflon Tony \u201d was able to deflect those .\nThat really is one of this big gifts , his capacity to not get implicated in the disasters that have followed him throughout his career .\nAZT became a huge success .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGlaxo was selling it for $ 10,000 per year .\n\u2026The capitalization of the company essentially doubled overnight .\nThere were a lot of critics who came forward and said , wait a minute , this is poison .\nIt \u2019 s not really working .\nThose critics , what I show in the book , the strategies he developed for silencing , for censoring , for discrediting , for marginalizing , for vilifying those critics were techniques that he then used throughout the rest of his career .\nThose techniques really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a career that has been marked by dramatic declines in American health and by the corruption of science across the board , because he now controls most of the science .\nNIAID is no longer even a public health agency .\nIt \u2019 s simply an incubator for pharmaceutical products .\nSo between 2009 and 2016 , there were some 240 drugs that were approved by FDA , all of which had gone through Tony Fauci \u2019 s shop .\nHe is a partner in the pharmaceutical industry .\nClassically , Wayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has laboratories now where his NIAID researchers have tens of thousands of cultures of every viral disease\u2026 .\nThey \u2019 ll take different molecules , different combinations of molecules and drip them on to the virus culture .\nIf the virus dies , they have a potential drug .\nIt \u2019 s an anti-viral .\nThen they \u2019 ll test it on mice or rodents or guinea pigs , and they \u2019 ll see if it kills the animals .\nIf it kills the virus , but it does not wipe out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potential drug .\nThey can begin farming it out .\nThey \u2019 ll farm it out to a university to do clinical trials , first on animals , then phrase one trials .\nThis is the way the clinical trials , a typical way they work , although it \u2019 s far from a uniform way they work .\nThe principal investigator who \u2019 s unusually the head of a department at a university medical school , and he is making the bulk of his money and the university is now making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and NIAID .\nTypically the bad PI [ principal investigator ] will have 100 people in the study .\nHe \u2019 s a doctor ; he \u2019 ll be recruiting volunteers for the study .\nNIAID will give the PI let \u2019 s say $ 15,000 for every individual in his study .\nThe university skims off 50-75 percent of that to keep .\nThat means the university is now onboard in this partnership , and they \u2019 re part of it , and they \u2019 re going to defend Tony Facui to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase two and phase three .\nNow they have to bring in 10,000 or 20,000 people , so they need a pharmaceutical partner .\nSo they give the patent to a pharmaceutical company , but Tony Fauci is allowed to keep part of that patent for his agency .\nWith the Moderna patent , they kept half of it .\nHe takes parts of that patent and gives them to his favorite deputies .\nWith Moderna , there are at least four people in NIAID who will have margin rights for that patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their HHS policies $ 150,000 a year for life on every patent that they own .\nThat \u2019 s how he keeps the loyalties of his underlings , because he can distribute these little sinecures to them .\nThen the university also keeps part of the patent , so now they get permanent income as long as this is approved .\nOnce they get the drug where they \u2019 ve passed these phase three trials , of course everybody is highly incentivized to cheat , not notice when there \u2019 s injuries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now it has to go to FDA for approval .\nTony Fauci always says , well the drug was approved by independent scientists , but if you look at the scientists who sit on that committee , they aren \u2019 t FDA employees .\nIt \u2019 s a panel that FDA creates , but it creates those panels mainly out of Tony Fauci \u2019 s PIs .\nAll of his PIs from Harvard , from Baylor , from Berkeley , from Stamford , from Columbia , all the other universities sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s drugs .\nAnd if they ever dared not to approve a drug , they \u2019 re never presumably , ever going to get another grant from Tony Fauci , and they live on his grants .\nThe grants are huge .\nTypically he \u2019 ll give $ 200,000,000 .\n$ 300,000,000 in grants to these universities annually .\nSo the whole system becomes corrupt and the pharmaceutical company that owns it also is the major source of funding for the journal , JAMA , the New England Journal of Medicine or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 percent of their revenue from advertising and from reprints from these pharmaceutical companies .\nThe pharmaceutical companies can dictate what gets published .\nThey publish the clinical trial saying this drug works great , and then they buy reprints of that trial in the Lancet with the Lancet masthead on it and distribute it to every doctor in America .\nTheir pharmaceutical reps , when they go visit the doctor now have that Lancet [ article ] .\nSo the whole system is now corrupt .\nEvery aspect of it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony Fauci will never tell you , I \u2019 ve been a great success because Americans are healthier since I came here .\nWhen he came into office , six percent of Americans had chronic disease ; by 2006 , 54 percent .\nHis job is to prevent that , to find out what exposures are causing the chronic diseases and then ending them .\nHe doesn \u2019 t do that .\nHe has a $ 7.7 billion annual budget .\nHe gives twice away a year what Bill Gates gives .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe will never tell you , here is the mark of my success , Americans have less diabetes , they have less rheumatoid arthritis , theyhave fewer food allergies , less eczema , less neurological disorders .\nHe never talks about that .\nThey only thing he talks about is how many vaccines he \u2019 s given and the uptake on all the drugs that he \u2019 s developed .\nRohde : \u2026The last couple of weeks we \u2019 ve heard a lot of noise about small pox .\nI was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germ Games \u201d and intelligence agencies are we going to see something start happening here ?\nOr is this just gas lighting the public for some more fear regarding small pox ?\nI see some posts out there on social media .\nWhat do you think is happening there ?\nKennedy : I can \u2019 t make predictions about what their next move will be .\n\u2026 If you read \u201c Germ Games , \u201d the anthrax attack and the anthrax germ game , about two months earlier .\nIn fact that germ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anthrax attacks took place , there were actually hearings that day in Congress on anthrax attacks .\nBefore COVID there were a whole series of corona virus pandemic simulations that the intelligence agencies were doing .\nThis tendency they have of telegraphing and telling us what \u2019 s going to happen next makes me worry when they say , well , now we have to prepare for small pox .\nTwo days later we find a bunch of vials of small pox in one NIH lab .\nSo it is worrying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 re being manipulated .\nWe know that they using all of this manipulated data , they \u2019 re using all the alchemies of fear , panic , isolation , all of the games of the intelligence agencies , the techniques that the intelligence agencies have used for many , many years .\nThey \u2019 re manipulating populations on a national scale .\nAll that propaganda , the fear mongering , the scapegoating , the isolation tactics , the lockdowns to induce this system that the intelligence agencies call Stockholm syndrome which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves them with the feeling that their only path to survival is total compliance and total obedience to the captors , anger at people who anger the captors\u2014and all of these techniques that I talk about .\nThere \u2019 s many , many more that the CIA developed through MK-Ultra .\nI show how those are tied directly into manipulations that have occurred through since the beginning , and how the planning for this happened over 20 years where they were drilling it again and again and again .\nTo someone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a crazy conspiracy theorist , but there \u2019 s 2,200 footnotes in the book .\nI don \u2019 t make any speculations .\nI don \u2019 t look in people \u2019 s heads .\nI don \u2019 t look into Gates \u2019 head or Tony Fauci \u2019 s head and say this is what he was thinking .\nI don \u2019 t do that .\nI only tell this story as it can be documented .\nThat story , I think , is revealing about the people who \u2019 ve put us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to thank you for your extraordinary work .\nYou are an invaluable resource to this entire movement , this entire community .\nYour choice in really studying the VAERS system has allowed those of us who are litigating on this issue and advocating too , a deeper profound insight that \u2019 s been useful to us again and again and again .\nYou \u2019 re the go-to guy .\nSo Wayne , thank you for everything that you do .\nRohde : I truly appreciate that and thank you very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the podcast

the scheduler that the next available dates Ronan could be seen happened to fall on two date that I had absolutely nothing scheduled spoke volumes to me .\nI had to say yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 for Ronan , for my typical kids , for me \u2013 will still be heavy .\nBut if I don \u2019 t give Ronan the opportunity to try , try again I know I \u2019 ll regret it .\nThe kids even said they \u2019 d regret not giving their brother the chance to do something potentially positive .\nSo , this week , we are going to try something that \u2019 s only been an idea .\nI \u2019 ve told myself I wo n't know if it 's the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first step forward and then take the next one after that .\nWe ask him to do that frequently .\n\u2026which gives us a chance to rally together .\nHey , bud .\nLet 's try it again .\nSuccess , for him , is measured in tiny increments .\nThat success is celebrated instantly and fuels the reason to take a second step forward .\nIt gives all of us such joy to see .\nIt gives me the courage to think outside the box again and to rearrange life one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI \u2019 m excited for the possibility to do one more thing for my son .\nEven so , because of past experiences , I have some lingering doubts : It may help him .\nIt may not .\nIt may serve him and us well .\nBut I won \u2019 t know \u2013 we won \u2019 t know \u2013 until we try .\nLike other parents , of both typical children and of children with special needs , I have done or said things that I wish I could take back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the door and down the street if I wanted to write them all down .\nBut this week , I \u2019 m choosing to focus on possibilities instead .\nWith Christmas just around the corner , this could \u2019 ve been the worst week ever to schedule something new to do .\nSchool \u2019 s out , though , and we have nothing else to run to .\nIt \u2019 s actually the perfect week ever .\nSo I \u2019 ll hope for some Christmas blessings instead of dwelling on \u2018 what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what should \u2019 ve beens \u2019 .\nLife \u2019 s a little better when I remember to pull myself out of the past and look hopefully to the future .\nAnd should we find the tiniest bit of success as we forge ahead , you \u2019 ll be some of the first to know how things went .\n\u201c I will honour Christmas in my heart , and try to keep it all the year .\nI will live in the Past , the Present , and the Future .\nThe Spirits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will not shut out the lessons that they teach.\n\u201d Cathy Jameson is a Contributing Editor for

of 451,000 .\nThe first 500 pages have been released from the drug manufacturer , and to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from TrialSite News , https : //trialsitenews.com/ Sonia Elijah .\n\u2026Let \u2019 s talk about the insane response from the FDA and how long they actually want to make this information public .\nCan you take us through the timeframe ?\nSonia Elijah : Around August 23rd , the FDA licensed the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for individuals aged 16 and over .\nThen a large group of about 30 scientists and academics filed a Freedom of Information Act request a few days later , requesting to see all the documentation that the FDA relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emergency use authorization of the vaccine .\nUnder FOIA law , Freedom of Information Act law , the 1967 law , an agency has up to 20 days , within 20 business days to determine whether they \u2019 re going to comply with the request .\nIt took the FDA , I think it was around November 20th when they did release the first batch of documents , and what they released with less than one percent of the actual documentation they have .\nThey have up to 471,000 pages .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded that they were going to release at a rate of 500 pages a month .\nThat would take them to 2076 to release all the documentation .\nThey then came back and said , actually we \u2019 ve got additional pages , it \u2019 s going to take us up to 2096 to release all the information to the public .\nSo it \u2019 s really shocking .\nPreston : Given that this has been rolled out at such a large scale , we should be getting this information as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 years is nowhere near the kind of timeframe .\nWhat \u2019 s the usual turnaround time for a Freedom of Information Act request ?\nElijah : It \u2019 s about 20 business days that an agency determines whether to comply with the request , 20 business days .\nPreston : In terms of the delivery of the actual documentation though , is that something that we can usually see for that size of information ?\nIt \u2019 s probably not something we \u2019 ve dealt with too many times in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages and documentation .\nWhen we \u2019 re seeing such things as maybe like a hundred thousand pages , what \u2019 s typically the turnaround period ?\nIs that maybe a month after that request has been lodged ?\nElijah : Well I know they can do a lot better than 500 pages a month .\nSo they \u2019 re literally at a snail pace .\nThey \u2019 re dragging their feet .\nThey \u2019 re doing all they can to sort of prolong the time to do it .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , the public deserves to know , and the FDA needs to work a lot harder to facilitate the FOIA request .\nPreston : Let \u2019 s look squarely at the first 500 pages itself .\nWhat generally is covered in this first release and what time period does it tend to focus on in terms of the approval process ?\nElijah : So the analysis that I did , I targeted a specific document called The Cumulative Analysis of Post-authorization Adverse Event Reports of the Pfizer vaccine , and that covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it was given emergency use authorization , to February 28 , 2021 .\nThat \u2019 s a 3 month period that we \u2019 re talking about .\nThere \u2019 s a lot you can actually glean from this document even though there are many unknowns .\nIt is a redacted document , unfortunately .\nThough we don \u2019 t know the number of total doses given , then we can \u2019 t calculate the incidence rate .\nBut what we do know is that about 1,228 deaths were recorded in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] is very alarming because you have the former chief medical officer of Pfizer talking to the Washington Journal around April of this year saying that there \u2019 d been no deaths recorded directly because of the vaccine , and that no corners were cut .\nThat \u2019 s sort of quite shocking when we know that this document was produced\u2014well the cutoff period was February 28th of this year .\nThen we have the astounding number of adverse events .\nWe \u2019 re talking about over 40,000 adverse events were recorded .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual , actually\u2014I make a mistake\u201440,000 individual cases , so for the individuals reporting , and then 150,000 events , meaning sort of symptoms .\nIn one case you could have various symptoms , three or four symptoms connected to an individual .\nPreston : According to the document , how closely linked to the COVID vaccine from Pfizer are those actual adverse events ?\nIs there a direct correlation according to this report ?\nElijah : What is interesting , because they give us some statistics , they talk about , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a lot of these event outcomes , the median value is less than 24 hours .\nSo that \u2019 s from the time a person has taken that vaccine to the actual adverse event occurring is less than 24 hours .\nThen you have , for example , the category of anaphylaxis , you have nine recorded deaths , and out of the nine deaths , four deaths occurred on the same day that the individuals took the vaccine .\nSo that gives a very strong indication of vaccine death causality .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ close connection based on , especially as you say , four in the same day .\nFrom this report as well , that I \u2019 ve seen with what you \u2019 ve done with TrialSite News , it also appears that women are actually disproportionately affected by the drug .\nWhat can you tell us about that ?\nElijah : It \u2019 s really alarming to see that literally across the board in all categories of adverse events , you \u2019 re seeing women three times more affected by these adverse events .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ category of anaphylaxis .\nYou have women eight times being more affected by that adverse event .\nThat \u2019 s very alarming .\nIt sort of reveals there \u2019 s a gender specific vaccine safety risk going on here .\nWhat is also very alarming is that throughout this document , Pfiser says there \u2019 s no new safety risks recorded .\nSo there \u2019 s like nothing new to report here .\nSo it \u2019 s all sort of brushed under carpet .\nPreston : I know one thing we \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there \u2019 s been a bit of hesitation from our GPs and other physicians who have suggested if you are looking to have children soon , if you are pregnant , then you shouldn \u2019 t be taking the vaccine .\nWhat \u2019 s been the scenario over in the U.K. , for example ?\nIt that a similar situation ?\nElijah : I think pregnant women are encouraged to take the vaccine here as sort of protect yourself , protect your unborn child .\nIt \u2019 s very concerning because in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called missing information\u2026 It \u2019 s what was missing in the original package that was sent to the FDA .\nWhat I have analyzed , what I \u2019 ve done report on , it \u2019 s sort of like an amended version of what Pfizer has given to the FDA .\nSo they sort of include now the missing information which is to do with pregnancy and lactation .\nYou have adverse events happening there .\nYou have spontaneous abortions and premature births and neonatal deaths .\nPreston : Spontaneous abortions .\nCan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more detail ?\nWhat exactly does that entail ?\nIs this pregnancies that were otherwise completely healthy until this point ?\nElijah : Yes , so it \u2019 s sort of a pregnant mother having a miscarriage .\nIt \u2019 s very alarming .\nPreston : This is sort of in that same 24 hour period ?\nWhat \u2019 s the period we \u2019 re looking at for this data set ?\nElijah : I \u2019 m actually just looking at , so for the pregnant\u2014it \u2019 s quite a long report I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the data basically for that , but I remember there were about 270 unusual pregnancies , and there were about 25 spontaneous abortions from what I remember .\nAnd we \u2019 re talking about a 3 month time period here , and as we know we are coming up to a

all adverse events have been minor in nature , at least according to Pfizer \u2019 s documentation , but does the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a different picture from this report ?\nElijah : Yes , it does because I would say a significant portion of cases are classified as serious cases , and a serious case is one that results in either hospitalization or a life-threatening consequence like death

about is that there really is no informed consent going on because the general public do not know the whole list of side effects that they can get from taking this experimental , mRNA-based vaccine .\nAnd especially for the younger age cohorts , where the risks of taking this vaccine overwhelmingly outweigh the benefits .\nWe \u2019 re talking about COVID or this virus which has an infection

shark attacks along the crowded Jersey shore that sweltering summer of 1916 that caused sensational press coverage and became fodder for Jaws 60 years later ; U.S. entry into WW I in 1917 ; and the Influenza Pandemic that killed 2,157 New York City residents in the week of November 1 , 1918 , alone -- the epidemic has faded from collective memory .\nBut the question remains , and it remains important , because while the worldwide eradication effort makes slow progress , related viruses like EV-68 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. -- are surfacing , and other diseases with similar characteristics are waiting for their moment .\nSo this series asks : What set off the Explosion of 1916 ?\nWhy did n't it spread like that again till after World War II ?\nThis work picks picks up on reporting Mark Blaxill and I conducted over a number of years and first set out in our Age of Polio series in 2011 .\nWe decided to focus next on a single polio outbreak to see if we could find evidence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction of the virus with novel environmental toxins .\nSo this is a logical step -- from the global to the granular , from broad strokes to a concrete case study -- but also a risky one , because it can easily devolve into the dreaded \u201c confirmation bias \u201d and \u201c availability cascade \u201d where everything seems to point toward one \u2019 s own pre-conceived idea .\nI \u2019 m sure that if I looked hard enough I could connect rats with insects with milk with horse stables in just about every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes , frantically scrutinized in 1916 , now occupy orderly manila envelopes at the American Philosophical Society library in Philadelphia , where the New York Department of Health \u2019 s contact-tracing records have , fortunately , been preserved .\n( None appears to have played a significant role in polio outbreaks . )\nThis report reflects our overall mission of looking for the hidden causes of modern illness .\nWe believe those causes are not exclusively microbes -- the 20th century model -- but also environmental toxins about which mainstream science and medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe need better models of what causes mysterious illnesses from autism to polio to schizophrenia .\nFor all those and more , there is evidence for an environmental role .\nBut because that role is usually missed or even suppressed , nothing is learned before the next contagion explodes onto the scene and medicine resorts once more to a war on the virus alone .\nTo understand modern illness , in short , we need to finally understand polio .\nWhat set off the Explosion of 1916 ?\nIf I 'm right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the worst possible place at the worst possible time set it off , the impact spreading with a smooth but terrible precision like ripples from a pebble dropped into a still volcanic lake .\nOn May 23 , Lettie Caruso died .\nShe was an only child .\nThe cause of death was listed as \u201c fatal pneumonia.\n\u201d Soon there was more sickness and death in the building .\nAt some point in May , \u201c there was a woman living on the top floor of the house over her [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose baby was taken ill and died suddenly .\n\u2026 The doctor was an Italian and never told the mother the cause of the baby \u2019 s death.\n\u201d Based on another report in the file , this second infant was probably a male named Peter : \u201c After an illness of 4 days , Peter Pinchero of 1295 Gates Ave. died on May 24th .\nEight days before he was taken ill , his cousin , living at the same address , had also died following a similar illness of about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprecise reference to Lettie . )\nContact tracing , as it 's called , was not an easy task , as the jumble of interviews and observations in Lettie 's file attest a century later .\nBetween the language barrier in this Italian neighborhood , the poverty , and especially the fear that health officials might take children away , the truth comes out in dribs and drabs and even then remains incomplete .\nChildren get sick and die , their heartbroken and terrified families move away , someone remembers and someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the health workers exhibit much empathy , calling their clients `` suspicious and ignorant .

''\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later in the monograph , he derided such speculation with a Puritan \u2019 s version of LMFAO !\nDr. Emerson : \u201c It may not add to the sum of scientific data to quote the suggestions received by the Department of Health as to the cause and means of curing or preventing poliomyelitis ;

Eckart reaped other benefits that went with being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In vivid contrast to his former life as an experiment station official , he lived in a mansion two miles from the Olaa plantation office .\nA book about a subsequent Hawaiian sugar strike by Masayo Umezawa Duus captures the world that awaited him as he approached for the first time his new home with its immense veranda , stables for riding horses , and distant view of the Pacific .\n`` The mansion still stands , \u201d Duus wrote in 1987 , \u201c its landmark a huge banyan tree that is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chieftans held power

itself .\nThe manpower required to keep ahead of them over the two-year growing season threatened whatever profit the plantation might eke out .\nAt the experiment station , Eckart and a fellow researcher , H.P .\nAgee , had been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New method of weed control , \u201d the journal Sugar reported in June 1915 , after that solution had been widely implemented on Olaa \u2019 s sugarcane fields .\n\u201c The system which would appear to be the most satisfactory is that of Agee and Eckart , in which the weeds are sprayed with arsenite of soda .\nTwo special spraying apparatus have been invented , the spread sprayer and the knapsack sprayer.\n\u201d Early concerns about the method had been alleviated , the article said .\nOne was whether the arsenic would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 and not just the weeds .\nIt didn \u2019 t : \u201c Experiments carried out in Olaa , in which arsenic was applied to the soil between the rows at the rate of 5 lbs .\nper acre each week for six months , showed that the arsenic had no injurious effect on the growth of the cane plant.\n\u201d If you think the second issue might be whether the arsenic posed any problem for those who would ultimately ingest the sugar in New York , Philadelphia , and Boston \u2013 you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , as to whether the poison employed in the process damages the cane itself , has also been answered in the negative .\nIt is true that , even with the best apparatus , small quantities of the spray can not be prevented from coming into contact with the leaves of the young cane occasionally .\nBut this is not a matter of importance , because it is at most occasions a slight check to the cane , from which it recovers entirely within a few weeks.\n\u201d What a relief \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYou could spray thousands of gallons of an arsenic solution on fields for two years and still harvest a healthy crop .\nSure , a lot of arsenic got into the sloping , rain-soaked soil , and who could help sloshing a little onto the sugarcane plant from time to time ?\nMeanwhile , the dead weeds were left where they lay to decompose .\nThe point was , the plant recovered .\nIt was not a matter of importance .\nHere we are , then , in June 1915 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 ever , anywhere , as far as I can tell \u2013 on a sugarcane crop .\n\u201c It may be said that this method of weed control already has passed the experimental stage , \u201d the article stated , \u201c as it has been adopted as a part of the normal field work in the extensive plantation at Olaa.\n\u201d The article gives the formula \u2013 5 pounds of arsenite [ an arsenic-based compound ] to 100 gallons of water .\nEckart , the article said , was ordering as much sled-spraying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-spraying to touch up the spots that may have been missed by the sleds.\n\u201d According to an unnamed authority , \u201c by observing the proper rules and ordinary intelligence , spraying can save a plantation in labor from $ 15 to $ 30 per year per acre.\n\u201d This process appears to have gotten under way not long after Eckart \u2019 s arrival in 1913 .\nGiven the two-year growing season , followed by harvesting , hauling , and milling at a nearby factory , the first crop that got the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at East Coast early in 1916 .\nI \u2019 m always interested in the first time something is tried , because , almost by definition , no one knows what the hell he or she is doing .\nThat \u2019 s why they call it an experiment .\nIt \u2019 s one thing to try arsenic out at the experiment station , another to spray thousands of gallons on thousands of acres will yield thousands of tons of sugar to be consumed thousands of miles away , with no sense of caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Coast refineries -- that things might be a little different this year .\nToo much arsenic ?\nIf so , where ?\nIn the soil ?\nIn the leaves ?\nIn the stalk ?\nIn the sugar ?\nHow about variables like rain , volcanic soil , gradient , uptake characteristics of the cane and the arsenic compound ?\nAnd how about the machinery developed just for the job , which while triumphs of invention for their day might not pass muster in 2016 .\nWhat about the consequences of mingling \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential for human error , with little to no oversight from anyone but those who stood to profit ?\nSeriously , what about it ?\nNext week we \u2019 ll examine those questions in depth .\nSpraying arsenic around food doesn \u2019 t seem like a very good idea to me , but if you read the scientific literature of the time , you start to think it 's like sprinkling a little parmesan on your spaghetti .\nI was about ready to try a spoonful myself ( you could do that too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fowler \u2019 s Solution ! )\n.\nSo I reached out on AOA to find someone familiar with toxicology to give me a more modern understanding .\nA reader with an advanced degree in environmental toxicology got in touch and proved to be terrific .\nI gave her all the information I had about the use of arsenic on the plantation and she gave me her feedback over several exchanges .\nShe displayed the straightforward and careful approach that I associate with good science , and I \u2019 m going to share what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some for later when it \u2019 s more appropriate .\nMy interest was whether enough arsenic could have made it from Olaa \u2019 s cane fields through the harvesting and milling and refining processes to become a potential factor in the 1916 epidemic .\nI sensed she would tell me if this seemed like a crazy idea , so I waited with more than usual interest for her e-mail to pop up in my inbox .\nIt read : Hi Dan \u2013 I would not discount the presence of arsenic ( used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are some thoughts on what you sent me : -- Just as background , arsenic is sometimes a metal and at other times a metalloid .\nThis property makes it very versatile in the forms it can take \u2013 arsenic can form a number of different compounds .\n-- Arsenic is an immune suppressant as are heavy metals in general .\nArsenic binds to sulfur compounds and impairs enzymes ; it also competes with phosphate , which is needed to synthesize ATP to produce energy .\n-- Arsenic does act quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large dose from a \u201c regular \u201d serving of whatever sugary food was eaten , so arsenic could act relatively quickly to suppress a child 's immune system .\n-- Regarding the formulation of the arsenic spray in Hawaii : What they were doing with the caustic soda ( NaOH ) and heat is making white arsenic more water-soluble , so that it would remain in solution \u2013 i.e .\nspray easily and not settle out .\nThat would increase its utility as a pesticide by improving its \u201c flow \u201d and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have any idea what spraying equipment looked like in 1916 but even today it \u2019 s difficult to hit only the weeds and not the crop with pesticide spray .\n( I shudder to think of the occupational exposure . )\nMoreover since the arsenic pesticide was highly water soluble it would have been carried into the soil and been available for uptake by the roots of any plant that was nearby .\nSo yes the sugar cane could have been contaminated by inorganic arsenic .\nI need to do a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand this better .\nIt \u2019 s kind of the opposite of using plants to clean a Super Fund site : in that case the plants are destroyed after binding heavy metals in the soil , while here the plants were refined into food .\nHow helpful was that !\nI replied : Thanks so much .\n-- Here 's a link to a discussion of the spraying technology at olaa .\n-- Here is a discussion of the effect of arsenic on the soil in Hawaii -- I 've found various and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up arsenic .\nThere was a study around 1933 in Hawaii that said a field on which arsenic was used had no more arsenic in the plant than a field that was arsenic-free .\nBut I 've also read about how rice -- which has a major arsenic-uptake problem -- and sugarcane are two of the major plants that take up silicon in large amounts .\nIn the case of rice , the silicon transporters mistake arsenic for silicon and take it up .\nI have no idea if that could happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suggests quite a bit of arsenic was taken up in sugarcane in Brazil \u201d Hi Dan \u2013 I have done a little more reading on arsenic and here are further thoughts ( four journal articles attached ) .\n\u2022 The form in which arsenic was sprayed onto weeds is highly bioavailable to plants , which is why it kills weeds so fast ( in 1-2 days ) .\nIt \u2019 s also highly bioavailable to humans .\nI would have to believe that at least a small amount of arsenite sprayed onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proximate sugar cane .\nIn addition , the \u201c splashing \u201d effect of rain would have carried some arsenite from surface soil onto surrounding plants including the nearby sugar cane .\nThat arsenite could have been taken up by the cane .\n\u2022 The paper from the USDA assumes that the arsenite was washed out of the soil , and that may very well be correct given the hilly terrain and porosity of the soil .\nBut that takes a little bit of time , so the arsenite is available to the cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a week ?\na month ?\nthree months ?\nI don \u2019 t know ) .\nAlso the plants down the hill would be exposed to arsenic migrating from uphill so there \u2019 s a \u201c gradient \u201d effect .\n\u2022 The killed weeds were left in place to decay , which would have caused the arsenic in their tissues to be recirculated back into the soil .\nThat becomes a \u201c secondary \u201d source of arsenic exposure , which would have been available to the sugar cane roots .\nThis variable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fate of arsenic in Hawaii soil : it assumed the only source of arsenic was the original spray .\n\u2022 The Brazilian researchers found that sugarcane does take up arsenic into its tissues and that more is found in the cane than in the leaves .\nSo it is entirely reasonable to assume that arsenic was assimilated by the sugar cane and made it into the raw sugar .\nRegarding the growing season : Hawaii is largely a year-round growing season , right ?\nSo the arsenic weed-killer would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nCane is fast-growing so it would take up water and minerals in the soil at a rapid rate .\nThe cane was taking up arsenic , but it also seemed to be growing normally ( no mention of it being stunted or having small leaves , etc . )\nso the amount present wasn \u2019 t enough to interfere with growth .\nHowever the refining process would concentrate that type of small contaminant .\nWell , this is quite educational , wouldn \u2019 t you agree ?\nI had read before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there could be hell to pay because the refining process would concentrate it .\nI must say that I still didn \u2019 t quite get that \u2013 I imagined a centrifuge spinning all the flotsam and jetsam to the side and leaving pure sugar crystals at the center , ready to fall neatly into one pound bags , pure as the driven snow .\nAfter all it had `` refined '' !\nSo I asked : \u201c One more -- why would refining concentrate the impurity rather than remove it ?\nI was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar itself ... \u201d Her answer : The arsenic that was spread throughout multiple plants has now been concentrated into a small amount of sugar .\nVery roughly , it takes 80 tons of cane to extract one ton of sugar .\nSo the arsenic in 80 tons of cane was released with the sugars .\nMore of the impurities remained in the syrup than the crystals , but there would have been some in the crystals too .\nTo quote Leader of the Pack \u2013 yes , we see .\nI had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar as a food \u2013 unlike a strawberry , which you \u201c process \u201d by planting , growing , and harvesting , sugarcane went through an amazing manufacturing process where it was refined .\nYou could wash off a strawberry before you ate it , but you were pretty much stuck with whatever was in that bag of sugar .\nThis was insidious , for sure , if it \u2019 s true .\nNobody would blame the sugar .\nThey would \u201d blame \u201d ice cream and candy and baked goods and soda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\nThey would blame summer fruit ( much of which was treated with lead arsenate pesticide , a topic to which we will return . )\nThey would observe that cases clustered around provision shops that served and sold those foods began to look like important .\nThey did blame those things , they did observe those things .\nBut nobody listened .\nIce cream causes polio ?\nPlease !\nIt wasn \u2019 t the ice cream , per se , in this theory ; the ice cream was just a vector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar in the ice cream , and that was still only half the equation .\nThe virus itself was the other half .\nSimple math would then explain why in a group of four children sitting on a park bench , one might develop poliomyelitis while the other three did not .\nOne had the virus and one did n't ; one had the arsenic exposure and one did n't ; one had neither ; one had both .\nThe one who had both was the one at risk .\nMy toxiciological correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c light \u2019 exposure ( \u2018 background \u2019 is the wrong word because it implies the arsenic was found naturally in the soil , which it wasn \u2019 t , and \u2018 trace \u2019 and \u2018 light \u2019 aren \u2019 t good words either because they 're not quantitative ) .\nBut a \u2018 light \u2019 exposure to arsenic could affect a human .\nPlus children are smaller than adults and thus more vulnerable to a given dose of toxicant than an adult , just because of body weight.\n\u201d So now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNext question : Exactly where did the sugar go , and what happened when it got there ?\nOh , in case you \u2019 re wondering how much arsenic really got applied at Olaa , here \u2019 s a current map , decades after they stopped .\nThey \u2019 re still trying to get rid of it .\n( Keeau is the modern name for Olaa . )\nAuthor 's personal copy Bioaccessible arsenic in soils of former sugar cane plantations , Island of

Niemeyer f , 1 , John Peard g , Chittaranjan Ray d Things were finally looking up for the Olaa Plantation .\nEckart was reaping the rewards of his bold experiment to kill the plantation \u2019 s runaway weeds with arsenic rather than expensive human labor .\nThe newspapers were full of plaudits .\n\u201c Olaa shows remarkable improvement , \u201d the trade journal Louisana Planter and Sugar Manufacturer reported in September 1915 .\n\u201c The two years administration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the island of Hawaii by Mr. C.F .\nEckart , the former director of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters \u2019 Experiment Station , have been marked by increases in yields and lowering of costs beyond the most sanguine hope of stockholders .\nThe improvements have been general and while particularly noticeable in the data on crops , are , nevertheless , in evidence in the handling of labor and other activities of the company.\n\u201d Although not mentioned , the arsenic treatment must have worked well .\nOn February 9 , 1916 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as saying that \u201c the harvesting of this crop commenced on December 7 , 1914 , and completed on November 25 , 1915 .\nAn unusually early start to the grinding season [ at the mill ] was considered advisable owing to the increased output of sugar expected .\n\u2026 Altogther 283,116 tons were harvested , yielding 32,308.22 tons of sugar.\n\u201d So this 1915 crop , for early 1916 delivery , did so well that they had to start harvesting it early .\nFinally , the gods were cooperating .\nHe told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Honolulu Star-Bulletin was effusive : \u201c Cost of Producing Ton of Olaa Cane Cut Almost 50 Percent.\n\u201d Again , that had to be due in significant measure to the cost savings from the arsenic spraying , although it was n't specifically mentioned .\nOn May 19 , the Hawaiian Gazette reported , \u201c Olaa Sugar Company to Pay First Dividend .\nThis Year \u2019 s Crop [ for 1917 delivery ] Probably Last One To Run Under 30,000 Tons ; Yield Per Acre Grows.\n\u201d Eckart outlined expansive plans to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more railroad equipment , even buy 20 more mules \u2013 a total cost of $ 150,000 .\nOnce more , no mention of arsenic 's role .\n\u201c War prices for sugar , good management , a constructive policy on the part of agents and directors , and a dogged determination to win have brought this great property through to this successful issue , \u201d the paper said .\nEckart was the toast of the planter \u2019 s world .\nBut not for long .\nIn October 1916 -- just five months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Olaa crop [ for 1917 delivery ] was a disappointment .\n\u201c Olaa Plantation , whose varying fortunes have been often the subject of comment by sugar statisticians and publicists , has further reduced its 1916 crop estimates [ for 1917 delivery ] \u2026 The new estimate is now 21,500 tons \u2026 The disappointment of the investors and of the stock market players is keen over Olaa \u2019 s showing this year.\n\u201d You can see the figure below , fifth from the end .\nIn 2003 the Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high levels of arsenic in the soil at two community gardens in Keaau [ Olaa ] on the Big Island , and are offering free medical tests to residents to see if they have absorbed the potentially toxic element . ''\nThe article said `` the probable source was herbicides sprayed on the local sugar plantation from 1915 to 1950 . ''\nSo the use of arsenic at Olaa apparently continued , though how the bagasse paper fit with that is unclear .\nAnd with American participation in World War I in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe American-Hawaiian Steamship freighters stopped their runs to the East Coast and were leased , profitably , to the Navy to carry troops and cargo .\nThe few freighters that remained delivered the raw sugar from Hawaii to San Francisco for overland transport by train ; eventually more Hawaiian sugar stayed on the West Coast instead of the inconvenient East .\nIf you accept the idea that arsenic in Olaa sugarcane led to a poliomyelitis outbreak , the one-year epidemic spike of 1916 begins to make more sense : a toxin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that delivered it to a place ( Brooklyn ) where a virus ( polio ) was circulating , triggering an outbreak of paralysis and death ( poliomyelitis ) .\nThe effect , in scientific terms , was amplification -- the toxin made the virus far more dangerous than either would have been alone .\nIn lay terms , you could call it an Explosion .\nThe Star-Bulletin interviewed a 94-year-old who sprayed arsenic on those Hawaiian fields in the 1920s and '30s .\n`` As a young man , Henry Texeira 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skin broke out in blisters when he sprayed an arsenic-based herbicide in sugar cane fields south of Hilo .\n...\nThe chemical he used was Penite , a brand name for sodium arsenite .\n'People used to suffer like hell with Penite , ' Texeira said .\nIt 's a form of sodium arsenite , an inorganic arsenic compound also known as arseneous acid , sodium salt and sodium meta-arsenite .\n`` Another brand name for the stuff , '' Texeira recalled , `` was Kill-All . ''\n-- *Sources and notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1916 comes from multiple sources including articles on newspapers.com and in specialized sugar journals .\nCase histories of Lettie Caruso , Mrs. Franklin and others are from the New York City Health Department archives of the 1916 epidemic at the American Philosophical Association library in Philadelphia .\nAll names have been changed , which the library required as a condition for access .\nWhile I hesitate as a general rule to do that , it really made no difference in this instance .\nThe chart showing the spike in the polio rate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we prepare to follow the Hawaiian sugar harvest to the U.S. mainland in early 1916 , a natural pause suggests itself .\nI \u2019 ve now presented the basic hypothesis : that arsenic applied for the first time ever to sugarcane fields anywhere , at the Olaa plantation on the Big Island of Hawaii , led to the first massive poliomyelitis epidemic in the United States .\nIt triggered the Explosion that ushered in the Age of Polio .\nThat kind of claim attracts critics who use words like `` laughable . ''\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true . )\nOver at Orac , Denice Walter commented : `` Although I am often highly entertained by your speculation , I would be much more pleased with you if you took a few life science related courses at your local university . ''\nI responded : `` Denice , I remain pleased that you are highly entertained .\nI fear that exposure to actual experts might reduce my ability to amuse you , so I \u2019 ll avoid it for now . ''\n( The claim here is that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business tackling a topic like this .\nI disagree . )\nSo perhaps it \u2019 s time to say a little more about how the theory evolved and where I am heading with it .\nIn 2011 , Mark Blaxill and I wrote a series called The Age of Polio : How an Old Virus and New Toxins Triggered a Man-Made Epidemic .\nIn it , we proposed that the invention of lead arsenate pesticide in 1892 , interacting with poliovirus infections , kicked off the modern era of polio epidemics .\nLead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moth invasion around Boston that threatened to wreck the entire domestic apple crop .\nIn a literal and metaphoric instance of the \u201c butterfly effect \u201d \u2013 seemingly minor and distant events leading to major disruptions -- a few moths escaped their enclosure in a back yard in suburban Medford , and before long turned into teeming masses undulating like black waves across suburban streets to devour fruit trees in one collective gulp .\nThis story almost defies belief , but The Great Gypsy Moth War by Robert J .\nSpear brings it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moth problem , but the association of the pesticide with poliomyelitis is hard for dispassionate observers ( meaning those not wedded to virology as the explanation for everything ) to dismiss .\nIn 1893 , the year after the first use of lead arsenate in Boston , two local doctors wrote a medical journal article , \u201c Is Acute Poliomyelitis Unusually Prevalent This Season ?\n\u201d and very quickly established that it was unusually prevalent .\n\u201c It would not have seemed worthwhile to report these observations had it not been that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts General Hospital in September and October of this year [ apple harvest time ] is decidedly larger than usual .\n\u2026 \u201d Putting together all the cases from four sources , they came up with six polio cases for the period August-November 1892 , and 26 for the same period in 1893 .\nWhile that was an impressive rise , it could have simply been natural variation ; sporadic cases were observed by medical professionals over the past several decades .\nHence the question mark .\nBut the very next year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Vermont , came the answer \u2013 an unmistakable poliomyelitis epidemic .\nThe account , a classic of medical literature worth reading in its own right , was provided by Dr. Charles Caverly , a Rutland physician who also happened to be the president of the state medical society \u2013 and was in the right place at the right time .\nThe beginning is memorable and haunting , given what was to come and the fact that epidemic poliomyelitis was so unfamiliar in the United States that Caverly didn \u2019 t even call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until later articles .\n\u201c During the month of June , 1894 , there appeared in a portion of the valley of the Otter Creek , in the state of Vermont , an epidemic of nervous disease , in which the distinctive and most common symptom was paralysis .\nThe great majority of sufferers were children under six years of age.\n\u201d Hardest hit were the towns of Rutland and Proctor .\nThere were 132 cases and 18 deaths .\nThis was not like Boston the year before .\nThis was big .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger , \u201c lead arsenate was proposed as a cause of polio epidemics early on , \u201d as we wrote in 2011 : '' In Massachusetts , where the compound was first used , the State Forester reported in 1912 , under a section headed Infantile Paralysis : \u201c In view of the fact that a feeling has been entertained by some people in the State that infantile paralysis has been caused in some instances by arsenate of lead used in spraying for the gypsy and brown-tail moths , the State Forester has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to determine if there is any foundation upon which to base such fears.\n\u201d No there was not : \u201c As a result of his research he is firmly convinced that the use of arsenate of lead has in no way been responsible for the existence of the disease [ infantile paralysis ] , and apprehends no danger in the future from its use .\nAny anxiety concerning the danger from the use of arsenate of lead is entirely unwarranted.\n\u201d Of course , today we 'd say that anxiety was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compound !\nOn the other side of the globe , a New Zealand newspaper reported in 1914 : \u201c The oft-expressed opinion that the arsenate of lead spray on fruit is the cause of the prevalence of infantile paralysis will be discussed at the next meeting of the Upper Clutha Fruit-growers \u2019 Association at Bannockburn .\nThe association is taking steps to obtain the result of Government experiments regarding this matter.\n\u201d ( We have not found a follow-up report . )\n\u201d These concerns were never taken seriously .\nWhen you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a million cases of death or disability a year worldwide by the 1940s -- that was worse than unfortunate .\nWhen DDT replaced lead arsenate after World War II , a handful of brave souls put forward the idea that pesticides , not the poliovirus , were the cause .\nAs Mark and I wrote in 2011 : In 1949 Drs .\nMorton S. Biskind and Irving Bieber published \u201c DDT Poisoning \u2013 A New Symptom With Neuropsychiatric Manifestations \u201d in the American Journal of Psychotherapy .\n\u201c By far the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective reactions and the extreme muscular weakness , \u201d they reported .\nIn subsequent papers and testimony , Biskind linked DDT directly to cases of poliomyelitis \u2013 including a Dec. 12 , 1950 , statement to the Select Committee to Investigate the Use of Chemicals in Food Products , United States House of Representatives .\nHe quoted another doctor that \u201c wherever DDT had been used intensively against polio , not only was there an epidemic of the syndrome I have described but the incidence of polio continued to rise and in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c This is not surprising since it is known that not only can DDT poisoning produce a condition that may easily be mistaken for polio in an epidemic but also being a nerve poison itself , may damage cells in the spinal cord and thus increase the susceptibility to the virus.\n\u201d \u201c Facts are stubborn , \u201d Biskind concluded , \u201c and refusal to accept them does not avoid their inexorable effects -- the tragic consequences are now upon us.\n\u201d The theory was also advanced by Ralph R. Scobey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same House committee .\nTitled \u201c The Poison Cause of Poliomyelitis and Obstructions To Its Investigation , \u201d it described associations between harvest seasons , fresh fruit consumption , and polio epidemics .\nThe next year , Biskind made the link even more explicit : \u201c In the United States the incidence of polio had been increasing prior to 1945 at a fairly constant rate , but its epidemiologic characteristics remained unchanged .\nBeginning in 1946 the rate of increase more than doubled.\n\u201d Yet far from looking into a toxic etiology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire apparatus of communication , lay and scientific alike , has been devoted to denying , concealing , suppressing , distorting and attempts to convert into its opposite , the overwhelming evidence .\nLibel , slander and economic boycott have not been overlooked in this campaign.\n\u201d More recently , medical writer Jim West has argued strongly for the link , and pointed to other risks from pesticides , like Parkinson \u2019 s Disease .\nIn articles like , \u201c Everything You Think You Know About Polio is Wrong , \u201d he champions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Today , few remember this poignant writer who struggled with the issues of pesticides , issues that Rachel Carson would be allowed to politely bring to public awareness nine years later , as the lead story in The New Yorker magazine and then as a national best seller , by limiting her focus to the environment and wildlife .\nBiskind had the audacity to write about human damage.\n\u201d Under our theory , that 's true , but it 's half the equation ; the poliovirus is required as well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the implications reach far beyond polio : Toxins can amplify minor microbes into major epidemics to a far greater extent than is currently recognized .\nWith this paradigm in mind , let \u2019 s head back across the Pacific to Brooklyn .\nEarly in 1916 , sugar from Hawaii arrived at the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company dock in Brooklyn , which had recently been overhauled into a two-story behemoth .\nYou may recognize the map below from earlier in the series .\nIt shows the way in which poliomyelitis cases arrayed themselves in 1916 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-sided rectangle to the left center is the American-Hawaiian dock .\nWe \u2019 ll pick it up from there next week .\nThe bulk of the raw sugar headed for the East Coast from Hawaii \u2019 s Olaa Plantation left the port of Hilo in February and arrived a few weeks later in New York Harbor .\nThe freighters docked at the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company pier at the Bush Terminal in Brooklyn ; as I outlined last week , this is right where many of the early cases of polio clustered .\n( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 30 ; the dock is at the middle left . )\nYou can see the dock close up below ; it \u2019 s at the bottom , Pier 7 , the one that looks like a tuning fork .\nYou 'd have to rotate the image about 120 degrees to the left to align with the map above -- the Bush Terminal piers jut northeast from Brooklyn into New York 's Upper Bay .\nFrom there the sugar was distributed mainly to the National Sugar Refinery in Long Island City , Queens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world -- just across Newtown Creek from Brooklyn , and to a lesser extent to another National Refinery on the waterfront in Yonkers .\nToday the Newtown Creek site is a park awaiting development ; the Yonkers plant is still there .\nA significant amount of Hawaiian raw sugar was delivered separately to Philadelphia , and a smaller portion of it went to Boston .\nSome stayed on the West Coast at a Hawaiian-owned refinery in Crockett , California .\nAt the plants , the raw sugar was refined into the finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , anyway \u2013 that in the ordinary course of events any toxins would be refined away , the refined sugar would be tested for any and all impurities , and once ratified would be on its merry way without any record left behind .\nSugar from all over the Western Hemisphere poured through these refineries every day , after all .\nNew York was the sugar refining capital of the world .\nHawaiian sugar was just a small fraction of it , and Olaa 's was about five percent of that .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only Hawaiian sugar , gave the refiners fits in 1916 .\nThe grains were uneven and too small ; \u201c scale \u201d \u2013 residue \u2013 on the coils in the vacuum pans had to be boiled out with corroded lead every two weeks ; the cotton bags themselves tore easily and could n't be reused .\n( You can imagine some Hawaiian plantation owner slamming his desk and saying , Dammit , can \u2019 t we even get the bags right ? )\nAnd that was the small stuff .\nThe big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar that they couldn \u2019 t get out .\nWe know this because things got so bad for Hawaiian sugar \u2019 s reputation with the refineries that the next year , the sugar producers sent a representative , R.S .\nNorris , to New York and Philadelphia .\n( He was dispatched by H.P .\nAgee , director of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association .\nAgee , as it happens , was the first to suggest arsenic as a pesticide for weeds in sugarcane fields .\nAgee had succeeded C.F .\nEckart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect of the arsenic treatment .\nSmall world . )\nNorris produced a remarkable report , which was picked up and reprinted as a three-part series ( perhaps with more than a trace amount of competitive glee ) by the Louisiana Planter and Sugar Manufacturer weekly in February 1918 .\nTwo of those problems were pretty striking \u2013 first , there was \u201c cloudiness and sediment \u201d in the barrel syrups , liquid created during the refining process that was sold on its own under names like Golden Syrup .\nSecond , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in the syrup \u2013 it was in the grain .\nAt the Yonkers plant , You can dig a lot deeper into these primary documents \u2013 and please do , your thoughts are invited -- but for our purposes right now the point is this : Something in the grain \u201c caused the trouble.\n\u201d We 're no longer talking the weeds or the stalk or the soil or the bagasse .\nThis is the part people consume .\nI asked the environmental toxicologist who is advising me what she thought : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manufacturer indicates the Hawaiian sugar continued to give off residue even after repeat washing and flocculation with phosphate , \u201d she told me .\n\u201c They refer to \u2018 dull gray \u2019 sugar , which I assume indicates that the final product still wasn \u2019 t completely purified .\nThere is a discussion at the end of p. 44 about the Hawaiian sugars being \u2018 polarizing \u2019 due to proportions of glucose and sucrose , which would have enhanced the retention of a highly water-soluble substance such as inorganic arsenic.\n\u201d It got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI wonder how consumers would have felt if they knew their kid 's ice cream cone for winning the Little League game was made with syrup with so much unknown `` sediment '' that the vendor got 25 percent off .\nIn Philadelphia it was even worse -- Hawaiian barrel syrup sold for 9 to 10 cents a gallon , Cuban for 15 to 17 cents .\nAccording to my toxicologist : \u201c I read through the brochure on sugar refining that you attached .\nI see that the sugar syrup is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove impurities .\nThis is an issue similar to removing arsenic from groundwater , which is not easy .\nIn the arsenite form , arsenic would tend to run through the carbon filter rather than adsorbing onto the carbon surfaces .\nOn the other hand if the plant has transformed arsenite to arsenate ( i.e .\nadded more oxygens ) then the carbon filter could probably remove it from the syrup.\n\u201d She included several scientific papers for reference .\n\u201c The Brazilian paper and the German paper both state that the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d she continued .\n\u201c Thus it \u2019 s reasonable to assume that if there was arsenite in the original plants , a good proportion of it would survive the refining process and be incorporated into the crystallized sugar.\n\u201d There is no mention of arsenic in the follow-up report ; one wonders if the possibility had occurred to Agee and Eckart , the two men who pioneered it .\nI figured the arsenic , if there was any , would be spun off into barrel or golden syrup , molasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote : \u201c Scroll down this link until you see the green crystallized sugar .\nCrystallized sugar can certainly contain other substances .\nThe goal of the refining process wasn \u2019 t to remove everything except the sugar molecule ; rather the purpose was to extract sugar out of the whole plant .\nRemember the mention of the \u2018 grey \u2019 final product ?\nThe sugar , let alone the syrups and molasses , would have still contained impurities at the end of the refining process .\n\u2026 More of the impurities remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there would have been some in the crystals too.\n\u201d ( Norris looked into the sediment 's impurities , taking a sample from the West Coast refinery .\nHere , from the planters ' journal , is what he says : `` On account of the ease with which the sediment goes into solution and the high density and viscosity of the syrup , we have found it difficult to separate out , and for that reason have not had sufficient time to isolate the substance in a pure form .\nAnalysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syrup from which the sediment had been removed and of the crude separated residue showed the main constituents to be as follows '' -- then he listed potash , soda , lime , magnesia , sulfuric anhydride and chlorin .\nAfter further purification they still ended up with combinations of some of those in the sediment .\n`` The purest product still contains considerable organic matter , so the sediment may be an organic compound .\nUnder the microscope the sediment is seen to be made up of very small , needle-shaped crystals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it interesting that they did n't have `` sufficient time to isolate the substance in a pure form . ''\nReally ?\nAnd also that the sediment `` may be an organic compound . ''\nAll of this only matters if arsenic made it through the diluting , spraying , weeding , harvesting , milling , and refining and into the final product .\nThe question is how you tell .\nIf there \u2019 s anyone who ate spoonfuls of it in 1916 straight out of the bag and got paralyzed , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barring that , the fact that so many people that year suspected foods that contained a lot of sugar is the most powerful association .\nHere 's a sugar manufacturer describing all the uses to which refined sugar is put : \u201c Sugar for tea and coffee ; sugar for fruits and cereals ; sugar for icings , ice-cream and preserving ; sugar for candy and chewing gum ; sugar for chocolate and condensed milk manufacturers ; sugar for cracker and biscuit makers ; sugar adapted to an infinite variety of uses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let \u2019 s recall the \u201c provision \u201d stores on which suspicion had fallen for the first time that summer of 1916 , according to the city \u2019 s health commissioner : \u201c There seems to be a well-marked tendency for cases in Manhattan to appear in the immediate vicinity of stables , groceries , meat or poultry markets , lunch rooms , delicatessen shops and bakeries or macaroni factories .\n\u2026 It is surprising with what regularity one or the other is found in the building next door to a house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also examined the same districts with an unbiased mind , seem always to believe that cases range themselves with a definite relation to shops of this type .\nIt has been repeatedly pointed out in earlier epidemics that stables are often associated with cases of poliomyelitis .\nThis has been undoubtedly true in New York during the present summer , but the other association with provision shops has also forced itself upon our attention.\n\u201d It \u2019 s worth deconstructing this crucial paragraph once more .\nHaven Emerson , the commissioner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slowing the epidemic , considered the \u201c ice cream and candy \u201d idea to be nonsense \u2013 as have all the other experts for the past 100 years -- and he submerges it in that paragraph beneath generic \u201c food , \u201d \u201c provisions , '' and a nearly impenetrable prose style .\nBut as you may recall , Emerson \u2019 s report includes a chart linking `` provision '' stores with clusters of poliomyelitis .\nAnd now , with more specificity , another pattern emerges : Candy .\nGrocery .\nBakery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBakery .\nIce cream .\nCandy .\nGrocery .\nDelicatessen .\nGrocery .\nLunch Room .\nGrocery.\n\u201d That comes just a few pages after Emerson \u2019 s dismissive reference to those who wrote letters to the health departments .\n\u201c Two hundred and thirty suggestions as the cause of the disease were received , the largest number of authors ( 80 ) attributing the existing calamity to foods .\nIce cream , soft drinks , candy and summer fruits were generally accused , cereals and canned foods coming second in favor.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ did have the respect of the health department , and letter writers who did n't , saw the same thing : Foods that contained a lot of sugar \u2013 the sugar link was unmentioned and perhaps unrecognized \u2013 were the chief suspects .\nHow far are we , really , from the companies ' own list of \u201c sugar for fruits and cereals ; sugar for icings , ice-cream and preserving [ canned foods ] ; sugar for candy and chewing gum ; sugar for chocolate and condensed milk manufacturers ; sugar for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an infinite variety of uses , specially made and speedily delivered ?\n\u201d I \u2019 ll go out on a limb and say , not far .\nHere are two ads of the era .\nDomino was another huge Brooklyn sugar refinery ; it is not one we \u2019 re discussing here , but the uses of \u201c barrel syrup \u201d ( golden syrup ) are neatly described .\nSo we 've got golden syrup with sediment in it , and grains of sugar with something in them , showing up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fritters and ice cream , waffles , griddle cakes and fried mush , and in cookies , cakes , muffins , puddings , sauces and baked beans .\nAnd much else .\nHere \u2019 s an ad from a condensed milk manufacturer .\nDespite its wholesome name , anyone who has ever scooped a spoonful knows it 's half sugar .\nHere it is rather unashamedly marketed toward mothers of infants ( that \u2019 s a condensed milk can with a spoon for each child ) : Before we finish , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs I said , I do n't know exactly where all the Olaa sugar went .\nSome may have gone to the refinery in California , where there was no poliomyelitis epidemic , which does nothing to advance the theory .\nFurthermore , there 's no direct evidence of arsenic in refined sugar anywhere at all in 1916 .\nJust because arsenic was used to kill weeds on a Hawaiian sugarcane plantation for the first time in 1916 , and there were issues with the quality of Hawaiian sugar in 1916 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the epidemic just before the outbreak , does n't mean the outbreak had anything to do with arsenic .\nIt might have been arsenic in sugar , but not from Hawaiian pesticide treatment .\nIn 1900 , there was an outbreak of arsenic poisoning in beer tainted by sugar that had been manufactured with sulphuric acid containing arsenic .\nAuthorities first thought the subsequent illnesses came from drinking too much -- another case of blaming the victim .\nIt might have been sugar -- but as a vehicle for the virus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds sugar hospitable -- the sugar cubes used to deliver the live-virus vaccine must mean it does .\nThe whole epidemic could be illustrative of nothing more than the wisdom of the ubiquitous restroom sign , `` Employees must wash hands before returning to work . ''\nOr maybe it 's just the sugar , nothing to do with either the virus or the toxin .\nWe 've been discussing that in the comments , whether sugar consumption itself makes one more vulnerable to paralytic illness .\nThat is the strong form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDavid Burd sent me this interesting article from 1991 connecting the ebbs and flows of the sugar growing and refining business -- including sugar beets , a whole vast area that I have n't touched on -- with poliomyelitis epidemics .\nMy problem with this is it works almost too well , explaining everything that ever happened in terms of sugar .\nIt 's easy to put yourself in a box if you make too many claims for one source of causation , and blind yourself when it manifests in new ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this series , and to one basic hypothesis I 've put to as many tests as possible .\nAnd despite the caveats and the unorthodox novelty of the idea , I find the evidence intriguing -- a toxic metal was first used on sugar shipped to New York Harbor right before the first big poliomyelitis epidemic broke out there .\nFamilies living near the dock where it was delivered suffered the first cases .\nThere was widespread suspicion that summer of a variety of foods whose only apparent commonality was that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's biologically plausible -- both the virus and arsenic end up in the gut where `` amplification '' could turn a common and harmless enterovirus into a deadly and damaging epidemic .\nIt explains the anomalies of a paradigm -- the hygiene hypothesis -- that does n't really fit the facts .\nThat brings us full circle , with Mrs. Franklin collapsing paralyzed in June in her ice cream store in the tenement on Gates Avenue in Brooklyn , a place where two infants , one living in the apartment adjacent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's what I think : The Age of Polio , and of subsequent modern epidemics like autism , had just exploded into view .\nSadly , there was so much more to come .\nWhen Mrs. G.H .\nFranklin woke up after collapsing on the floor of her Brooklyn ice cream parlor on June 19 , 1916 , she found herself in a ward at St. Mary \u2019 s Hospital , paralyzed .\nShe was 56 years old .\nJust two days earlier , the Brooklyn Daily Eagle ran a story on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Infant Paralysis in the Boro ; Health Board Acts.\n\u201d Despite the timing , doctors were loathe to describe Mrs. Franklin 's case as polio .\nFor one thing she simply seemed too old for infantile paralysis -- the oldest person in the health department case files that summer .\n\u201c The hospital records show that the case was considered some type of meningitis altho a lumbar puncture showed nothing abnormal , \u201d according to a health department report .\n\u201c On July 8 she was brought to her son \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Queens .\nOn July 30 , after she left , her grandsons Herbert and Calvin were taken acutely ill , the former promptly being diagnosed poliomyelitis , the diagnosis in the latter not yet known .\n\u201c On July 15 , Mrs. Franklin moved to 4559 Metropolis Avenue , Queens , and nine days after arriving there , her grandson Willy was taken ill and also Edith Smith , the daughter of another tenant in the same house .\nBoth proved to have poliomyelitis .\n\u201c An interesting sidelight on this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Mrs. Franklin was first taken ill at 1295 Gates Avenue , an Italian baby on the top floor became suddenly ill and died within 24 hours , no diagnosis being made.\n\u201d Trying to untangle the coincidences from the clues was beyond the health department \u2019 s ken .\nYet the department spent a lot of its time building up voluminous files on each case and tracking down every possible contact .\nThis was a misadventure if the hypothesis I 've laid out in earlier segments is true , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of arsenic in sugar that had recently arrived at the refineries from Hawaii .\nThe environmental toxicologist who \u2019 s

.\nInteracting in people , mostly children , with active polio infections , a `` light '' arsenic exposure turned a benign summer bug into a poliomyelitis epidemic .\nWe see the evidence in the way the early cases clustered around the Brooklyn port where the sugar arrived ; we see it in Queens and Yonkers , with the two sugar refineries and the highest proportion of cases .\nWe see it in the @ @

''\nThe circumstances , the collateral facts , and the evidence do seem to connect and confirm each other .\nAs I \u2019 ve shown , the \u201c experts \u201d lampooned and failed to follow up on repeated observations that sugar-heavy foods , from candy to baked goods to soft drinks to the places that sold and served them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delis and lunchrooms , seemed to be the centers of polio outbreaks .\nThat dismissive approach by the `` experts '' to eyewitnesses and `` ordinary '' people is an ongoing tragedy and an overriding theme of this project .\nJust because they failed to take it seriously a century ago does not mean we ca n't take it seriously now .\nThat 's what historical epidemiology is all about .\nLet \u2019 s end our survey of the New York epidemic where we started , with the widely lampooned idea that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed classic of false correlation , even though people cited it repeatedly at the time .\nThat brings us back to Mrs. G.W .\nFranklin and her ice cream store at 1295 Gates Avenue in Brooklyn , the one \u201c all the children naturally frequently , \u201d in a building where two cousins died in May 1916 .\nIt \u2019 s the place where Mrs. Franklin collapsed on the floor on June 19 , paralyzed .\nIt was a strange scenario that matched the observations people were making about places like that being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public health commissioner at the time , Haven Emerson , said : \u201c It may not add to the sum of scientific data to quote the suggestions received by the Department of Health as to the cause and means of curing or preventing poliomyelitis ; but as a record of human interest the letters sent from all over this country and from many foreign lands present a picture which it is well for health officers to bear in mind .\nOne hardly knows whether to laugh at the fantasies or weep over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Two hundred and thirty suggestions as the cause of the disease were received , '' he continued , `` the largest number of authors ( 80 ) attributing the existing calamity to foods .\nIce cream , soft drinks , candy and summer fruits were generally accused , cereals and canned foods coming second in favor .

''\nGerm theory was in ascendancy and environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which did not exist , either .\nTwo factors as the root of polio epidemics would have seemed fiendishly implausible .\nWas n't one more than enough to try to wrap your mind around ?\nIf the arsenic co-factor theory is true , and I certainly believe it is , we ought to be able to apply it to other polio epidemics , whatever the delivery and exposure mechanism .\nThat would be a reasonable and fundamental test .\nBut how do we logically proceed ?\nI can think of four ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arsenic in other polio epidemics .\nWe could look for other toxins beside arsenic that could have been co-factors separately or in combination .\nWe could look at sugar and see whether , in subsequent years and places , it emerges once again .\nOr we could look for signs of an association with food more broadly .\nIn fact , I 'm going to do all that .\nBut for starters , let \u2019 s pick food , which is the big clue from the New York epidemic .\nThis week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of an outbreak in 1926 while doing other research this at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda , Maryland .\nIt just popped up , as facts tend to do around a good hypothesis .\nThe article , no more than a page long , concerned a 1926 outbreak in the Broadstairs area of Kent , England .\nThe article ran in the January 15 , 1927 , edition of the British Medical Journal .\nThe epidemic began in October and primarily affected children at certain schools in the area .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak were four facts : \u2022 \u201c The disease was limited mainly to the children attending private schools in the district , particularly boarding schools \u2026 the private schools had very little communication with each other.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c The disease started almost simultaneously in all the schools affected , and ceased almost entirely at the end of a fortnight.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c The disease did not spread to the adjoining districts.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c The disease did not spread in the elementary schools.\n\u201d Out of 67 cases , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not connected with the schools or institutions , except indirectly \u2013 for example , one whose brother attended a school where a case occurred.\n\u201d ( That was the only such example given , alas .\nHaving a brother who attended the school seems barely `` indirect . ''\n) One mistress and two members of domestic staffs at the private schools were also affected .\nIn one convalescent home there were two children and three staff members affected .\n\u201c Then , \u201d the report continues , \u201c there was the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed in a hotel in Broadstairs during the season , who left the town on October 6 , developed the disease on the 16th , and died in a London hospital on October 21 ; and that of a young woman , age 29 , who stayed in Broadstairs from October 2 to October 9 , and died on the 22nd.\n\u201d The authors also cite the case \u201c of the brother-in-law of the headmaster of one of the schools , who had been staying in Broadstairs for three weeks .\nHe visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch there .\nHe left Broadstairs the following day and was taken ill with the complaint on October 16th ( the boys were taken ill in the school on October 13th ) .\n\u201d Given this , the virus-alone theory of polio has some heavy lifting to do in Broadstairs .\nIt needs to explain how all these schools , with not much interaction between them , developed simultaneous polio epidemics ; and why the disease was pretty much confined to those places , and institutions like the convalescent homes , but skipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large .\nAnd why it lasted the same two weeks in all those locations .\nI wish I knew more about the British education system \u2013 I \u2019 m always getting public and private and elementary and secondary mixed up -- but in my head I imagine a fairly evolved system of food delivery to schools and other institutions like convalescent homes , schools , restaurants , hotels ...\nSince the disease broke out around harvest time , let \u2019 s pick apples as a source and let 's blame lead arsenate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used since 1892 in Boston to fight gypsy and coddling moths on apple trees .\n( By 1926 , lead arsenate had already been suggested as a polio trigger more than once , from Boston to Australia . )\nAn orchard or a wholesale food distributor could have delivered apples from the same tainted batch to all these institutions .\nI imagine a vintage vehicle pulling up to the schools driven by a man in a white cap and coat with `` Broadstairs Produce '' on the side of the truck .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meal that came with the job and biting into a bright red apple .\nBut why this year in this place ?\nLet us count the ways : a poorly mixed batch of pesticide ; an overzealous applicator ; a drought that failed to rinse the produce before harvest ; sheer bad luck of some kind with a toxin without much margin for error .\nThen , of course , the poliovirus needed to be circulating .\nOne of the first students affected had recently returned from Brittany , so it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France and spread it widely at the start of school .\nIt 's also possible , of course , that a food handler with the virus spread it that way , offering up both polio and the poison in one serving .\nThe fact that the Broadstairs cases hit \u201c particularly boarding schools \u201d is important , since boarding students would have taken all their meals there , as opposed to the private day school students who would have gone home in the evening .\nAnd the fact the outbreak didn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too .\nDid these younger kids go home for lunch and therefore never eat the same bad apples as their older schoolmates who got sick ?\nThe fact the students lived at the boarding schools created more risk from contagion , I know .\nBut the totality of evidence includes the waiter at the hotel and the headmaster \u2019 s brother-in-law who had lunch at a school .\nWhat \u2019 s the link ?\nFood .\n( Even the woman who was visiting for two weeks was likelier to stay in a hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . )\nThe age tally for the outbreak : \u201c from 1 to 5 years , 7 ; 5 to 10 years , 18 ; 10 to 15 years , 27 ; 15 to 20 years , 5 ; 20 to 25 years , 2 ; 25 to 30 years , 3.\n\u201d This skews older than usual for 1926 , but it fits with the ages of the kids ( and adults ) who ate most of their food in institutional settings .\nThe four deaths in Broadstairs tend to confirm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 , at a private boarding school ; a woman , age 28 , a teacher at a girls boarding school ; a boy , aged 8 , a day scholar at a private day and boarding school ; a boy , aged 5 , who attended the infant department of an elementary school.\n\u201d As I described in earlier articles , adults usually don \u2019 t get poliomyelitis ( remember Mrs. Franklin , 56 , and her ice cream store in Brooklyn ?

''\n\u2022 There can be individual susceptibility to the virus , but it does n't have to be arsenic .\nMaybe it 's the physical effect of the sugar ; or bad diets generally reducing kids \u2019 immunity , or vaccines or lack of breastfeeding , as Cynthia Cornoyer suggested , or some other man-made intervention are responsible .\n\u2022 ( Courtesy of commenter VE who pointed to this alternative I overlooked : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Coxsackie virus and arsenic .\nOr some other virus/bacteria/munchkin and arsenic .\nWhat evidence is there to prove that polio virus was there in NYC 1916 , causing all these paralysis and death cases ?\nDetroit 1958 epidemic had taught us that when tested , there are several viruses to `` blame '' for the illness that is called `` polio '' .\nSo , I 'm really curious : what evidence science can offer to establish it was polio virus in 1916 ?\nThe first idea , that the poliovirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably accepted by 99-percent-plus of experts and lay people .\nIt is well expressed by our commenter Eindeker : \u201c But you build a whole hypothesis on some speculative co-factor whereas the commonly accepted explanation for the polio outbreaks in cities in the early 20th C is bizarrely improved hygiene and sanitation \u2026 There is no need to invoke some speculative co-factor ( arsenic et al ) in changes in polio epidemiology during the 20th Century , unless you classify increasing hygiene and reduced exposure at a young age , as a co-factor.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of Occam \u2019 s razor , one of my own favorite principles \u2013 that the simplest explanation is usually correct .\nIn this instance Eindeker is saying , as I read it , that I 'm in violation of Occam 's rule , because there is \u201c no need \u201d to cook up a co-factor to go with the virus .\nIt 's necessary and sufficient without it .\nExcept it 's not .\nIn my epigraph to the series I invoke Einstein \u2019 s view that \u201c things should be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler.\n\u201d As the AOA reader and environmental toxicologist who 's been helping it out put this theory : `` People exposed to arsenic and the polio virus simultaneously will develop a worse case of polio than if they had not been exposed to the arsenic.\n\u201d She elaborated : `` A co-exposure is a situation in which a person is exposed to two different agents which interact and cause a response that is different than if the person had only been exposed to one of the agents .\nThis seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the rate of microcephaly in Columbian infants exposed to Zika in utero is at this point lower than the rate for Brazilian infants , which implies that there is a second factor involved in the Brazilian cases .\n`` Contemporaneous observers were surprised to see the polio virus turn deadly , because it had previously been thought to be relatively benign .\nWhat you are pointing out is that polio epidemics became deadly right around the same time as the use of heavy metal pesticides on agricultural crops took hold .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known , but your research has dug up the fact that arsenic was used in the sugar cane fields .\nSugar is a somewhat unique crop because it ends up in concentrated form , so impurities can get concentrated too .\nIn NYC in 1916 , arsenic wasn \u2019 t really 'circulating ' ; exposure would have been irregular .\nHowever , the virus may have been circulating .\nThe most obvious mechanism for the arsenic is that , by causing GI problems , it facilitated the virus \u2019 crossing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for an unexposed person to mount an effective immune challenge to any infectious agent .\nIf the virus crossed the intestinal barrier at a faster rate because of pre-existing damage done by arsenic , then the unexposed person \u2019 s immune system might be overwhelmed , and the damage would already be done before the immune system had a chance to get rolling . ''\nIn the same way I believe , based on reporting and research by many people ( including myself ) , that autism is an environmentally triggered illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and live viruses like the MMR and chickenpox .\nThey amplify and potentiate each other .\nThey make it far more likely that an infant vaccinated with a grossly excessive stew of viruses and toxins , especially metals , is primed for a fall .\nEven the exposure path from the gut to the nervous system may be relevant to autism .\nThe second critique of the arsenic-virus theory is the toxin-only critique -- there \u2019 s no such thing as a poliovirus , or if there is it doesn \u2019 t trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c vaccine \u201d didn \u2019 t really end those epidemics .\nUnder this theory , It was banning DDT that caused the epidemics to diminish .\nCases were camouflaged as `` flaccid paralysis . ''\nThe third objection is that there could have been a co-factor , but it did n't have to be arsenic .\nThat is true .\nI went looking for arsenic in association with the 1916 outbreak and think I found a strong connection .\nStill , this entire exercise could be a prime example of confirmation bias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar plantation in Hawaii somehow triggered the great Northeast epidemic of 1916 by using arsenic to kill weeds .\nSay what ?\n( The fourth objection -- it was a virus , but not the poliovirus -- is also worth more scrutiny but is not central to whether my arsenic hypothesis stands or falls . )\nBut it 's also true one needs confidence in one 's theories until and unless they lose their explanatory power , as Karl Popper wrote .\n`` Propose theories which can be criticized .\nThink about possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give up your theories too easily\u2014not , at any rate , before you have critically examined your criticism .

after Krahling and Wlochowski originally launched the suit .\nMerck is more powerful than ever and vaccine mandates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFrom June , 2012 .\nBy Dan Olmsted and Mark Blaxill Merck is the only company licensed in the United States to produce the individual mumps vaccine , as well as the MMRII and a newer shot called the MMRV or ProQuad , which also contains the chickenpox vaccine .\nThat gives Merck an effective monopoly on the product line , which by our estimate has brought the company as much as $ 10 billion in business since 2000 .\nThe complaint conservatively estimates MMRII purchases by the Centers for Disease Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If tests showed the mumps vaccine is ineffective -- or far less so than promised -- the door would be opened to any number of adverse events for Merck , from federal regulators pulling the licenses for all of its mumps-vaccine-containing products , to intensified competition from other manufacturers if they became aware of the problem .\nWhat \u2019 s more , weak efficacy could be triggering real-time , real-world health problems here and abroad , where a version of the MMRII is also used .\nMumps outbreaks unexpectedly occurred in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting the three-year cycle in which younger children become exposed .\nA total of 6,500 cases were reported in a highly vaccinated population in the Midwest in 2006 , according to the suit , and another 5,000 cases in 2009 ; in the years leading up to the first outbreak , the annual average had been 265 cases .\nIf that pattern holds true , another outbreak might be due as early as this summer .\nAdditionally , poor vaccine efficacy has the effect of pushing some cases of mumps to a later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous disease that can induce sterility in males .\nOne intriguing implication is that no vaccine at all might have been better than the one Merck currently produces .\nThe suit claims that as a result of the fraud , the U.S. government has been cheated out of millions of dollars paid by the CDC to buy the vaccine for its immunization program .\nIt says the agency , and other government bodies , were wrongly deprived of the knowledge they needed to make proper use of taxpayer money and sound medical decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago that mumps would be eradicated in the United States by 2010 , an outcome predicated on the idea that the vaccine worked . )\nThe suit describes Merck \u2019 s allegedly no-holds-barred effort to protect its market position .\n\u201c Merck set out to conduct testing of its mumps vaccine that would support its original efficacy finding .\nIn performing this testing , Merck \u2019 s objective was to report efficacy of 95 percent or higher regardless of the vaccine \u2019 s true efficacy .\nThe only way Merck could accomplish this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsifying the test results .\n\u2026 Krahling and Wlochowski participated on the Merck team that conducted this testing and witnessed firsthand the fraud in which Merck engaged to reach its desired results .\nMerck internally referred to the testing as Protocol 007.\n\u201d The suit says testing began in 1999 , led by Senior Investigator David Krah and his second-in-command , Mary Yagodich .\nMerck \u2019 s Executive Director of Vaccine Research , Alan Shaw , approved the testing methodology , the suit says .\nKrahling said he complained about the fraud to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Vaccine Research Division , and brought \u201c actual testing samples and plaque counting sheets to demonstrate to Emini the fraudulent data that Krah was directing .\nEmini agreed that Krah had falsified the data , \u201d the suit said , but defended some aspects of the work .\n\u201c Emini promised to conduct an \u2018 internal audit \u2019 of the mumps testing .\n\u2026 Emini ordered Krahling not to call the FDA .\nImmediately after the meeting [ a Human Resources representative ] approached Krahling and again threatened that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FDA.\n\u201d Shortly thereafter , Krahling was transferred to another lab , and soon left the company ; Wlochowski was also transferred and left the next year .\n( In 2005 , Emini became Executive Vice President of Vaccine Research and Development at Wyeth Pharmaceuticals .\nHe is now Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Vaccine Research at Pfizer . )\nThe suit describes how Merck scientists allegedly engaged in a number of techniques in order to claim that the vaccine remained effective , from essentially testing the vaccine against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the more virulent \u201c wild \u201d type to which children are exposed in the real world -- to adding animal antibodies that increased potency in lab tests ; to , when all else failed , simply changing the data accurately recorded by Krahling , Wlochowski , and other virologists .\nWhile many of the details of the alleged fraud are technical , one internal Merck document clearly describes the nature of the mission , according to the suit .\nIt was titled : \u201c Objective : Identify a mumps neutralization assay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurement of a greater than or equal to 95 % seroconversion rate in MMRII vaccines.\n\u201d Merck responded Friday that the suit is \u201c completely without merit \u201d and said the company will \u201c vigorously defend \u201d itself \u2013 presumably by quickly filing a motion to have the suit dismissed .\nMerck pointedly noted that , to date , the U.S. Department of Justice has not joined the suit .\nUnder the federal whistleblower statute , anyone can bring a whistleblower suit alleging that a business they worked for defrauded the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSuch a suit remains sealed while the company has a chance to review it , and Department of Justice ( DOJ ) attorneys decide whether to join as plaintiffs , throwing the government \u2019 s weight behind the whistleblower \u2019 s claim that it was defrauded .\nIn this case the DOJ did not reach its decision on whether to join as a plaintiff quickly or definitively .\nThe lengthy period between the filing of the suit by Krah and Wlochowski , on April 27 , 2010 , and the department \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time being , on April 27 , 2012 , required the DOJ to request multiple six-month extensions , according to the civil docket for the case , filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania .\nIn its statement declining to intervene , the department asked that if either side wants to settle or dismiss the case , \u201c the court solicit the written consent of the United States before ruling or granting its approval.\n\u201d The mumps component of the combination measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR ) vaccine has long been a source of controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the category introducing a vaccine named MMR in 1971 , using a strain of mumps taken from the throat of a Merck scientist \u2019 s daughter named \u201c Jeryl Lynn.\n\u201d ( In 1979 , Merck replaced the MMR \u2019 s rubella component due to safety concerns and named the reformulated vaccine MMRII ) .\nStarting in 1986 , the first serious competitors to Merck \u2019 s vaccine began to emerge based on a different mumps component : the so-called Urabe strain , which was first licensed by Japan \u2019 s Biken Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in countries all over the world , including Canada , Japan , and the United Kingdom , to name just a few .\nFor many years , however , Merck was able maintained its advantage in the category by outpacing the performance of Urabe-based MMR vaccines .\nMerck \u2019 s main advantage came from its superior safety reputation .\nOne of the most troublesome adverse events for MMR vaccines , aseptic meningitis , is a serious and potentially fatal side effect of vaccination .\nAccording to a major textbook on vaccines , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aseptic meningitis wherever adverse reactions have been studied.\n\u201d By contrast , according to another review cited in the complaint , \u201c aseptic meningitis , the Achilles heel of mumps vaccines , has never been documented to be caused by Jeryl Lynn.\n\u201d In country after country , introduction of Urabe-based MMR vaccines have spawned outbreaks of aseptic meningitis and prompted withdrawal of the suspect MMR vaccine .\nIn several of these cases , Merck \u2019 s MMRII has been the primary beneficiary .\nSome researchers have argued , however , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of reduced efficacy .\nAccording to the authors above , \u201c a mathematical model using the Urabe or Jeryl Lynn strains , suggested that \u2026 the greater apparent safety \u2026 associated with the Jeryl Lynn strain is offset by the potentially greater effectiveness associated with the Urabe strain.\n\u201d In light of these competitive threats to its highly successful MMRII franchise , it \u2019 s not surprising that asking Merck scientists to oversee testing of the efficacy of its own mumps vaccine would create a conflict of interest , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , if the underlying efficacy of the vaccine was weak .\nThe DOJ \u2019 s decision also points to another unavoidable but potentially troubling conflict of interest \u2013 the department is part of the same Executive Branch of government as the FDA and CDC .\nUnder the Department of Health and Human Services , the FDA and CDC approve , recommend , and monitor vaccines , and they have repeatedly certified mumps-containing vaccines as effective .\nAllowing an alleged fraud to go on under their noses , involving a vaccine to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be something they would care to acknoweldge .\nThe fate of the lawsuit notwithstanding , serious new questions about children \u2019 s health are now in the public domain .\nIt will be worth watching whether regulators or legislators here or abroad ask Merck for convincing , current evidence that the mumps vaccine is working as promised , and that the public 's
