dirty by thoroughly investigating September 11 irregularities , in her June 4 , 2002 article for Online Journal \u201c Has the Establishment Left become a handmaiden for the Republican Right ?\n\u201d Some of these leftists have recently bashed alleged \u201c conspiracy theorists \u201d for implying that events surrounding September 11 might be more than a series of intelligence slip-ups and coincidences .\nConover mentioned that David Corn of The Nation recently trashed an article that appears on Michael Ruppert \u2019 s Internet site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruppert is not a \u201c real \u201d reporter .\nRuppert has published a timeline of events , some of which imply the CIA may have known about the September 11 attacks in advance and that our own government may have even been complicit .\nLeftist Norman Solomon , someone I admired greatly until now , has also attacked Ruppert .\nSolomon says Ruppert is \u201c expert at combining facts with unreliable reports and wild leaps of logic.\n\u201d Matthew Rothschild , editor of The Progressive , recently said he wouldn \u2019 t impute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand down and allow September 11 to happen .\nRothschild added that we do need a governmental commission to investigate September 11 irregularities , but that \u201c we don \u2019 t need crazy conspiracy theorists coming from the left.\n\u201d Do leftists such as Rothschild , Corn and Solomon have amnesia regarding our nation \u2019 s ( and particularly the CIA \u2019 s ) recent history ?\nOur own CIA and various Presidents have participated in , and/or knowingly allowed , the Watergate conspiracy , the Iran-contra conspiracy , the MHCHAOS conspiracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long list of other attacks on the American people .\nDoes that automatically mean the CIA also participated in a September 11 conspiracy ?\nOf course not , and no one has suggested that the CIA \u2019 s previous conspiracies against the public constitute \u201c proof \u201d that agency also conspired regarding September 11 .\nHowever , the previous conspiracies do show that our own CIA and government are indeed capable of conspiring against the American public .\nIn The Progressive , October 2001 , ( apparently before the amnesia set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The United States does not have clean hands in the world .\nThe history of the last fifty years is the history of U. S. war and repression in one Third World country after another .\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that the United States has acted as a terrorist from Guatemala to Iran , from El Salvador to Vietnam , from Chili to Indonesia .\nTo heighten the level of terror by waging all-out war against Afghanistan or any other country Bush is aiming his bombers at will serve no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same Matthew Rothschild says he wouldn \u2019 t impute extreme callousness to what he himself described as a terrorist-acting U. S. government , or to ( in his own earlier words ) the terror-heightening bomber , Bush ?\nLogical thinking is based on reality .\nHistorical reality shows that it makes sense to find it easy to impute extreme callousness and criminality to our own government officials , and that it is illogical to find it hard to do so .\nThe leftists criticizing \u201c conspiracy theorists \u201d should consider the following : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherently \u201c crazy.\n\u201d Any elementary logic text teaches that it would be a fallacy to believe all conspiracy theories are irrational merely because some may be .\n( 2 ) The Ivory Tower leftists are not really logical or sane in their criticism .\nFor example , they make their own illogical leap when they assume that all \u201c conspiracy theorists \u201d believe that any single CIA/governmental misdeed in itself constitutes absolute proof of further misconduct .\n( 3 ) \u201c Real \u201d reporting can include \u2013 in fact , has ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even \u201c leap of logic \u201d pieces that serve as art \u2013 in other words , pieces that stimulate readers to examine a list of events , think , and then draw their own conclusions .\nMost readers know the difference between a writer \u2019 s speculating and asserting a fixed and final conclusion .\nWhen Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein first looked into the Watergate conspiracy , they had no smoking gun .\nThey made no apologies for occasional \u201c leaps of logic \u201d during their process of investigation .\nThe movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d shows Woodward and Bernstein discussing circumstantial evidence .\nIn one scene , the reporters point out that if a person should happen to turn on a radio and hear nothing but classical music without commercials for a given length of time , that person could reasonably conclude he was listening to FM rather than AM radio .\n( This was a \u201c leap of logic \u201d that made sense at that time . )\nThe point of the Woodward/Bernstein illustration is that a person can draw rational conclusions from circumstantial evidence using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until late in their investigation that Woodward and Bernstein were able to connect all the Watergate dots , but at the time no Ivory Tower leftists suggested their use of inductive reasoning and their early explorations of mere circumstantial evidence amounted to a \u201c crazy conspiracy theory.\n\u201d Former CNN producer April Oliver once wrote that CNN came up with a new standard of journalistic proof when the network wanted to kill her story on the Pentagon \u2019 s illicit use of sarin nerve gas .\nThough Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research and cited multiple sources for the story , CNN insisted they come up with a smoking gun , or \u201c enough airtight proof to persuade a jury in a courtroom of law , \u201d according to Oliver .\nOliver stated that \u201c such a smoking gun is , of course , completely counter to the intent of a so-called \u2018 black operation , \u2019 the purpose of which is to cover up the truth so no one can ever \u2018 prove \u2019 what happened.\n\u201d Oliver pointed out that documents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c paper trail proving the story was probably non-existent.\n\u201d ( From \u201c Censored 1999 : The News That Didn \u2019 t Make The News And Why \u201d by Peter Phillips and Project Censored . )\nThe attempt to \u201c connect the dots \u201d between one aberrant news event and a long list of other similar irregularities ( even minus a smoking gun ) is not inherently \u201c crazy , \u201d but is in fact logical .\nWhat is illogical , is to suggest that all political events happen in a vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ( Land of Idols , St. Martin \u2019 s Press , 1994 ) politicians and corporate leaders naturally work to further their own monetary and power interests , often in a \u201c conspiratorial \u201d manner .\nTo believe otherwise is to believe in \u201c Coincidence Theory \u201d ( the truly nutty idea that the interests of the very wealthy are magically maintained by chance , year after year ) ; or \u201c Aberration Theory \u201d ( the blind-to-historical-reality-notion that dirty CIA tricks are atypical departures from the norm ) ; or \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the very wealthy and their intelligence-agency-protectors stupidly and repeatedly bumble their way into maintaining world domination , never using forethought ) ; or \u201c Somnambulist Theory \u201d ( the illogical view that world dominators sleepwalk through life without ever thinking of their vast wealth and how to keep it ) ; or \u201c Idiosyncrasy Theory \u201d ( the unthinking theory that \u201c stuff just happens \u201d in a way that furthers the interests of oil companies and other powerful folks \u2013 and that somehow it \u201c just happens \u201d the exact same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of time . )\nParenti also notes that the CIA is by definition conspiratorial , \u201c using covert actions and secret plans , many of which are of the most unsavory kind .\nWhat are covert operations if not conspiracies ?\n\u201d In his \u201c Dirty Truths \u201d ( City Lights Books , 1996 ) , Parenti points out that \u201c conspiracy \u201d can simply mean that ruling class individuals \u201c are aware of their interests , know each other personally , meet together privately and off the record , and try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anticipate and react to events and issues.\n\u201d Again , in logic , one makes pertinent leaps .\nFor example , if you have a dog in the house , and there is no way for that dog to exit or for any other dog to enter , and you come home and find dog excrement on your floor , you can make the reasonable leap that the dog is the source of the excrement .\nAre district attorneys and prosecutors \u201c crazy conspiracy theorists \u201d when they investigate criminal conspiracies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents , absent a smoking gun ?\nWhen these prosecutors argue a defendantis guilty beyond a reasonable doubt , are they arguing a \u201c crazy conspiracy theory ?\n\u201d The misguided refusal to admit that conspiracies exist , and in fact occur often , lets governmental wrongdoers off the hook and does not serve the public .\nApril Oliver says when she and fellow reporter Jack Smith investigated the Pentagon \u2019 s illicit use of nerve gas , critics serving powerful interests called them \u201c amateurs \u201d and \u201c left-leaning ideologues \u201d in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and therefore stamp out the message .\nSurprisingly , the Ivory Tower leftists now use similar epithets ( \u201c not real reporters , \u201d \u201c conspiracy theorists \u201d ) to mischaracterize and dismiss people who don \u2019 t buy the institutional spin regarding September 11 .\nI don \u2019 t believe the Ivory Tower leftists are motivated by a desire to serve powerful interests , but rather by the fact that they buy into the institutional propaganda regarding so-called \u201c conspiracy theories , \u201d and by their fear of becoming associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider that all actual historical conspiracies ( such as Watergate and Iran-contra ) were lightly substantiated \u201c theories \u201d in the early stages of investigation .\nInternet writers , including some of Online Journal \u2019 s contributors , were ahead of the curve when it came to identifying the Clinton impeachment as a form of conspiracy , or a hunting of the President .\nThose same writers were on the leading edge when it came to defining the election theft as a conspiracy .\nToday those writers are virtually the only ones courageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding September 11 .\nRaising the questions is not the exact same thing as postulating any \u201c theory , \u201d conspiracy or otherwise ; and it \u2019 s a heck of a lot more ethical , gutsy , worthwhile and , yes , logical , than cowering in an Ivory Tower , hurling epithets at conspiracy investigators and ( possibly inadvertently or unconsciously ) currying favor with some of the most reprehensible people in the country .", "author": "Carla Binion", "url": "https://911truth.org/leftist-reporters-deny-conspiracy-theories/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=leftist-reporters-deny-conspiracy-theories", "published": "Sat, 28 Aug 2021 20:22:14 +0000", "published_utc": 1630196534, "collection_utc": 1630188028}]
