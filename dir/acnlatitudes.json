amount and severity of tics experienced by individuals with Tourette Syndrome , giving new hope for an effective treatment .\nScientists from the University of Nottingham \u2019 s School of Psychology and School of Medicine used repetitive trains of stimulation to the median nerve ( MNS ) at the wrist to entrain rhythmic electrical brain activity \u2013 known as brain-oscillations \u2013 that are associated with the suppression of movements .\nThey found that rhythmic MNS is sufficient to substantially reduce tic frequency and tic intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Tourette \u2019 s .\nTheir findings have been published today in Current Biology .\nTourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is usually diagnosed between the ages of eight and 12 .\nIt causes involuntary sounds and movements called tics .\nTics are involuntary , repetitive , stereotyped movements and vocalizations that occur in bouts , typically many times in a single day , and are often preceded by a strong urge-to-tic , referred to as a premonitory urge ( PU ) .\nWe understand that the tics are caused by alterations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the formation of habits and the initiation of habitual movements .\nThese changes lead to hyper-excitability in the brain regions involved in generating movements .\nOur research successfully used pulses of electrical current , delivered at the wrist , to increase the strength of brain-oscillations that must ordinarily be reduced in strength to generate a movement , resulting in significantly reduced tics and in many cases removal of the urge-to-tic .\nThis work has huge potential for the development of a safe and effective treatment for tics with no side effects .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ took part in this study , which was funded by the charity Tourettes Action and the NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre .\nParticipants were observed for random 1-minute periods , during which they were given constant rhythmic pulses of the MNS to their right wrist , and 1-minute periods during which they received no stimulation .\nIn all cases the stimulation reduced the tics , and also the urge-to-tic , and had the most significant effect on those individuals with the most severe tics .\nOne of the participants was 21 year-old Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TS for three years and found out about the study through Tourettes Action who have been supporting him and his family .\nHe said : \u201c I \u2019 ve tried a lot of different medications , therapies , relaxation techniques , support groups and diet changes to try to relieve my Tourette \u2019 s and although I was skeptical I was keen to be involved in this study .\nThe whole experiment was very surreal .\nWhen the electrical pules on the wrist started to increase , the tic urges decreased , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was silent and still .\nFor a further three sessions I noticed the same result , also the stimulation did decrease my tics at home .\nAt the first session of the stimulation , I felt as if finally , a new treatment may have been found to free myself from my Tourette \u2019 s and wanted to cry with happiness .\n\u201c This breakthrough could change an individual \u2019 s mental stability in life and confidence , which is vital as Tourette \u2019 s Syndrome can destroy your life a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully change peoples lives for the good.\n\u201d The results of this study were quite remarkable , especially in those people with the most severe tics and showed that this type of stimulation has real potential as a treatment aid for Tourette \u2019 s .\nOur aim is to develop a wearable \u2018 watch-like \u2019 MNS stimulator that looks like an Apple watch or Fitbit and can be used by the individual outside of the clinic as and when they need to control their tics .\nBarbara Morera Maiquez , lead author on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tourettes Action said : \u201c Tourettes Action are delighted to support this ground breaking research .\nThere is no pharmaceutical treatment for Tourette Syndrome only drugs used to treat other conditions , currently the preferred treatments are psychological treatments \u2013 which are not easily available .\nThis wearable and self-managing treatment could potentially change the lives of thousands of people living with TS .\nWe will continue to support the team at the University of Nottingham as this amazing treatment

Covid", "content": "This article shared in Deceomber 2020 was organized by Karl Pfleger , PhD , of Stanford University .\nIt was addressed to all governments , public health officials , doctors , and healthcare workers and signed by more than 150 doctors , scientists and experts .\nResearch shows low vitamin D levels almost certainly promote COVID-19 infections , hospitalizations , and deaths .\nGiven its safety , we call for immediate widespread increased vitamin D intakes .\nVitamin D modulates thousands of genes and many aspects of immune function , both innate and adaptive .\nThe scientific evidence1 shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are associated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection .\n\u2022 Higher D levels are associated with lower risk of a severe case ( hospitalization , ICU , or death ) .\n\u2022 Intervention studies ( including RCTs ) indicate that vitamin D can be a very effective treatment .\n\u2022 Many papers reveal several biological mechanisms by which vitamin D influences COVID-19 .\n\u2022 Causal inference modeling , Hill \u2019 s criteria , the intervention studies & the biological mechanisms indicate that vitamin D \u2019 s influence on COVID-19 is very likely causal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well known to be essential , but most people do not get enough .\nTwo common definitions of inadequacy are deficiency < 20ng/ml ( 50nmol/L ) , the target of most governmental organizations , and insufficiency < 30ng/ml ( 75nmol/L ) , the target of several medical societies & experts.2 Too many people have levels below these targets .\nRates of vitamin D deficiency < 20ng/ml exceed 33 % of the population in most of the world , and most estimates of insufficiency < 30ng/ml are well over 50 % ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rates are even higher in winter , and several groups have notably worse deficiency : the overweight , those with dark skin ( especially far from the equator ) , and care home residents .\nThese same groups face increased COVID-19 risk .\nIt has been shown that 3875 IU ( 97mcg ) daily is required for 97.5 % of people to reach 20ng/ml , and 6200 IU ( 155mcg ) for 30ng/ml,4 intakes far above all national guidelines .\nUnfortunately , the report that set the US RDA included an admitted statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ~10x too low.4 Numerous calls in the academic literature to raise official recommended intakes had not yet resulted in increases by the time SARS-CoV-2 arrived .\nNow , many papers indicate that vitamin D affects COVID-19 more strongly than most other health conditions , with increased risk at levels < 30ng/ml ( 75nmol/L ) and severely greater risk < 20ng/ml ( 50nmol/L ) .1 1 The evidence was comprehensively reviewed ( 188 papers ) through mid-June [ ] & more recent publications are increasingly compelling [ ; ; ] .\n( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Castillo et al \u2019 s RCT results . )\n2 E.g .\n: 20ng/ml : National Academy of Medicine ( US , Canada ) , European Food Safety Authority , Germany , Austria , Switzerland , Nordic Countries , Australia , New Zealand , & .\n30ng/ml : Endocrine Society , American Geriatrics Soc.\n, & .\nSee also [ ] .\n3 [ ; ; ] Applies to China , India , Europe , US , etc .\nEvidence to date suggests the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic sustains itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low vitamin D , and that deaths are concentrated largely in those with deficiency .\nThe mere possibility that this is so should compel urgent gathering of more vitamin D data .\nEven without more data , the preponderance of evidence indicates that increased vitamin D would help reduce infections , hospitalizations , ICU admissions , & deaths .\nDecades of safety data show that vitamin D has very low risk : Toxicity would be extremely rare with the recommendations here .\nThe risk of insufficient levels far outweighs any risk from levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection against COVID-19 , and this is notably different from drugs & vaccines .\nVitamin D is much safer than steroids , such as dexamethasone , the most widely accepted treatment to have also demonstrated a large COVID-19 benefit .\nVitamin D \u2019 s safety is more like that of face masks .\nTherefore , we call on all governments , doctors , and healthcare workers worldwide to immediately recommend and implement efforts appropriate to their adult populations to increase vitamin D , at least until the end of the pandemic .\nSpecifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources sufficient to achieve 25 ( OH ) D serum levels over 30ng/ml ( 75nmol/L ) , a widely endorsed minimum with evidence of reduced COVID-19 risk .\n\u2022 Recommend to adults vitamin D intake of 4000 IU ( 100mcg ) daily ( or at least 2000 IU ) in the absence of testing .\n4000 IU is widely regarded as safe.5 \u2022 Recommend that adults at increased risk of deficiency due to excess weight , dark skin , or living in care homes may need higher intakes ( eg , 2x ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too low or high .\n\u2022 Recommend that adults not already receiving the above amounts get 10,000 IU ( 250mcg ) daily for 2-3 weeks ( or until achieving 30ng/ml if testing ) , followed by the daily amount above .\nThis practice is widely regarded as safe .\nThe body can synthesize more than this from sunlight under the right conditions ( e.g.\n, a summer day at the beach ) .\nAlso , the NAM ( US ) and EFSA ( Europe ) both label this a \u201c No Observed Adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance intake .\n\u2022 Measure 25 ( OH ) D levels of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients and treat with calcifediol or D3 , to at least remedy insufficiency < 30ng/ml ( 75nmol/L ) , possibly with a protocol along the lines of or , until evidence supports a better protocol .\nMany factors are known to predispose individuals to higher risk from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 , such as age , being male , comorbidities , etc.\n, but inadequate vitamin D is by far the most easily and quickly modifiable risk factor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect .\nVitamin D is inexpensive and has negligible

didn \u2019 t care in the least where we were living .\nWe just wanted to spare our son the intense pain he was going through .\nWhen he was 10 years old , our son David almost died from debilitating conventional medications for a serious case of Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) .\nFortunately , with professional help and self-determination , David was weaned from those drugs , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost losing our son I feel a moral obligation to share our story .\nI pray that others who may be in need of answers , as we were , may find the path they need .\nOur son has genetically-inherited Tourette syndrome .\nThe initial symptoms came on gradually , starting at around age five .\nInitial tics were eye-rolling and throat-clearing .\nA practitioner advised us that David \u2019 s eye-rolling was due to his weak vision , for which he got corrective glasses .\nHis throat-clearing was dismissed as allergies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bright and artistic , an educational psychologist said he had attention deficit disorder .\nHe also received a diagnosis of central auditory processing disorder and sensory dysfunction .\nHe was given an Individual Educational Plan at school .\nAbout two years later , symptoms worsened .\nIt was just before David \u2019 s 10th birthday .\nMultiple severe tics ( including some that were self-injurious ) , major OCD symptoms , and depression came on very suddenly .\nAlong with this were anxiety and incredibly intense symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgoing , bright , and social to being withdrawn , anxious , antisocial , phobic , and disinterested in everything .\nExamples of his OCD were repetitive actions to get things \u201c just right , \u201d obsessive fears , and phobias .\nA pediatric psychiatrist later told us that David exhibited \u201c Tourettic OCD , \u201d a condition in which tics and OCD tend to morph into one another .\nWe took David to a neurologist , who diagnosed Tourette syndrome and recommended the antipsychotic medication Haldol .\nWe were initially resistant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his school , we relented .\n( Editor : Haloperidol or Haldol used to be the medication of choice for Tourette syndrome , and is now used less often due to safety concerns . )\nDavid was on standard prescription medication for almost a year but experienced nasty side effects .\nThe drug therapy did not make much of an improvement with his tics , and it worsened his obsessive-compulsive tendencies considerably .\nHaldol left him \u201c zombified , \u201d with no motivation .\nEventually , it resulted in a drug-induced psychosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , the treatment he received in the hospital included more medications , including Luvox ( an antidepressant ) and Zyprexa ( an atypical antipsychotic ) .\nThings went from bad to horrifying .\nWhen I suggested it was the Haldol that was making him psychotic , they treated me like an ignorant hysterical person .\nBut I had already started reading Peter Breggin \u2019 s book Your Drug May Be Your Problem .\nWhen they released David back into my care , I started taking him to Dr. Tanya Murphy at Shands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went for a PANDAS evaluation ( it was negative ) .\nBut her team also helped wean him off the medications .\nMeanwhile , I had to withdraw him from school .\nOne day I went to visit a friend who did art therapy for terminally-ill patients .\nShe had a print copy of the Latitudes newsletter on her table , and the rest is history .\n( Latitudes is now online-only . )\nAfter reading the first issue , for the first time I had hope that we would find help .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragement and direction the Latitudes newsletters gave me .\nIn fact , out of gratitude , I remain a member of Latitudes.org to support it , even though we no longer need it for ourselves .\nI share the website and director Sheila DeMare \u2019 s books whenever I can .\nWe began natural therapies that I truly believed saved his life\u2013no hyperbole !\nWe saw an integrative medical doctor who was trained conventionally but specialized in natural medicine .\nShe and her team worked together on my son \u2019 s testing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made any effort to learn what was actually causing David \u2019 s imbalances .\nThe whole process was a real eye-opener and made so much sense .\nOne of his doctors found David had high mercury levels , and efforts began to detoxify him from heavy metals .\nWe relied mostly on a chlorella supplement , followed by the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid .\nDuring this time , he was also seeing an excellent acupuncture therapist specializing in other natural therapies like reflexology , Chinese cupping detox , and biofeedback resonance therapy .\nNotably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Candida albicans in his digestive tract .\nI understand this is not a unique finding , with many families and integrative practitioners reporting the same .\nIn my son \u2019 s case , we found Candida Clear by the supplement company NOW to effectively eradicate the candida .\n( The product contains herbs and caprylic acid , a fatty acid . )\nHe was also on a protocol of vitamins , minerals , and amino acids approved by his doctor .\nOf these , I always suspected that magnesium seemed the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn that connection , I also found Epsom salt baths were beneficial .\nFor years , David had a bath most evenings with 2 cups Epsom salts in a tub of warm water and approximately a 20-minute soak .\nHe drank cupfuls of pure water or chamomile tea while in the tub , too .\nHe used Epsom salt foot baths and sometimes soaked a washcloth in a strong Epsom solution and applied it to troublesome tic areas on his body .\nHe told me this brought relief .\nThe efforts described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we discovered many food-related and environmental triggers through trial and error .\nThese could aggravate or trigger David \u2019 s tics and OCD behaviors .\nWe learned that foods with these items could increase David \u2019 s tics .\nThe degree of response seemed to depend on his overall health , stress level , energy , other exposures , etc .\n\u2022 Artificial sweeteners like Nutrasweet ( also known as aspartame ) and Splenda ( sucralose ) We had allergy tests conducted and did a process of food elimination to rule out any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t seem to have any natural food allergies per se , though he does have a mild peanut sensitivity .\nI \u2019 m aware that some people are allergic to or have sensitivities to any number of foods like dairy , wheat ( gluten ) , corn , tomato , banana , or beef , etc.\n, and reactions to these can aggravate tics .\nI \u2019 ve read that the list of potential food triggers others have reported is wide-ranging and depends on the individual .\nMy son was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to food-related ones , by his observations .\nThese included chlorine ( he avoids swimming pools now ) and most strong smells , like perfumes , household cleaners , and air fresheners .\nHe also reacts negatively to dust mites and mold exposure .\nSome years later , we saw an excellent allergist who ran extensive tests and diagnosed David with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity , which helped explain much of his extreme reactivity , including to the many chemicals used to make conventional pharmaceuticals !\nAs mentioned before , David showed hypersensitivity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , touch , sight , and sounds from a young age .\nWe enrolled him in specialized occupational therapy at age 9 for six months , and that helped reduce the extent of his sensitivities .\nWe learned techniques like skin brushing and other helpful skills to assist in reducing his hypersensitivity .\nI \u2019 ve heard from many folks with Tourette \u2019 s who complain of sensory factors or who have a diagnosis of Sensory Integration Dysfunction .\nThat said , even though he is doing very well now , David still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he wears his sox inside out because the seams drive him nuts !\nAcupuncture has been a help to David , as has reflexology and biofeedback .\nHe has also seen a chiropractor specializing in upper cervical chiropractic work ( see www.nucca.org ) .\nThis practitioner used gentle pressure methods to help re-align David \u2019 s neck and upper spine area .\nTiccing of the head , neck , shoulders , etc.\n, can result in skeletal misalignment .\nMisalignments , in turn , can lead to painful neuromuscular problems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also had cognitive behavioral therapy for the OCD , starting age 11 .\nNow a young adult , David maintains a healthy diet , plus he takes supplements such as vitamins , minerals , herbs , and certain amino acids as his \u201c treatments.\n\u201d He also studiously avoids triggers that could increase his tics and OCD symptoms .\nGratefully , he has regained his outgoing , social nature , enjoys pursuing his musical and artistic talents , and has a good job .\nMost of his friends and co-workers are unaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tells them .\nThat \u2019 s how beneficial the natural treatment approach has been for my son .\nI shudder when I recall how

"Study Finds Harmful Autoantibodies in PANDAS", "content": "Published with attribute to the PandasNetwork.org for this summary .\nThe Pandas Network has been instrumental in advocating for research in this field .\nA group of researchers has recently shown that plasma serum taken from kids who have been diagnosed with PANDAS and who also responded well to IVIG treatment contained antibodies that bind to and inhibit a specific type of neuron found in the basal ganglia .\nIt has been proposed that PANDAS results from post-infectious antibodies that target the basal ganglia .\nThe striatum consists of the caudate and putamen .\nIt is the largest part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input nucleus and serves to integrate synaptic inputs from limbic and cortical regions .\nOnly about 5 % of the neurons in the striatum are so-called interneurons .\nInterneurons connect different regions of the brain and form communication nodes that are important for coordinating activities .\nInterneurons can be classified based on their expression of various markers .\nA small subset of interneurons , called cholinergic interneurons ( CINs ) , is characterized by expression of choline acetyltransferase ( ChAT ) .\nAlthough few in number , these CINs are key regulators of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function and are known to be reduced in number in adults who have Tourette \u2019 s syndrome .\nAlso , selective experimental depletion of CINs in healthy mice yields repetitive behavioral disorders .\nThese facts suggest CIN dysregulation could play a role in PANDAS .\nIn a pilot study , antibodies from 5 children with rigorously characterized PANDAS showed significantly higher binding to CINs in mouse striatal tissue than antibodies from age- and gender-matched healthy controls .\nThe experiments generally involve incubating striatal neurons with the subject \u2019 s plasma serum , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluorescent staining and imaging techniques to detect and quantify the antibodies bound to the neuron .\nThe results of the pilot study were confirmed by elevated antibody binding to CINs , but not to other striatal neurons , both in the original 5 PANDAS patients and in two additional independent groups of PANDAS patients , and in both mouse and post-mortem human striatal tissue .\nThe results were consistent across 27 PANDAS patients in total .\nMoreover , the researchers showed that the antibody binding from the PANDAS patients inhibited activity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PANDAS patients after successful treatment with IVIG exhibited reduced binding to the CINs compared to the antibodies taken before IVIG treatment .\nAlso , the reduction in antibody binding was strongly correlated with the amount of symptom improvement .\nThe findings of these researchers support a novel hypothesis that PANDAS involves antibodies binding to and inhibiting activity of CINs in the basal ganglia .\nThey also suggest important directions for future research , validation of PANDAS diagnoses , and future treatments .\n[ 1 ] Antibodies From Children With PANDAS Bind Specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Activity , Jian Xu , Ph.D. , Rong-Jian Liu , Ph.D. , Shaylyn Fahey , B.S.\n, Luciana

medicines don \u2019 t seem to help him .\nWhat most concerns me is that the summer months can bring on several simultaneous tics and mood issues .\nFrom what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments , heat , and increased activity are tic triggers , along with pesticides on food .\nYou stress the importance of identifying triggers , but what should I do about environmental triggers that I can \u2019 t manage ?\nFor example , I \u2019 ve noticed that keeping my son on a routine , making sure he gets adequate sleep , and having healthy foods all help reduce his tics .\nI know that limiting processed foods and sugar intake is also extremely important and makes a big difference for his tics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I don \u2019 t know how to limit triggers associated summer activities like playing outside on a

these factors .\nBefore addressing these particular issues , I would be remiss if I didn \u2019 t point out that the \u201c seasonal allergies \u201d your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and blinking , may be contributing to the overall level of summer tics .\nI \u2019 d suggest you consider getting your son tested by an allergist for common allergens such as pollen , animal dander , mold , and dust mites

treatment\u2014although not all states require this for residences .\nThe products can harm children and adults .\npets , and wildlife .\nYoung kids like your child are particularly vulnerable because their immune and nervous systems are still developing .\nDue to their small body size , they are close to the ground and likely to want to play in the grass .\nSports fields may also be treated , not just lawns .\nCompanies usually suggest staying off the treated grounds for a day or two , but some advocates say there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this timeline , and it should at least be three days .\nFreshly treated lawns are a classic example of where avoidance is clearly the best approach .\nThere is no easy remedy to remove the toxins after exposure .\nNo one is suggesting that your child should not be able to play on grass ( unless he were highly allergic to grasses ! )\n.\nBut since you have noticed that treated lawns seem to trigger tics , you would want to err on the side of caution .\nTry to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a few days after any treatment that you are aware of .\nIf your son plays in a common area , like at an apartment complex or a public park , request a copy of their treatment schedule .\nOrganic food is always preferable , yet it is often more expensive and is not always easy to find .\nYou may have heard about the dirty dozen , or the \u201c dirty twelve \u201d

referred to me at age 8 for a functional vision assessment .\nEducational testing had shown him to be at a high risk for vision perceptual difficulties .\nThough Brent had always passed the vision screenings given at school , he had never received a developmental vision evaluation , which assesses far more than just acuity .\nBrent liked math but hated reading .\nFurther , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a classroom behavior problem .\nHis symptoms and case history revealed classic vision-related learning dysfunction : avoidance of coloring activities , reversals in writing , frequent confusion of small words ( i.e .\non-no ; saw-was ) , extreme light sensitivity , rubbing of eyes , and complaints of eyes hurting , and unusual blinking when focusing .\nHis development reportedly had been normal , with the exception of an atrial septal repair at age two .\nI found that while Brent had perfect eyesight , his functional visual skills \u2014focusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 were all inadequate .\nAs is frequently the case , his visual perceptual skills tested low as well .\nMany children are given the impossible task of processing visual information that they can not adequately bring into focus .\nThey are expected to comprehend reading material when they can not move their eyes together accurately and efficiently .\nWhen they have academic problems , they are told to \u201c try harder.\n\u201d After a period of \u201c trying harder , \u201d they often develop self-image problems , act out in class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disordered , hyperactive , dyslexic , lazy , etc .\nBrent received developmental vision therapy through 16 in-office sessions over a period of six months , and he routinely practiced home activities with parental support .\nThe change in Brent \u2019 s attitude toward school , as well as his ability to focus and attend to tasks , was significant .\nHe was then referred to a reading clinic for tutoring in reading strategies .\nIn a recent follow-up session , two years after therapy , Brent \u2019 s visual progress was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in school and even volunteers to read aloud in class .\nBrent \u2019 s case is typical .\nFar too many children struggle to perform academically when they simply have not developed the functional visual skills to do so .\nUnfortunately , news of this type of therapy is often not available to educators , parents , and individuals who could benefit .\nBrent had a very serious reading problem , and we tried several avenues with no success before being referred to Dr. Landis .\nThe results with vision therapy were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises to do at home , and we did them together , every day , for several months .\nTo my surprise , they were actually fun , and there was enough variety that Brent didn \u2019 t get bored .\nI particularly remember a set of special \u201c binoculars \u201d that had visual images Brent was required to bring together by focusing his eyes .\n( I used them myself and found they helped strengthen my own eye muscles . )\nIn addition to several other activities , there was a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he was correctly balanced and moving his weight properly , it would rotate quickly and smoothly .\nAs I understand it , the use of this board was intended to improve his left/right brain functioning .\nNot only did visual skills respond to Dr. Landis \u2019 s therapy , but Brent \u2019 s overall coordination improved considerably .\nAfter completion of therapy , Dr. Landis recommended a special reading center for remediation .\nPrevious tutoring had not paid off , but Brent was now able to catch up over three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months .\nEditor \u2019 s note : Though cost varies , a complete course of vision therapy is about $ 1,500 .\nThe treatment is often covered by insurance .\nContact the national organization , College of Optometrists in Vision Development ( COVD ) , for names of optometrists who are credentialed in providing vision therapy

@ @ @ @ @ @ in other medical conditions , triggers can vary from person to person .\nResults were shared with the Tourette Association of America ( previously : Tourette Syndrome Association ) , our ACN newsletters , and featured in our first book Natural Treatments for Tics and Tourette \u2019 s .\nWe assumed our survey would be the first of other large-scale surveys on triggers .\nYet , almost 20 years later , there have not been any significant surveys .\n( I should qualify that : There was a targeted survey by the TSA/TAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were withheld from the public .\nI was told the medical board thought it might \u201c confuse people.\n\u201d ) .\nHere \u2019 s trigger feedback I collected from the audience as the keynote speaker at the Atlanta Tourette Conference ( 2016 ) .\nThe absence of comprehensive surveys on this condition and triggers is conspicuous by its absence .\nSurveys are a low-cost , revealing approach .\nIn my latest book , Tourette Syndrome : Stop Your Tics by Learning What Triggers Them , I compare research \u201c interest \u201d across other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s .\nThe graphs below highlight areas that are of popular interest and highly relevant to tics : allergy , triggers , and diet .\nThe numbers shown are higher than actual studies published on the topic .\nFor example , there are only a few , not 10 , published studies on Tourette syndrome and diet .\nThe numbers in the charts reflect published studies on the topic along with related research generated by a PubMed search .\nA comparison of these numbers gives the reader a sense of the trends .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of open-mindedness .\nThey fail to collaborate with integrative physicians or medical and scientific experts outside their narrow disciplines .\nFurther , they do not properly survey those dealing with Tourette syndrome to learn from their experiences .\nAs a result , most researchers lack a basic understanding of how these factors can affect the nervous system .\nNOTE : There is not a direct one-to-one comparison for each element of these charts .\nFor example , there is currently a greater incidence of autism and ADHD than Tourette \u2019 s .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere is a fourfold increase in the incidence of headaches and migraine among children and adolescents with Tourette \u2019 s .\nEven though migraine is more common than Tourette \u2019 s , given the migraine-Tourette connection we should be vigorously exploring some of the same research areas for tics as occur for migraine .\nClearly , research on Tourette \u2019 s for the topics highlighted in these charts is negligible .\nThe tic community should ask : What excuse could there be for this ?\nThese graphs were developed four years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can confirm that the relative profile remains sadly accurate .\nIgnoring the role of the \u201c environment \u201d in tics is unethical The standard advice to Tourette syndrome sufferers is : \u201c It \u2019 s a genetic condition .\nTics will come and go ; there \u2019 s nothing you can do about them.\n\u201d Patients and families hear this so often , it colors their observations and disempowers them\u2014they don \u2019 t even think to look for what might be triggering tics .\nWhen the environment is a factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medications , physical imbalances , sensory influences , allergies , and exposure to toxins all have the potential to affect symptoms .\nWhy is research for Tourette \u2019 s so constipated and inadequate ?\nCountless families and patients have reported a connection between tics and a range of environmental factors .\nWhy are they being ignored ?\nI propose it \u2019 s because the topics fall outside the mindset of conventional neurology , psychiatry , psychology , and behavioral therapy .\nYou see , these are the main medical disciplines represented on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national organization , Tourette Association of America .\nSee for yourself .\nThe Tourette Association of America needs to expand its areas of expertise and research .\nTheir ongoing failure to do so makes us question their motives .\nIn fact , we have suggested that the organization be investigated for stonewalling and blocking information from the public and medical community that could change the direction of research .\nCollaboration with world-class specialists in diverse medical areas would
