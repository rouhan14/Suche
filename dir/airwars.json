parliament to vote on resolution to protect civilians from explosive weapon use in cities", "content": "Pressure is growing on countries to support an international political declaration to restrict the use of explosive weapons in urban areas .\nThe Belgian parliament is considering adopting a resolution to help protect civilians from the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas .\nThe resolution calls for Belgium \u2019 s active participation in ongoing diplomatic negotiations among nations on an international political declaration to avoid the use of explosive weapons in populated areas , to help reduce civilian suffering .\nIn a joint statement published on January 12th , Airwars , Humanity & Inclusion , PAX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Members of Parliament in Belgium to support the resolution .\nThe statement reads : \u201c Such resolution is a good step in the right direction as it clearly demands the Belgian Federal Government for an unequivocal commitment against the use of high-impact explosive weapons in populated areas , in line with the presumption of non-use ; a recognition of the \u201c domino effects \u201d of wide-range explosive weapons ; and a commitment to victim assistance and unconditional access to humanitarian aid .\nAfter dozens of parliamentary questions , motions and public hearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luxembourg and the UK , the adoption of this resolution would be pioneering as it is the first of its kind.\n\u201d On January 6th , the National Defence Commission of the Belgian Federal Parliament came together to discuss a draft of Resolution 1222/1 on the protection of civilians from the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas .\nPrior to the hearing , Airwars , Humanity & Inclusion , Pax Christi Vlaanderen and PAX for Peace sent Members of Parliament a letter with key recommendations .\nIf the Resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be a key event in the ongoing negotiations between nations on an international political declaration .\nSince October 2019 , more than 70 countries , including Belgium , have participated in diplomatic negotiations led by Ireland to draft such a declaration .\nDuring the parliamentary hearing on January 6th , experts from the Belgian Red Cross and Humanity & Inclusion ( HI ) gave short presentations on the importance of the proposed resolution .\nAnne Hery , director of advocacy and institutional relations at HI , stated : \u201c How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of precaution and proportionality of attack when using artillery or mortar shells in places where children , women and men are concentrated , or when bombing near infrastructures vital for the survival of populations , such as hospitals , schools or even power stations ?\nThe devastation in Syria , Yemen , Iraq , Ukraine , Libya , more recently in Nagorno Karabakh or in the Tigray region , in Ethiopia , forces us to rethink the methods , tactics and choice of weapons of war used today.\n\u201d Samuel Cogolati , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the initiators of the resolution .\nMr Cogolati told Airwars : \u201c Today \u2019 s armed conflicts in Yemen , Syria and Libya are not the same as those of 20 , 30 or 50 years ago .\nBecause although conflicts are increasingly urban , battles are most often fought with weapons or ammunition systems with indiscriminate effects , initially designed for use on open battlefields.\n\u201d According to Cogolati , the draft resolution is \u201c simply an attempt to respond to the call of the UN Secretary-General , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The text itself was written in close cooperation with civil society.\n\u201d The text calls upon the Belgian federal government to not only avoid the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas , but also requests that the government actively pushes for the recognition of reverberating effects of explosive weapons and victim assistance as key elements of the international political declaration .\nMr Cogolati also emphasised the reverberating effects for civilians of the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects , such as the destruction of vital infrastructure , contamination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves of forced displacement .\nIn October 2020 , Airwars and PAX for Peace presented their joint report Seeing through the Rubble on the long-term effects of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas to MPs in Belgium , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom , France and Germany .\nCamilla Roberti , advocacy officer for Humanity & Inclusion , is hopeful that the Resolution will be adapted , but also has reservations .\n\u201c We remain concerned as Belgium reiterates its belief that IHL is strong enough and that strict compliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ to limit civilian harm during urban fighting ] .\nOn the contrary , we believe that IHL , which remains crucial , must be coupled with policies and standards that enhance its effectiveness during conflict and address the harm caused to civilians and civilian infrastructure during and after conflict.\n\u201d Roberti also warns that Belgium \u201c doesn \u2019 t seem to take into account the indiscriminate effects caused by these weapons even in those cases where attacks appear \u2018 legitimate \u2019 .\nThis is something we call on all States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very centre of the future political declaration , as it will be the only way to put the people at the centre and prevent harm to civilians.\n\u201d Whilst Belgian parliamentarians are focused on pushing Belgium to become a pioneer in the protection of civilians , the Belgian Ministry of Defence continues to refuse taking responsibility for any civilian harm its own actions may have caused .\nDuring a recent public event \u2018 New Military Technologies : What About Drones ?\n\u2019 , organised by PAX Christi Vlaanderen , Vrede Vzw and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 2nd 2020 , Chief of Staff of the Belgian Air Forces , Colonel Geert de Decker , stated that \u201c Neither in Libya , nor in Iraq , we have any reports of civilian casualties as a result of Belgian interventions .\nThat is one of the things that we pride ourselves on .\nYou are never one hundred per cent sure , but we do everything possible to avoid making civilian casualties.\n\u201d Belgium has , in fact , been implicated in several civilian harm incidents that were officially acknowledged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to answer on its possible involvement in these incidents .\nIt remains unknown whether it was Belgium or France which was responsible for five airstrikes which led to the confirmed deaths of at least 22 civilians .\nWhen the Belgian Ministry of Defence was asked about their possible involvement in these strikes , officials told Airwars : \u201c For the year 2017 , BAF [ Belgian Armed Forces ] was certainly not involved in all events \u201d , indicating that the Belgians were in fact involved in some of those events .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to state that its actions in Syria and Iraq have caused zero civilian casualties .\nOn September 30th , 11 international and Belgian NGOs sent an open letter to then Minister of Defence Phillipe Goffin , calling on the Belgian government to finally take concrete steps to improve its transparency and accountability for civilian harm .\nThe Belgian parliament will likely vote on whether to adopt Resolution 1222/1 by February 2021 .", "author": "Laurie Treffers", "url":

.\nIn it latest data project , Airwars has published comprehensive mapping of more than 3,000 air and artillery strike in Libya since 2012 .\nThe new data covers all known locally reported strikes to date , conducted by all parties to an on-and-off civil war that is currently on pause , after last year \u2019 s UN-brokered ceasefire deal .\nA team of researchers , geolocators and specialist volunteers for several months meticulously researched the location of every claimed strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placing the majority at least to neighbourhood level , and with many civilian harm events now including more exact locations .\nThe new strike data joins more than 230 reported civilian harm events in Libya since 2012 which are already published by Airwars .\nThe new data and mapping has been visualised by Glasgow-based design studio Rectangle , an innovator when it comes to visualising conflict data .\nDaniel Powers and Lizzie Malcolm of Rectangle say about the project : \u201c The new maps visualise these incidents by civilian fatalities , militant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each belligerent .\nThe maps are navigable by a histogram of the map data over time , to try to provide an overview of a particularly complex conflict.\n\u201d The new interactive map enables users to explore the conflict in Libya and its impact on different regions of the country .\nFilters make it possible to see which faction bombed how much in which region ; and who caused the most reported harm to civilians -revealing a clear correlation between the use of explosive weapons in urban areas , and non-combatant deaths .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Libya conflict from 2012 to date has claimed the lives of up to 1,100 civilians through air and artillery strikes .\nAdditionally the map also depicts claimed deaths among militant groups .\nClaudia Gazzini , senior analyst at the International Crisis Group says of the new mapping : \u201c This is a great instrument that visualises extremely clearly how airstrikes have affected Libya throughout its ten-year transition .\nIn a glance we see with extreme clarity where airstrikes have occurred , how many civilian casualties have there been as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a timeline above the mapping shows , Libya has witnessed intense periods of fighting since 2012 \u2013 with the LNA \u2019 s offensive on Tripoli between April 2019 and June 2020 by far the heaviest .\nInga Kristina Trauthig , Libya Research Fellow at ICSR , recalls some of the shocking attacks that occurred during the battle : \u201c Buried in this quantitative data are infamous examples , like the airstrike at a military school on the capital , Tripoli which killed over 30 people in January 2020 ; as well as numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tripoli , in late July 2019 conducted by the Libyan National Army in violation of international humanitarian law.\n\u201d Gazzini adds : \u201c What emerges extremely clearly is also how damaging the 14 months war on Tripoli have been , the majority of strikes and civilian casualties has occurred within that time frame , in many cases by unknown actors.\n\u201d Violence towards civilians in Tripoli during the recent siege had also been visualised in detail for Airwars by Rectangle in innovative mapping .\n\u201c What the data really shows us is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visualisation powerfully brings across how heavily Libya is affected by airstrikes , \u201d says Inga Kristina Trauthig .\n\u201c Being able to zoom in and out shows how virtually the entire country is affected but at the same time clear hotspots like Benghazi and Derna in Eastern Libya as well as significant differences with regard to the time periods become clear \u2013 such as the correlation between increased US airstrikes in Sirte with the fight against Islamic State.\n\u201d Clicking on the map reveals more detail about individual events , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths .\nCivilian casualty incidents are also linked to the Airwars database , where more granular analysis can be found .\nArabic language researchers on the project included \u2013 among others \u2013 Osama Mansour , Shihab Halep and Mohammed al-Jumaily .\nVolunteers included Samuel Brownsword , Eleftheria Kousta , Douglas Statt , Vasiliki Touhouliotis and Anna Zahn .\nAnd Clive Vella , Giacomo Nanni and Riley Mellen worked on the geolocation team .\nNew graphs compare strikes , civilian harm from Trump , Obama and Bush Also being introduced by Airwars are new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers grouped by US president \u2013 initially for the conflicts in Iraq and Syria , and in Somalia .\nThe US-led war against so-called Islamic State has seen more than 34,000 declared international air and artillery strikes since 2014 .\nUsing official Coalition data , Airwars modelling now shows that a slim majority of those strikes took place during Barack Obama \u2019 s second term .\nHowever more than twice the level of civilian harm was reported under Trump than Obama \u2013 partly a reflection of the intensity of the latter stages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about possible relaxation of standards to protect non combatants .\nIn Somalia too , new graphics show that US actions against Al Shabaab under Donald Trump surged to their highest levels since counterterrorism actions began in 2007 .\nAlleged civilian harm under Trump was more than double that of George W Bush and Barack Obama \u2019 s presidencies combined .", "author": "Oliver Imhof", "url":

rival political factions agreed to form a transitional government on February 5th , further cementing a June ceasefire meant to end the country \u2019 s civil war .\nAfter a lengthy UN-mediated process , the 73 delegates of the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum ( LPDF ) voted for Mohammad Menfi as head of the Presidency Council ; Abdul Hamid Dbeibah as Prime Minister ; and Mossa Al-Koni and Abdullah Hussein Al-Lafi as members of the Presidency Council .\nThey will lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for December .\nThe list had support from across the divided nation .\nMenfi , a former General National

administration will be tasked with implementing it .\nHowever little is known about the new interim government \u2019 s policy plans as no concrete proposals have so far been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges are the disarmament of militias , and the withdrawal of foreign fighters from Libya .\nForeign support played a significant role in recent stages of the civil war , with the United Arab Emirates

between parties , many of whom had been only recently been locked in bitter conflict .\n\u201c For the first time in years we are witnessing a ( commitment ) to political progress by all parties instead of moving to an armed conflict , \u201d a UN source familiar with the dialogue told Airwars .\n\u201c This is the first fruitful outcome from the whole process.\n\u201d General Haftar , head of the Libyan National Army which tried to seize control of Tripoli in 2019 , had unsuccessfully sought to block the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim Brotherhood-backed militias also opposed the dialogue and tried to disrupt it at various points , the source claimed .\nAnother issue of concern is appeasing international sponsors of a conflict in which at least 788 civilians have been killed since 2012

which has seen Turkish troops pushing deeper than ever before into northern Iraq \u2013 also saw the deaths of thirteen Turkish civilian and military captives in a highly controversial attack , Airwars monitoring of the region shows .\nOn February 10th , the Turkish Armed Forces launched a major air and ground operation codenamed Operation Claw Eagle 2 against the Kurdistan Workers \u2019 Party ( PKK ) in the Gara Mountain in Dohuk Governorate in northern Iraq .\nThe PKK is designated as a terrorist group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among others , though some Kurds view the group as a liberation organisation .\nTurkey has launched a number of operations against the PKK in northern Iraq in recent years , the most recent being Operations Claw Eagle and Tiger in June 2020 , which took place in the Qandil Mountains , the Sinjar District , and Makhmur .\nAccording to Turkish military expert Levent Kemal , the military campaigns against the PKK have been effective in reducing the group \u2019 s operational capabilities .\n\u201c The PKK \u2019 s [ ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced thanks to these operations .\nIn particular , PKK infiltration routes have been under control and guerrilla hideouts in the Bradost area have been destroyed .\nIn the West , in Zakho and Duhok areas , cooperation between the Turkish Armed Forces and the Kurdistan Democtatic Party \u2019 s ( KDP ) Peshmerga forces annihilated PKK \u2019 s presence near the Turkish border , forcing the PKK to retreat further south \u201d .\nAccording to the Turkish Ministry of Defence , the purpose of the most recent operation was to clear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said had been used as a transit area for PKK fighters to cross from Iraq to Turkey ; and also to secure the border to prevent what the ministry described as an imminent \u201c large-scale attack \u201d on Turkish forces in Iraq .\nAnother stated goal of Operation Claw Eagle 2 was to rescue Turkish captives held by the PKK .\nMore than a dozen civilians and military personnel had been abducted by the PKK within Turkey in recent years , and were being held captive in Duhok .\nThe early hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reportedly bombing six villages in the area , causing severe damage to local vineyards and agricultural lands .\nThe Turkish Minister of Defence , Hulusi Akar , claimed that 50 PKK targets were destroyed including air raid shelters , ammunition depots , and headquarters in the initial aerial bombardment .\nWhile no civilians were believed harmed during the attack as almost all inhabitants had apparently fled the area , locals say that the operation had nevertheless severely affected their livelihoods .\nKurdish analyst Abdulla Hawez assessed the impact of the campaign on local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t killed in the operation , \u201c Turkish warplanes and drones were extensively bombarding dozens of locations ; overall 90 villages were affected and were within the scope of the operation \u201d .\nThe airstrikes were followed by a ground attack led by Turkish commandos against the People \u2019 s Defence Forces ( HPG ) , the military wing of the PKK .\nAccording to Minister Akar , 50 PKK fighters were killed in the operations and three members of the Turkish forces died .\nHowever , figures from Kurdish sources differed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 PKK fighters were killed as well as more than 30 Turkish soldiers .\nOn the third day of operations , thirteen Turkish nationals that were being held captive by the PKK in a location close to the village of Siyane were found dead by Turkish forces .\nAccording to both Kurdish and Turkish sources , some of those killed were civilians .\nAmong the civilians killed were Sedat Yabalak , a civilian police officer and father of three in charge of \u015eanl\u0131urfa Police Department ; and Aydin K\u00f6se , a resident of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , both men had been seized in Turkey by the PKK and held captive for several years in Kurdistan .\nAccording to the Turkish Ministry of Defence , Turkish forces discovered the dead bodies of the thirteen captives after entering a bunker , suggesting that the PKK had executed them .\nHowever , the PKK has contested these claims , asserting that the captives were instead killed by Turkish airstrikes during the initial bombardment of Gara Mountain .\nAccording to a PKK statement , the \u201c camp where prisoners of war belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been attacked in Gare .\nThe camp was intensively bombed from the air at five o \u2019 clock [ not clear if am or pm ] on February 10th\u2026 .\nAfter this strike , the occupying Turkish army retreated a bit .\nAlthough it knew that there were prisoners there , the camp was again intensively bombed by fighter jets .\nThe bombardment , which lasted for three days , and the fierce battles inside and outside the camp resulted in the death of some of the MIT members , soldiers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prisoners caused outrage across Turkey , with the Presidency \u2019 s media director , Fahrettin Altun emphasising Turkey \u2019 s intent to \u201c chase down every last terrorist hiding in their caves and safe houses \u201d and exact \u201c painful \u201d revenge and \u201c swift \u201d justice .\nThere were fears that Turkey could use the captives \u2019 deaths as a pretext to expand operations against Kurdish militant groups in northern Iraq , causing more peril for civilians .\n\u201c I expect the Turkish government to use the deaths to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraqi Kurdistan .\nTurkey may also attack Sinjar but this may have far more ramifications as pro-Iran militias are widely present in Sinjar and are allied with PKK-backed Yazidi groups \u201d , explained Hawez .\nThese expectations may soon be realised , given the increasingly hawkish rhetoric adopted by Ankara following Operation Claw Eagle 2 .\nSpeaking at a party rally on February 15th , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reaffirmed his desire to expand

Libyan lawyer and founder of the Jusoor Libya think tank , said the 2011 war has had two long-lasting effects that have deeply impacted Libyan society .\n\u201c The first is the impact on the social fabric that emerged from armed conflicts between cities , \u201d she told Airwars .\nDuring the war some neighbouring towns found themselves on either side of the conflict , with one broadly loyal to Gaddafi \u2019 s forces and the other supporting the rebellion .\n\u201c The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict on the mental wellbeing of civilians , including PTSD , stress and depression , \u201d Bugaighis added .\nThe majority of civilian harm identified in the events reviewed by Airwars was reportedly caused by forces of the Gaddafi regime \u2013 with between 869 and 1,999 likely deaths and as many as 1,100 injuries identified from 105 assessed actions .\nOverall , as many as 2,300 civilian deaths were locally alleged from these same Gaddafi actions .\nMany more small-scale killings have

\u201d said Bugaighis , who lived in Tripoli at the time .\n\u201c Growing up in Libya we were raised to fear the regime , so at first , I thought nothing would take down the regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more serious when the state of emergency was declared in Tripoli and foreigners were evacuated.\n\u201d Many Gaddafi forces incidents had previously gone unreported to an international audience , given the tendency of international media to focus only on larger scale events .\nOn June 29th for example , a review of local sources found that a 13-year old boy named Moftah Muhammad Jalwal was killed and six more civilians injured by Gaddafi forces shelling on the Doufan neighbourhood of Misurata .\nGruesome videos showed bloodstains at the site and injured children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on from NATO \u2019 s intervention , neither it nor any individual member has ever publicly admitted to a single civilian death .\nLibyans themselves tell a very different story .\nAirwars reviewed claims of thousands of airstrikes reportedly conducted by NATO and its allies during Libya 2011 , which between them resulted in 223 to 403 likely civilian deaths and 215 to 357 injuries in 84 events of concern , according to our assessment .\nNATO itself declared having conducted 7,600 strikes .\nOverall , Airwars identified as many as 800 civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though those higher claims appear to have been significantly exaggerated by pro-Gaddafi sources at the time .\nUnited Nations investigators after the war accused both Gaddafi and rebel forces of indiscriminate killings , but concluded that NATO had conducted a \u201c highly precise campaign with a demonstrable determination to avoid civilian casualties.\n\u201d They noted that the international alliance had used precision-guided munitions and carried out extensive pre-strike assessments to try and avoid killing civilians .\nFrederic Wehrey , Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment , said NATO planners were supported by Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had contributed to the accuracy of bombing and helped avoid civilian harm .\nBoth rebels and NATO were \u201c very active in liaison , coordinating various operation centres even though NATO commandos made clear they were not acting as the rebels \u2019 air force , \u201d he says .\nBut while NATO itself insisted it was purely focused on protecting civilians , key members of the alliance were accused of supporting regime change .\nAn Airwars investigation has found that a Norwegian effort to negotiate Gaddafi \u2019 s stepping down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the UK .\nAs the former Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Store now notes , \u201c Had there been in the international community a willingness to pursue this track with some authority and dedication , I believe there could have been an opening to achieve a less dramatic outcome and avoid the collapse of the Libyan state.\n\u201d Even though the number of reported civilian casualties from NATO actions is far lower when compared to Gaddafi forces , Airwars \u2019 findings indicate that likely fatalities were still significantly higher than the estimated 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , in its review of 20 events of concern .\nBy contrast and based on local reporting from the time across Libya , as well as major investigations by Human Rights Watch , Amnesty International and the New York Times , Airwars has identified at least 223 likely civilian deaths .\nThose seeking clarity about individual incidents remain sadly disappointed .\nInquiries to NATO about civilian harm from its actions in Libya are routinely referred to member states , which in turn then refer back to NATO .\nAll recent Freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member states about their potential role in civilian harm during 2011 have been denied .\nOnly on one known occasion , on June 19th 2011 , did NATO acknowledge that a malfunction of a munition in an attack on Tripoli \u2019 s Souk al Joumaa neighbourhood had potentially resulted in civilian casualties .\nMohammed Al Gharari , who lost five family members in the strike , told Airwars he had the following questions for NATO : \u201c You struck people and admitted that it was by mistake .\nWhy did you never care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity and you believe in human rights , you would have at least cared.\n\u201d \u201c Even after ten years , no phone call or even any official has contacted us.\n\u201d Aftermath of the incident in Souq Al Joumaa on June 19th , 2011 Little reporting on civilian harm from rebels Among the three parties to Libya \u2019 s 2011 war , the lowest documented number of civilian casualties was reported from rebel actions \u2013 with 57 incidents of concern reviewed by Airwars containing allegations of between 50 and 113 likely deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm from rebel actions can be explained by the lack of an air force and access to heavy weapons , particularly early on .\nIt may also reflect a lack of media interest at the time .\nThe largest known loss of civilian life from rebel actions was reported on August 10th in the remote southern city of Tawergha , when between 24 and 74 inhabitants , including whole families and an imam of the town , were claimed killed by artillery fire .\nTawergha was considered loyal to Gaddafi , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rebels .\nThe majority of residents have still not been able to return a decade on .\n\u201c 130 men from Tawergha are missing ever since , and no one knows anything about them .\nThey were taken by the rebels .\nMy brother is one of them , \u201d Gabriel Farag , who also had to flee Tawergha , told Airwars .\n\u201c These 130 men were arrested just for the mere fact that they are from Tawergha.\n\u201d \u201c The war has impacted Libyan society in many ways , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society is a tribal society , and the war has broken the connections between tribes across the country , \u201d says Mustafa Al Fetouri , a Libyan journalist who covered the civil war back in 2011 .\nWhat followed after the 2011 defeat of Gaddafi was a decade of chaos and on-and-off civil war that turned Libya into a failed state .\nMany hopes were betrayed and opportunities missed in a country that had once been described as Africa \u2019 s most developed .\n\u201c The notion of justice was completely absent after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Instead of avoiding a repetition of the injustice that occurred in the past , such as the Abu Salim prison incident or the killing of students , all we saw was the repetition of these mistakes over and over again.\n\u201d Airwars found that some victims had been paid compensation by one of Libya \u2019 s post-revolution governments , but only for damage done to property .\nEfforts to create proper mechanisms for restitution were abandoned when the country slipped into civil war again in 2014 .\n\u201c Justice was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , all those in power have failed to do so , and it may be in a systematic way to entrench chaos and hate , \u201d explained Bughaigis .\nFormer US President Barack Obama once described the failure to plan for what came after NATO \u2019 s intervention in Libya as a \u201c shit show \u201d , and as his biggest foreign policy mistake .\n\u201c We averted large-scale civilian casualties , we prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict .\nAnd despite all that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told The Atlantic in 2016 .\nHowever , better times could now be ahead for Libyans , with the country recently selecting a unified transitional government which has committed to working on a reconciliation process for those affected by the civil wars .\nThose in the international community who have become embroiled in Libya \u2019 s violence since 2011 could now too \u2013 it might be hoped \u2013 finally acknowledge the civilian harm they themselves have caused .", "author": "Oliver Imhof", "url":

civilians in twelve likely US actions in Yemen during the Trump presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not responded .\nThe 124-page report from Mwatana , \u2018 Death Falling From The Sky \u2019 , was eventually published in late March without input from CENTCOM .\nIt presents a grim view of an intensive campaign by the US military under President Trump to target alleged Al Qaeda fighters in Yemen , part of a long-running counterterrorism effort begun by Barack Obama in 2009 .\nIn total according to Airwars monitoring , a record 327 US airstrikes and ground actions in Yemen were alleged during the Trump

.\nVictims were only identified , for example , after being explicitly named by witnesses and surviving family members .\nIn any case where the combatant status of a casualty was less than clear , they were excluded from the potential civilian tally .\nA disastrous US raid on the village of Yakla in late January 2017 killed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed .\nOthers have placed the toll far higher .\nIn its own estimate , Mwatana conservatively says that at least 15 civilians died that day .\n\u201c For the Yakla event , we respect that others have reached different findings , \u201d says Kristine Beckerle , legal director , accountability and redress at Mwatana .\n\u201c We never say \u2018 these are all the people killed that day \u2019 .\nWhat we can say is that we are confident in those victims that we name.\n\u201d That conservative approach makes the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c This report raises serious concerns about the extent to which the United States is complying with international law in its use of lethal force in Yemen , \u201d Mwatana asserts .\n\u201c It finds that the United States is failing to investigate credible allegations of violations , to hold individuals responsible for violations to account , and to provide prompt and adequate reparations.\n\u201d US silence on deaths of women Each of the twelve events detailed in the Mwatana investigation provides such compelling evidence of civilian harm that CENTCOM \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks after the incident itself , a public US Central Command statement had for example confirmed that a US strike had taken place in the Yemeni province of Bayda on December 15th 2017 , which it indicated had resulted in the death of Miqdad al-Sana \u2019 ani , described in the press release as an \u201c external operations facilitator \u201d for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) .\nCENTCOM made no mention of civilian harm .\nThe only locally reported action in Bayda that December day was again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local sources agreed that a likely US drone strike had killed Hajera Ahmed Saleh Al Taisi , 33 years old and pregnant , and her 63-year old aunt , Dhabia Ahmad Al Taisi .\nAccording to Mwatana , \u201c On the day of the strike , Dhabia was visiting Hajera \u2019 s home , about 90 meters from Dhabia \u2019 s own small house .\nAt about 6pm , as Dhabia was leaving the house , the strike occurred .\nThe strike hit right next to the entrance of the house , killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door .\nHajera was in her kitchen .\nShe was hit by shrapnel in the neck , which ripped through her back .\nThe surrounding homes suffered varying degrees of damage from the strike.\n\u201d According to one report , a man was also killed in the attack who may have been the AQAP suspect al-Sana \u2019 ani .\nYet there is no dispute locally that two women died that day .\nAs Hajera \u2019 s husband told Mwatana , \u2018 My wife was expecting a child ; the shrapnel killed her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their movements are almost paralyzed by fear.\n\u201d Kristine Beckerle says this was one of the events she had expected CENTCOM to concede : \u201c Maybe , I thought , they would admit the case of these two women \u2013 one pregnant , killed in their house .\nThere is no advantage I can see to their not engaging on this case .\nYet we have had no response until now.\n\u201d US Central Command was first provided full details of the Mwatana investigation on November 4th 2020 , says accountability officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than five months to respond .\nWe even delayed publication several times to give them the opportunity to respond .\nThat CENTCOM didn \u2019 t even take the time to write a proper response to express their position on these findings is very disrespectful to victims.\n\u201d This echoes other recent experiences with the US \u2019 s largest combatant command .\nAs this organisation recently noted in its own recent Yemen study Eroding Transparency , \u201c Despite Airwars providing CENTCOM with its complete civilian harm findings on Yemen during the Trump presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s publication , officials unfortunately failed to provide any event responses.\n\u201d CENTCOM also had to issue an apology in late 2020 as a result of what it described as an \u201c administrative error \u201d , after conceding it had forgotten its own earlier public admission of the killing of up to 12 civilians during the raid on Yakla village in early 2017 .\nAccountability for civilian harm at CENTCOM appears to be in decline

The Pentagon \u2019 s annual report to Congress on civilian deaths and injuries resulting from US military actions around the world has declared more than 100 recent casualties .\nResearchers and human rights groups , including Airwars , Amnesty International and UN monitors in Afghanistan , place the actual toll significantly higher .\nFor 2020 alone , the Department of Defence said that its

minimum public estimate of civilian deaths caused by US forces during 2020 across five conflict nations was 102 fatalities \u2013 almost five times higher than DoD admits .\nCasualties from US actions in Afghanistan in particular appear to have been officially undercounted .\nWhile the Pentagon reports only 20 deaths and 5 injuries from its own actions last year , UNAMA \u2013 the respected UN agency in Afghanistan \u2013 says that international forces killed at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUnited States personnel made up the great majority of those foreign forces .\nFor Somalia , DoD declares only one civilian death from US actions last year \u2013 while Airwars and others suggest a minimum civilian toll of seven killed .\nAnd for Iraq and Syria , while US forces declare only one death , local reporting indicates at least six civilians killed by US actions .\nOnly for Yemen is there agreement , with monitoring organisations and the DoD both indicating that there were no likely

in 2020 , \u2019 has been a requirement of US law since 2018 .\nThe latest report captures the very significant fall in tempo of US military actions during the latter years of Donald Trump \u2019 s presidency .\nAccording to Airwars estimates , there were around 1,000 US strikes across four conflict countries during 2020 \u2013 down from approximately 3,500 strikes the previous year and a peak of 13,000 such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths fell from 132 to 23 from 2019 to 2020 .\nThe majority of civilian deaths declared by the Pentagon during 2020 were in Afghanistan \u2013 despite a major ceasefire between US forces and the Taliban for much of the year .\nAccording to the new DoD report , 20 civilians were killed and five injured in seven US actions , primarily airstrikes .\nThe seven civilian casualty events conceded in Afghanistan by the Pentagon for 2020 However the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan ( UNAMA ) which has been recording extensive data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fighting since 2009 , placed the toll far higher .\nAccording to its own annual report for 2020 published earlier this year , \u201c UNAMA attributed 120 civilian casualties ( 89 killed and 31 injured ) to international military forces \u201d .\nWhile these casualties represented just one per cent of the overall reported civilian toll in Afghanistan for the year \u2013 with most civilians killed by the Taliban and Afghan forces \u2013 of concern was DoD \u2019 s major undercounting of its own impact on civilians \u2013 with UNAMA logging four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from US actions than those officially conceded by the Pentagon .\nReported civilian casualties from US actions against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria have remained low since the terror group \u2019 s defeat as a territorial entity in mid

security guard Karrar Sabbar was killed in that US attack .\nHowever the additional reported deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not acknowledged by the US .\nIn Syria , Airwars estimates three to six likely civilian deaths from US actions during 2020 , mainly during counterterrorism raids against ISIS remnants .\nNone of these were conceded either .\nIn Somalia , between 7 and 13 civilians were likely killed by US actions during the year , according to Airwars monitoring of local communities .\nThe US military itself concedes five injuries and one death , in two events in early 2020 near Jilib .\nOnly for Yemen did human rights organisations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting no likely civilian deaths from US actions during the year .\nUS forces in Somalia killed one civilian and injured five others during 2020 , according to official estimates Despite continuing disparities between public and military estimates of civilian harm , the Pentagon \u2019 s annual report to Congress still represents a significant transparency breakthrough .\nClose ally France , for example , has refused to declare a single civilian fatality from almost seven years of air and artillery strikes in Iraq and Syria \u2013 and recently lashed out at the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding party in Mali .\nLater this year the Pentagon will also issue a major overhaul of its civilian casualty mitigation policies , which it has been reviewing in consultation with human rights organisations for several years .\nOn May 25th , new Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Dr Colin Kahl confirmed in writing to NGOs that the new policy \u2013 known as a Department of Defense Instruction , or DoD-I \u2013 would be published by the Biden administration .\n\u201c We welcome the Pentagon \u2019 s publication to

actions .\nA recent report by Agence France Presse interviewed victims of the single worst disaster , when a U.S. strike killed more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mosul in March 2017 , and found they were still

military , has been a legal requirement since 2018 .\nIn the latest report , the Pentagon admitted to killing 23 civilians worldwide during 2020 , though monitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shown the real figure is likely many times higher .\nThe report also incorrectly acknowledged responsibility for 50 historical civilian deaths in 11 airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria between January 2017 and February 2018 .\nThe Pentagon at first said the incidents had \u201c inadvertently \u201d not been included in reports in previous years , but most were in fact carried out by allied nations .\nWhile the campaign against ISIS was fought by a coalition of mostly Western nations , the report explicitly stated that it \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of U.S.-operated weapons , \u201d meaning no strikes conducted by allied aircraft should have been included .\nThe Intercept and Airwars cross-checked these incidents against public records and found that of the 11 , nine were not carried out

facts.\n\u2019 In the context of an airstrike from thousands of feet and with no Coalition civilian casualty investigation forces on the ground , such overwhelming proof is near impossible to come by .\nTo date , the UK has accepted just one civilian death in Iraq and Syria , despite 8,000 declared flight sorties over seven years .\nGavin Crowden , Executive Director of Every Casualty Counts , said that when it came to civilian harm , the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) was pretending the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u201c The Pentagon has shattered the MoD \u2019 s already implausible claim that British forces have caused only one civilian death across Iraq and Syria .\nThis is statistically almost impossible.\n\u201d \u201c The [ Chilcot ] Report of the Iraq Inquiry made clear that the MoD had failed to account for civilian casualties following the invasion in 2003 .\nAlmost twenty years on , the MoD is still failing to take even basic steps to identify and record harm caused to civilians.\n\u201d The other three incidents the Pentagon insists were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either Belgian or French strikes .\nOn February 27th 2017 a Coalition strike on an ISIS vehicle near the Iraqi-Syrian border killed at least one civilian and injured another .\nLocal sources said the death toll could have been as high as three .\nThe Coalition accepted causing the harm , and a senior Belgian government official unofficially informed Airwars that the strike was Belgian , though the government has never publicly confirmed this .\nOn March 21st 2017 a civilian was killed in a Coalition strike in the Iraqi city of Mosul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed Airwars that the strike was Belgian , though the government has never publicly confirmed this .\nThe final incident , which took place on February 8th 2018 , killed one civilian near Al-Bahrah village in Syria .\nAirwars identified it as a likely French strike , though Paris has always publicly refused to comment .\nTo date , neither France nor Belgium has publicly accepted killing any civilians in years of bombing Iraq and Syria .\nMarc Garlasco , a military advisor for PAX and a former US senior Department of Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would increase pressure on European militaries to stop hiding behind the anonymity of the Coalition .\nIn 2015 a devastating strike in the town of Hawijah in Iraq led to the deaths of more than 70 civilians .\nThe Coalition eventually accepted responsibility , but no member state did .\nIt was only in 2019 , after investigative reporting , that the Dutch government finally admitted responsibility .\n\u201c It is time for European MoDs to stop hiding behind American statistics and take responsibility for the harm they cause and provide appropriate amends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central issue for civilians is the problem coalition warfare causes for strike attribution , and therefore amends .\nToo often we have seen war victims unable to make claims or even get answers for why they were targeted because they just don \u2019 t know who dropped the bombs .\nIt is unreasonable to put the onus of proof on the victim.\n\u201d He pointed out that in the wake of the Hawijah massacre

Count \u2019 s Gavin Crowden said the US civilian casualty monitoring process , though far from perfect , was a clear example for other countries to follow .\nSo far the US has admitted killing more than 1,300 civilians in the war against ISIS .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire smart missiles straight into the bedroom of a specific target , they should surely be able to compile basic data about where and when they have conducted operations that may have harmed civilians.\n\u201d \u201c The US has shown that this is both logistically , militarily and politically possible .\nTherefore , we have to conclude that the obstacle among European militaries is simply a lack of will.\n\u201d Airwars asked the British , French and Belgian militaries for comment on the Pentagon \u2019 s report .\nNone said they

urgently improve its approach to the protection of civilians and civilian harm monitoring , reports Airwars ' advocacy team .\nOver the last decade , warfare has undergone significant changes .\nCountries such as the UK and US have increasingly done their best to avoid large-scale ground deployments of their own troops , focusing instead on supporting local forces , for instance by providing air power .\nThrough the monitoring of nearly 60,000 locally alleged civilian deaths caused by belligerents across multiple conflicts , Airwars has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of engagement can pose in nations like Iraq and Syria , with heavy uses of explosive weapons in urban environments often leading to very significant civilian casualties and major destruction of civilian infrastructure .\nDespite acknowledging the potential risks from recent actions , which saw \u201c the most significant urban combat to take place since World War II \u201d , the UK has failed to improve its approach to the Protection of Civilians ( POC ) .\nIn fact , the UK remains hesitant to openly acknowledge harm from its own actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by introducing public transparency and accountability for identification , review and admissions of casualties is vital to reduce present and future civilian casualties .\nThis article will assess current UK government action with regard to developing and updating its protection of civilian policies .\nOne of the most comprehensive reviews of UK military action in recent times , the 2016 Chilcot report , repeatedly emphasised that the MoD has failed to accurately estimate possible civilian harm that would arise from the 2003-2011 war in Iraq .\nIn fact , the report states the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only \u2019 cost civilian lives in the \u201c low hundreds \u201d .\nIn reality , Iraq Body Count estimated that more than 114,000 civilians died as a result of violence in Iraq between 2003 and 2011 .\nThe Chilcot report called for the UK to improve how it reaches pre-conflict estimates of civilian harm , declaring that a \u2018 government has a responsibility to make every reasonable effort to identify and understand the likely and actual effects of its military actions on civilians.\n\u2019 It also said governments should make \u2018 greater efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of civilian casualties \u2019 and to understand the broader impact of these actions .\nIn response , MoD officials pledged to improve the protection of civilians in the future .\nNevertheless , the key challenges to effective POC identified in the Chilcot report persist to this day , including a lack of accountability ; a lack of understanding of the impact of British airstrikes on the ground ; and a false belief that the use of \u2018 smart \u2019 guided munitions might automatically lead to fewer casualties .\nThis is highlighted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has evidence of only a single civilian casualty from its ongoing seven-year campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria .\nThis does not mean , as the MoD has repeatedly emphasised , that they believe their actions have only caused a single civilian death , but only that they claim to have the evidence of one casualty .\nHowever the US-led Coalition has itself concluded that fifteen additional civilians were killed in at least three actions in Iraq and Syria which are known to have been British airstrikes .\nAirwars , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and news outlets , have demonstrated that their own mechanisms to capture civilian harm reports are often far more accurate than those of militaries .\nFor the past two years for example , the majority of officially declared civilian harm reports by the US-led Coalition originated with Airwars , rather than internal military reports .\nThe UK government must therefore reflect on why it has consistently failed to incorporate adequate civilian casualty monitoring mechanisms into all recent operations .\nAs Airwars \u2019 \u2018 Europe \u2019 s Shame \u2019 investigation highlights , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to understand and report on the harm that comes from British actions than the UK itself .\nThis was reaffirmed by the recent publication of a Pentagon report to Congress in which they detailed civilian casualties known to have been caused by allies , including Britain .\nThis is not to say that there has been no progress at the MoD since the findings of the Chilcot report .\nWhen it comes to responding to requests for information regarding specific alleged civilian harm events during the war against ISIS , the MoD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least compared to allies .\nYet a number of key changes are required within the Ministry of Defence to ensure that the UK consistently and effectively protects those on the ground when it goes to war , and is transparent when things do go wrong .\nTo improve the UK Defence Ministry \u2019 s approach to POC , the following key steps must be taken .\nFirstly , the UK must learn from its allies and independent organisations by establishing a permanent civilian harm tracking cell within the Ministry with strong local understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site visits and witness interviews for assessments where possible .\nThe UK must also review the exceptionally high bar it sets for determining civilian harm .\nSenior British defence officials have confirmed to both the BBC and to Airwars that the UK presently requires what it calls \u2018 hard facts \u2019 when assessing civilian harm claims \u2013 an apparently higher standard even than the \u2018 beyond reasonable doubt \u2019 used by UK courts .\nCivilian casualty assessors within the US military instead use a \u2018 balance of probabilities \u2019 approach , Airwars understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports of civilian harm in their own investigations .\nTransparency must then follow .\nInformation about incidents that may have harmed civilians should be publicly disclosed , investigated and fed into internal lessons mechanisms to inform broader approaches to civilian harm mitigation .\nAs outlined by Mike Spagat from Every Casualty Counts : \u201c Transparency about operations can help build positive relations with the public , improve the quality of field data and , ultimately , improve military performance.\n\u201d By better understanding the negative impact of its military actions on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the UK will become more accountable both to its own citizens and to those who live where the UK \u2019 s armed forces or close partners engage overseas .\nThis would also place the UK in line with allies like the US , which have made a conscious effort to acknowledge at least some instances of civilian harm , as seen for example in Airwars \u2019 investigation of \u201c The Credibles \u201d .\nAs a key step towards this , we urge the British government to follow many allies , primarily European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of explosive weapons in populated areas ( EWIPA ) in the planning and conduct of operations .\nAs Rachel Hobley from Humanity and Inclusion emphasises : \u201c When explosive weapons with wide area effects are used in populated areas , 90 percent of those killed or injured are civilians .\nThis compares to just 25 percent in non-urban areas .\n\u201c These statistics , which have remained the same for the last 10 years , show the systematic humanitarian harm that arises from these practices .\nNot only are people killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also destroyed , health clinics decimated , and key services like water and electricity wiped out.\n\u201d The MoD is only one actor among many within the UK government which is responsible for protecting civilians on the ground .\nThe Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office ( FCDO ) is also vital , as it leads on the UK \u2019 s official Approach to the Protection of Civilians .\nIt is particularly concerning that commitments made in the UK \u2019 s 2020 Approach to the Protection of Civilians policy , to \u201c investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have caused civilian harm \u201d , have yet to lead to any tangible changes in the UK \u2019 s approach .\nAt the same time , there is a lack of guidance on how the UK will respond when harm does occur .\nThis reflects a broader trend in which cornerstone policies for the UK \u2019 s engagements abroad too often fail adequately to address the importance of protecting civilians .\nFor example , while the government \u2019 s recent Integrated Review of Security , Defence , Development and Foreign Policy , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad in its scope \u2013 covering everything from cyber warfare to terrorism \u2013 it fails to mention the protection of civilians once .\nThis reveals a significant lack of prioritisation of POC , despite such protections being identified time and time again as a key to obtaining strategic goals in wars .\nIn collaboration with partner civil society organisations , Airwars has held positive discussions with Lord Ahmad , Minister of State for the Commonwealth , in attempts to better understand how the FCDO intends to improve its approach .\nAt the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab , have promised to create a \u2018 conflict centre \u2019 .\nYet , despite concerted efforts to gain more information , we are left with a long list of questions on what this will focus on ; to what degree it will allow for engagement with civil society actors ; and how much it will prioritise the protection of civilians .\nFinally , in addition to changes that both the MoD and FCDO must implement to be accountable and protect civilians , we urge the Government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other as they are jointly responsible for delivering protections on the ground .\nAs it stands , the two departments often do not even use the same terminology , with the MoD focusing on \u2018 Human Security \u2019 and the FCDO pursuing \u2018 Protection of Civilians \u2019 .\nWhile the two agendas are implicitly connected , it remains unclear why the departments have chosen different approaches , and how they will work together to ensure delivery .\nMaking the UK \u2019 s approach to the protection of civilians more accountable and transparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or simple process .\nYet it is a vital one ; not only for the sake of the civilians who find themselves caught in conflict , but also to ensure that UK actions abroad contribute to stability .", "author": "Dmytro Chupryna", "url":

refrain in US media reporting of the cost of two decades of the so-called \u2018 War on Terror.\n\u2019 The trope goes something like this : \u201c more than 7,000 US service people have died in wars since 9/11 , \u201d an article or news report will say .\nIn the next line it will usually , though not always , try to reflect the civilian toll \u2013 but almost exclusively in generalities .\nTens , or even hundreds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist atrocities , and the subsequent launch of the War on Terror , Airwars has been seeking the answer to one important question \u2013 how many civilians have US strikes likely killed in the \u2018 Forever Wars \u2019 ?\nWe found that the US has declared at least 91,340 strikes across seven major conflict zones .\nOur research has concluded that at least 22,679 , and potentially as many as 48,308 civilians , have been likely killed by US strikes .\nThe gap between these two figures reflects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm in war .\nBelligerents rarely track the effects of their own actions \u2013 and even then do so poorly .\nIt is left to local communities , civil society and international agencies to count the costs .\nMultiple sources can however suggest different numbers of fatalities , meaning that monitoring organisations like Airwars will record both minimum and maximum estimates .\nOur key findings of civilian harm from US actions since 9/11 can be seen in this video and the full dataset is available here .\nThis accompanying article explains the conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more detail , before outlining our methodology and data sources .\nWhat are the \u2018 Forever Wars \u2019 ?\nIn the days after the terrorist atrocities of September 11 , 2001 , in which 2,977 people were killed by Al Qaeda in New York , Pennsylvania and Virginia , US President George W. Bush announced the start of a new type of war , one without defined borders , boundaries , or timescales .\n\u201c Our war on terror begins with Al Qaeda , but it does not end there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found , stopped and defeated.\n\u201d \u201c Americans should not expect one battle , but a lengthy campaign unlike any other we have ever seen .\nIt may include dramatic strikes visible on TV and covert operations secret even in success.\n\u201d \u201c Every nation in every region now has a decision to make : either you are with us or you are with the terrorists , \u201d he concluded .\nSo it came to pass .\nThe War on Terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By 2017 for example , the US Department of Defense said it had around 8,000 \u201c special operators \u201d in 80 countries across the globe .\nDubbed the \u2018 Forever Wars , \u2019 this conflict has not had clear territorial boundaries , though we have included in our dataset the seven most intensive US military campaigns .\nThe types of conflict vary significantly but broadly fall into three categories : \u2022 Full invasions and occupations of countries \u2013 Afghanistan 2001-2021 , and Iraq 2003-2009 .\n\u2022 Major bombing campaigns against the Islamic State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014-2021 , and Libya 2016 .\n\u2022 More targeted US drone and airstrike campaigns against militant and terror groups \u2013 Somalia 2007-2021 , Yemen 2002-2021 , Pakistan 2004-2018 , and Libya 2014-2019 .\nBased on official US military data , we have concluded that the US has carried out a minimum of 91,340 airstrikes throughout the 20 years of the War on Terror .\nParticular peaks were seen during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , when the US declared 18,695 strike sorties .\nThe campaign against the so-called Islamic State also saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9,000 strikes a year from 2015-2017 .\nWe then gathered together every reliable estimate of civilian harm as a result of US strikes .\nWherever possible we sought to measure civilian harm just from US airstrikes but in some cases , such as the first years of the Iraq invasion , it was impossible to disaggregate airstrikes from artillery fire and other heavy munitions , which were therefore included .\nLikewise in some US-led Coalitions it was impossible to determine whether each individual strike was American , though US airpower has dominated all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review of credible sources , we found at least 22,679 civilians were likely directly killed by US strikes since 9/11 , with that number potentially as high as 48,308 .\nThe deadliest year came in 2003 , when a minimum of 5,529 civilians were reported to have been killed by US actions according to the monitoring organisation Iraq Body Count , almost all during the invasion of Iraq that year .\nThe next deadliest year was 2017 , when at least 4,931 civilians were likely killed , the vast majority in alleged Coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we include maximum estimates of civilian harm then 2017 was in fact the worst year for civilian casualties , with up to 19,623 killed .\nAlmost all of the reported civilian deaths from US wars since 9/11 ( 97 percent ) occurred in the two occupations ( Iraq 2003-20119 , and Afghanistan 2001-2021 ) ; as well as in the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( 2014-2021 ) .\nIn 2011 , at the peak of its 20-year occupation , the US had more than 100,000 troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end last month when the final US troops left after a chaotic withdrawal .\nDuring the Iraq occupation , troops numbers peaked at 166,000 in 2007 , though forces withdrew by 2011 .\nJust three years later and following the rise of so-called Islamic State , the US and its international partners began an aerial bombing campaign against ISIS in support of allies on the ground .\nCampaigns to force ISIS from the Iraqi city of Mosul and the Syrian city of Raqqa in 2016-2017 saw some of the most intense urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Raqqa alone , Coalition strikes reportedly killed at least 1,600 civilians .\nWhile the Islamists lost their last territorial stronghold in April 2019 , the war continues at a low intensity .\nAs part of our research , we also sought official US military estimates for the numbers of civilians killed by its own actions since 9/11 .\nNeither CENTCOM nor the Department of Defense have published such findings .\nIn the Iraq and Syria campaign against ISIS , the US-led Coalition has accepted killing 1,417 civilians \u2013 far lower than Airwars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian deaths for that war .\nAdditionally , in 2016 the US admitted killing between 64 and 116 civilians in Libya , Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen in counter terrorism operations in the years between 2009 and 2015 .\nBut it provided no further details , dates or specifics \u2013 making assessment of those claims near impossible .\nMore publicly , the United States has admitted to killing two civilians in Pakistan ; thirteen in Yemen ; and five in Somalia in recent years .\nAt least 394 and as many as 570 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US actions in those countries , according to monitoring organisation New America .\nAirwars approached CENTCOM , the part of the US military responsible for most of these conflicts , directly for this project .\nIt said data on officially recognised civilian harm was not readily available .\n\u201c The information you request is not immediately on hand in our office as it spans between multiple operations/campaigns within a span of between 18 and 20 years , \u201d CENTCOM said in an email , requesting instead that we file a Freedom of Information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to get a response , with no guarantee of the information being released .\nIt \u2019 s important to note that Airwars has examined only direct harm from US strikes since 9/11 \u2013 with many of our sources providing conservative casualty estimates .\nWe are therefore looking at a fraction of the overall civilian harm in these countries .\nMore than 300,000 civilians have been killed by all parties to these conflicts since 2001 , according to the well respected Brown University Cost of War programme .\nEven so , we believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment available of minimum civilian harm by direct US strikes and actions in the 20 years of the War on Terror .\nParts or all of the data presented here were peer reviewed by multiple experts in the field , and our full dataset has also been published , to enable scrutiny .\nThat said , we acknowledge that civilian harm monitoring mechanisms have varied and evolved extensively over the past 20 years , and are rarely consistent across organisations and campaigns .\nAirwars itself was formed in 2014 , and has collated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s conflicts since then , using our all-source monitoring in local languages to gather allegations of civilian harm .\nHowever , for much of the data in the years before 2014 and for the entirety of the Afghanistan campaign \u2013 which Airwars does not monitor \u2013 we are reliant upon other organisations .\nThis section will explain where the data was gathered from .\nIn Afghanistan the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan ( UNAMA ) has released civilian harm data since 2006 .\nThis includes likely civilian harm from airstrikes carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Terror was launched by the US , some allies initially joined \u2013 including European nations that sent significant contingents to Afghanistan .\nIt was not possible to definitively conclude if all of these strikes were conducted by the US as opposed to allied nations , although the US provided the overwhelming majority of airpower throughout the war .\nIn the early years of the conflict , for the period 2001-05 before UNAMA was fully operational , we have relied upon an investigative dataset compiled by The Nation , which though well researched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The US and UK invaded Iraq in 2003 to overthrow President Saddam Hussein , and then maintained an occupation with the support of other nations until withdrawing all forces in 2011 .\nIn the vacuum after Hussein was unseated , multiple militant groups , including Al Qaeda in Iraq , a predecessor of the Islamic State , thrived .\nHundreds of thousands of Iraqis were killed in ensuing conflict-related violence .\nThe NGO Iraq Body Count has been collating tolls of civilian harm since the 2003 invasion .\nIt kindly agreed to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilian harm caused by US actions between 2003 and 2013 .\nAccording to IBC , in many cases such as the initial invasion , and the assaults on the city of Fallujah in 2004 , it was near impossible to disaggregate civilian harm caused by airstrikes with artillery and other munitions .\nAs such , the data from Iraq Body Count presented here relates to deaths caused by airstrikes and explosive weapons .\nIncidents where only small arms fire was involved have been excluded .\nAs with Afghanistan , it is impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carried out by the US or partner nations , though the US provided the overwhelming majority of airpower throughout the war .\nIn the years after the Arab Spring rippled through the Middle East and North Africa in 2011 , the Islamic State militant group seized a swathe of territory spanning northern Iraq and Syria which was roughly the size of the United Kingdom .\nFrom 2014 onwards , the US led an international coalition in a bombing campaign against the group , eventually forcing it to cede its last area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 2019 .\nAirwars has monitored civilian harm related to the ongoing seven-year war against the Islamic State since the beginning of the campaign , using a standardised methodology and approach for all our civilian harm monitoring projects .\nOur researchers conduct daily monitoring of local Arabic-language media and social media in Iraq and Syria , documenting and archiving all claims of civilian harm including those claims reported by the local communities themselves .\nEach event has a unique assessment online , where an archived version of all sources used is also available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 constantly updated as new information is found .\nAl Qaeda had a limited presence in Libya following the defeat of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 , and was the target of a small number of US strikes .\nThen from 2014 , an Islamic State affiliate emerged in the country \u2013 seizing control of several cities and towns a year later .\nAirwars researchers have actively monitored all civilian harm caused by all parties in Libya for many years .\nBased on hyperlocal media monitoring , and reflecting the same methodology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have aggregated the number of alleged civilian deaths related to US strikes against both Al Qaeda and so-called Islamic State in Libya since 2012 .\nIn the years after 9/11 the United States launched an initially secret drone campaign targeting militant organisations in Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen .\nThese campaigns led to often significant allegations of civilian harm .\nIn Pakistan , the data was originally collected by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism , with those archives transferred to Airwars in 2019 .\nThere have been no reported US strikes since July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published a comprehensive review of all civilian harm allegations from both suspected and declared US strikes and actions since the conflict began in 2007 .\nIn Yemen , the data from 2002-2016 was originally collected by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism .\nAirwars has actively monitored the US counter terrorism campaign in Yemen since 2017 , and all associated allegations of civilian harm .\nIn every conflict , those organisations monitoring civilian harm have applied different methodologies .\nAirwars , TBIJ and Iraq Body Count are for example remote monitors \u2013 meaning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect any uncertainties in their findings \u2013 for example by using high and low casualty ranges , rather than definitive figures .\nUNAMA employs a different methodology for Afghanistan .\nBased until recently in Kabul , it deployed field researchers in each province to physically investigate where possible sites of alleged civilian harm , and to interview witnesses .\nWhile this approach can lead to more certainty about circumstances and casualty numbers in an individual event , it may also mean that some locally reported cases can be missed .\nUNAMA also does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one number of confirmed civilians killed per year .\nMore

the US military to respond quickly to the allegations it had killed civilians .\nSadly the vast majority of civilians killed by the US in Afghanistan never receive the same attention , or apologies .\nA recent Airwars investigation found that overall , at least 22,000 civilians have likely been killed by US airstrikes during the \u2018 war on terror \u2019 since 2001 .\nAt least 4,815 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that number could be far higher .\nOnly a fraction of these events have received official US recognition .\nMany families can wait months , or even years , for a reply .\nMost never hear back .\nAmnesty International , calling for a fuller investigation into the Kabul strike , pointed out that \u201c many similar strikes in Syria , Iraq , and Somalia have happened out of the spotlight , and the US continues to deny responsibility while devastated families suffer in silence.\n\u201d Here are just five examples of Afghan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family members to alleged US strikes in recent years .\nMany were originally investigated by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism \u2019 s Drone Warfare project , which ended in 2020 and whose archives are now curated by Airwars .\nIn the early hours of March 9th 2019 , Dr Nazargul Khan and his children were sleeping in their village in the Hesarak district , Nangarhar province \u2013 around 30 miles east of Kabul .\nSuddenly their home was ripped apart .\n\u201c The first bomb that was dropped was on my cousins who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Waheeda , 14 , Nazargul \u2019 s oldest child , told Al Jazeera .\n\u201c My father got up and went to their room but by the time they reached the room another bomb was dropped on my father , sisters , and mother.\n\u201d In total twelve members of the Khan family , including Nazargul and nine children , died that night in an alleged US strike .\nDespite the testimony of Sherif and Waheeda , the US has not accepted causing the civilian harm .\nInstead , it designated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation , leaving the survivors with no clear answers and no route to seek compensation or justice .\nOn November 24th 2018 , the village of Loy Manda , ten miles outside of Lashkar Gah in southwestern Afghanistan , found itself on the frontline as Afghan government forces \u2013 backed up by their American allies \u2013 battled the Taliban .\nAs a column of Afghan and US Special Operations forces moved into the area , the Ishaqzai family huddled in their home .\nIn an apparent attempt to hit Taliban fighters moving through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airstrike , witnesses told The Bureau of Investigative Journalism .\nA father and son were killed and 13 members of the extended family injured , 10 of them children .\nThe US military later admitted that four civilians were injured in a strike in Helmand on this day in their annual report on civilian casualties .\nThis is believed to be a significant undercount .\nOn the evening of September 22rd 2018 , the inhabitants of the village of Mullah Hafiz , in Wardak province , were alerted to the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the town as soldiers swept in for a raid on a Taliban prison .\nMasih Ur-Rahman Mubarez was in Iran for work but his wife and all their seven children , alongside four young cousins , were killed in an airstrike .\nHis youngest was just four years old .\n\u201c Our life was full of love , \u201d Masih told The Bureau of Investigative Journalism ( TBIJ ) .\nInitially the US repeatedly denied it had bombed Masih \u2019 s house , or even that any airstrike had taken place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times and researchers from TBIJ investigated further , the military admitted that it did conduct a strike in that location , saying it was \u201c possible , although unlikely , civilians died.\n\u201d On the 28th of September 2016 , 15 Afghans were killed in a single US drone strike in the province of Nangarhar , east of the capital of Kabul , according to the United Nations .\nThe US said it struck militants from the so-called Islamic State , describing it as a \u201c counter-terrorism \u201d strike .\nThe UN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents welcoming a tribal elder returning from religious pilgrimage to Mecca .\nThe UN did acknowledge reports that IS fighters were among the dead but said the majority were civilians including \u201c students and a teacher , as well as members of families considered to be pro-government.\n\u201d Haji Rais , the owner of the house hit , lost his son in the strike .\nThe day after the strike , the then-spokesman for the US military in Afghanistan , Brigadier General Charles , told The New York Times the allegations of civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to work with Afghan authorities to determine if there is cause for additional investigation , \u201d he said .\nIn the early hours of the morning on May 24th 2019 , an alleged US airstrike struck a building in Shib Koh district , Farah province , which runs along the border with Iran in western Afghanistan .\nAbdul Hamid and Abdul Rahim were colleagues and had decided to stay the night at the offices of the emergency aid NGO they worked for .\nAt approximately 1:20 am the building was leveled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abdul Rahim was 22 and had married just a month before his death .\nHe worked as a supervisor at the charity , which he had joined relatively recently .\nOne colleague said of him : \u201c He was such a softly spoken person .\nHe was a very good man with the best manners.\n\u201d The US military ultimately deemed the allegations of civilian harm \u201c possible \u201d , a phrasing neither accepting nor denying responsibility .\nCENTCOM , the part of the US military responsible for Afghanistan , had not replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Airwars seeking updates about its investigations into these five cases .\nIn the years before the final American soldier left Afghanistan last month , the US had relied increasingly on airpower .\nIn 2015 there were about 500 US strikes .\nBy 2019 that figure was more than 7,000 .\nThat year the United Nations documented the highest number of civilian fatalities from airstrikes since they began recording in 2009 , most of them by US aircraft .\nHowever , the US military officially accepted only a fifth of the civilian deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2019 .\nAllegations are frequently determined as either \u201c not credible \u201d or \u201c disproved \u201d .\nOften this is based on the military not having sufficient information to fully investigate .\n\u201c There has been a lot of hand wringing and convenient blaming of intelligence over the past weeks , \u201d says Mark Goodwin-Hudson , who in 2016 as a Lieutenant Colonel headed NATO \u2019 s Civilian Casualty Investigation Team in Afghanistan .\n\u201c The killing highlights how shallow and misleading the assumption is that war can be conducted successfully from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t matter how accurate a modern weapon system is if the intelligence that underpins the strike is flawed.\n\u201d \u201c In my experience civilian casualty investigations in Afghanistan were strongly weighted against finding sufficient evidence for an allegation to be recorded as credible , \u201d Goodwin-Hudson added .\n\u201c In some instances , investigators were denied access to mission critical intelligence , as it was deemed too sensitive to be read by anyone who was not already in the classified compartment that had planned , authorised and implemented the strike in question.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mechanisms of getting official recognition that their loved ones were innocent was complicated enough before the US withdrawal .\nFor many it may now be all but impossible .", "author": "Joe Dyke", "url":

yet to concede a single casualty .\nTo mark the sixth anniversary of Russia \u2019 s military intervention in Syria , Airwars is highlighting just five of the countless civilian harm events that characterise Russian involvement in the conflict .\nOverall since 2015 , we have identified 4,615 incidents where Russia is alleged to have caused civilian deaths or injuries .\nThis September alone , we estimate that ten civilians have been killed by alleged Russian strikes \u2013 including five children .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum of 14,216 civilians killed only in incidents Airwars has deemed fair , confirmed or contested .\nThis figure is a conservative estimate .\nAs many as 23,936 civilians overall are locally alleged to have been killed by Russian actions \u2013 among the worst tolls of any belligerent or conflict monitored by Airwars .\nHowever , many of these reported deaths are contested between Russia and the Syrian regime it supports , making clear attribution frequently challenging .\nAirwars is continuing to carry out deep research into events that took place between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updated civilian harm data expected to be released early next year .\nOur Syrian team members have selected five major incidents from our archives that show how Russia has waged war in Syria \u2013 and the ongoing cost of its operations on civilian life .\nWe focus on civilian harm caused by high-intensity vacuum missiles ; the staggering numbers of children credibly reported harmed ; the challenges of naming all victims during such a high intensity conflict ; and finally , the use of targeted attacks on healthcare workers and first responders .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia alone does not reflect the full picture of large-scale death and destruction over the past ten years of conflict in Syria .\nAirwars continues to monitor all foreign interventions in the Syrian conflict ; for example , our monitoring of US led coalition activities can be found here , while our monitoring of Turkish military engagement can be found here .\nSyrian monitoring groups \u2013 such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights ; the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights ; and the Violations Documentation Center \u2013 also continue to track the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war , most of it resulting from the actions of the Assad regime .\nVacuum or \u2018 thermobaric \u2019 missiles are a particularly deadly weapon , allegedly used by both Russian and Syrian Regime forces throughout the conflict .\nRussian forces were first accused of using vacuum missiles in Syria on the first day of airstrikes , on September 30th 2015 , in an attack that reportedly killed 18 civilians in Talbiseh .\nA doctor working at the hospital receiving casualties described the impact of the missile as causing \u201c cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke \u201d , killing civilians with \u201c enormous pressure or shrapnel that pierced their bodies and tore some of them into pieces \u201d .\nAbsolute confirmation of the use of a particular weapon in Syria remains a major challenge .\nOf the 4,615 civilian harm events categorised by Airwars as likely being Russian ( including contested events such as Russian and/or regime attacks ) , we identified 244 incidents where local sources mentioned that \u2018 vacuum missiles \u2019 had been used in the attack .\nThese strikes were found to have caused at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know for sure if vacuum missiles were used in each of these events , we have chosen to highlight one case that offers some insight into the level of destruction caused by high explosive weapons , and the complexity of such events .\nThis incident took place in April 2017 , where nine children and their grandmother were likely killed in repeated airstrikes on Ma \u2019 arat Hurma , Idlib .\nThe site was reportedly hit multiple times , with buildings almost completely raised to the ground and victims buried under many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-intensity strike , an ambulance being used to tend to the initial victims , was left burning .\nMedia outlet RFS observed that \u201c the raids were highly explosive and caused extensive destruction to civilian homes .\nSix houses and more than 25 shops were destroyed and other material damage occurred in the places where rockets fell \u201d .\nOur assessment identifies the victims likely killed in the attack \u2013 all members of the Al Nabo family , with the youngest child just two years old .\nImages posted to social media show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while a video posted by first responders , the White Helmets , show the bodies of small children being carried through the rubble .\nRead the full assessment on our website here .\nAt least 4,831 children have been reported killed by alleged Russian airstrikes in Syria since 2015 .\nIn 2016 , one of the deadliest years for civilian casualties in Syria , an average of 169 children were killed each month by alleged Russian actions .\nWhile ceasefire agreements in 2020 saw a downturn in Russian strikes , this temporary relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end , as we \u2019 ve seen the resumption of weekly , and sometimes daily , Russian airstrikes in different parts of Syria .\nIn September 2021 alone , children account for half of all deaths caused by alleged Russian strikes and almost half of all injuries .\nThis includes one child reported injured earlier this week , in alleged Russian or Syrian regime strikes on the town of Majdlaya .\nTaking the most conservative estimates \u2013 the minimum number of reported civilians killed \u2013 children could account for 34 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian strikes .\nThe indiscriminate nature of Russian airstrikes has resulted in the deaths of entire families of children , including babies just a few months old .\nTwo civilian casualty events took place over 48 hours in August 2021 , where alleged Russian airstrikes in Idlib hit two families .\nAt least eight children were killed and another injured .\nOn August 19th , four children were killed and another injured by alleged Russian or regime strikes on Balshoun .\nThree of the children were killed alongside their mother and their young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family .\nOne of the children killed was 8-year old Hamza Khaled Habib , cousin of the Ajaj family .\nIn an event that reflects the scale of civilian harm in Syria , Hamza was being raised by his uncle , as his own father had already been killed in a previous airstrike .\nThe Syrian Civil Defense ( also known as the White Helmets ) posted a video capturing Mr Mohamed Ajaj mourning for his wife , children and young nephew , all killed in this attack .\nRead our full assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day later at Kansafra , another Idlib town , another family was almost entirely killed , including at least four children \u2013 aged three , six , nine and twelve years old , members of the Al Omar family .\nA reporter with AFP saw the father crying over the bodies of three of his children in a cemetery .\nThe reporter observed that the fourth child had to be buried in a hurry , because bombing had begun again in the area .\nOnly one of the Al Omar children survived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother managed to rescue just moments before the strike .\nRead our full assessment of the incident here .\nOf all civilians alleged harmed by Russian airstrikes \u2013 estimated by Airwars at as many as 23,936 killed and 41,452 injured \u2013 we have found found full or partial names for just 8,472 individuals .\nThis means that 87 % of all civilians reported harmed in Russian strikes can not be identified using current available datasets .\nWhile on-going deeper research being conducted by Airwars might be able to address at least some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we may not know the identity of many thousands of victims until Syria \u2019 s conflict ends , and a substantial truth and reconciliation process can begin .\nThis is due to a number of reasons , not least that the use of high-intensity weapons by Russian and other forces in Syria cause significant destruction , and often make immediate identification of casualties impossible .\nSyria also houses the highest number of internally displaced people in the world , estimated by UNHCR at 6.2 million , including 2.3 million children .\nLocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims , especially those recently arrived with little documentation .\nOn March 22nd 2019 in Kafriya and Al Fou \u2019 a in Idlib , an incident that was referred to by several sources as a \u201c massacre \u201d , killed up to 28 civilians and injured as many as 30 others .\nA doctor named Abu Mohammed was quoted by Smart News as identifying more than 15 raids on the towns of Kufriya and al-Fuha and he noted that many civilians had moderate injuries , \u201c mostly children and women \u201d .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missiles was pointed out in various sources and could be one of the reasons for the difficulty identifying victims .\nDespite Airwars \u2019 researchers finding 28 unique sources reporting on the incident , we were only able to identify one individual who was killed \u2013 Ali Wahid Qalla , a 50 year old man displaced from Eastern Ghouta .\nThe identity of dozens of others , including children , remains unknown .\nRead our assessment in full on our website .\n\u2018 The death toll from the massacre committed by Russian planes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed 20 civilians , including 4 children , and more than 30 wounded , including critical cases , and 13 children .\nThese have become just numbers for the hypocritical media \u2019 In March 2020 , WHO \u2019 s Regional Emergency Director in the Eastern Mediterranean , Richard Brennan , called out the international community for ignoring attacks on healthcare facilities in Syria : \u201c What is troubling , is that we \u2019 ve come to a point where attacks on health \u2014 something the international community shouldn \u2019 t tolerate \u2013 are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become accustomed to \u201d .\nPhysicians for Human Rights ( PHR ) provide on-going monitoring of attacks on healthcare centres , noting that such operations are against International Humanitarian Law and constitute war crimes .\nAccording to PHR , 244 attacks on medical facilities have been carried out by either the Syria Regime or Russian forces .\nOne such attack was investigated by the New York Times , which showed how Russian airstrikes hit four hospitals in just 12 hours in May 2019 .\nAs PHR notes : \u201c When these attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread as they have in Syria , the consequences reach far beyond the individuals and facilities lost \u2013 the attacks reverberate across the civilian community , inciting fear that seeking medical treatment or going to a hospital will result in death , injury , kidnapping , torture , or imprisonment , both for the patient and the medical provider.\n\u201d One type of event Airwars researchers often report on during monitoring of Russian strikes in Syria , are so-called double-tap strikes \u2013 where first responders are hit in a second airstrike after an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first responders are most often the White Helmets , officially known as the Syrian Civil Defense , who report that 252 of their volunteers have been killed since the start of the conflict and over 500 volunteers injured .\nWhite Helmets continue to risk their lives and are often the only response teams available in remote or poorly resourced areas .\nAn event that took place in June 2019 is one such example , where an alleged Russian strike killed two White Helmets volunteers in Khan Sheikoun , Idlib , who were tending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe two volunteers , Ali Al Qadour and Omar Kayyal , had been in an ambulance treating victims of an initial strike in the east of Khan Sheikhoun ; another five of their colleagues were also wounded .\nThe Syrian Civil Defense published a statement that said \u201c a thorough examination of the evidence , such as eyewitness accounts and the identification of munitions used in the attack on white helmets , has proved conclusively that the aircraft that committed the crime of targeting and killing our volunteers belong to the Russian @ @ @

week marked 20 years since the US-led \u2018 War on Terror \u2019 began .\nThe conflict has been defined by a series of major military actions in which the UK has supported the US and allies in Afghanistan , Iraq , and Syria .\nThe recent chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan saw the reshuffle of Dominic Raab from the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office , amid widespread criticism for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in uncertain \u2013 and concerning \u2013 situations .\nThe UK continues to operate in Iraq and Syria with the US-led Coalition against ISIS to this day \u2013 yet refuses to hold itself truly accountable for civilians harmed by its actions in these countries , nor in historical incidents in Afghanistan .\nDespite various commitments from the UK government to \u201c investigate any credible reports that the UK actions may have caused civilian harm \u201d , there have been insufficient efforts to work with civil society organisations ; to ensure transparent cross-departmental work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation in place to truly offer change .\nAs Britain \u2019 s new Foreign Secretary , Rt .\nHon .\nLiz Truss now has the opportunity to respond to the urgent need for stronger approaches to civilian harm mitigation and monitoring policies which will allow the UK to catch up with its allies , and become more accountable for its actions .\nAirwars this week sent the Foreign Secretary an open letter outlining key improvements we believe are needed now .\nThe full text of our letter is reprinted below .\nRt .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office King Charles Street Whitehall London SW1A 2AH RE : Open letter from Airwars to the new Secretary of State for the Foreign , Commonwealth and Development Office , calling for the FCDO and MoD to work together and improve protections for civilians resulting from UK military actions .\nWe would like to congratulate you on your promotion to Foreign Secretary .\nWe look forward to working with you to improve UK policy to protect civilians in conflict .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US-led so-called War on Terror .\nThis conflict has been defined as you know by a series of major military actions in which the UK has supported the US and other allies , in Afghanistan , Iraq , and Syria .\nThese countries have been among those consistently most dangerous for civilians over the last two decades , with military actions involving explosive weapons increasingly taking place in urban environments .\nAirwars recently found , for example , that at least 22,679 and potentially as many 48,308 civilians have likely been killed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn light of the recent chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan , we are concerned about the UK government \u2019 s potential shift to remote warfare in that country , noting the Defence Secretary \u2019 s comments on 7th September that \u201c I \u2019 ll do whatever I have to do to protect citizens \u2019 lives and our interests and our allies , when we \u2019 re called upon to do so , wherever that may be.\n\u201d We reiterate our calls for robust and transparent mechanisms to mitigate , monitor , and investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from UK actions , before these actions are considered .\nAs it stands , the UK is systematically failing to hold itself accountable for civilians harmed by its own actions in the War on Terror ; and there have been insufficient efforts to adequately investigate historical instances flagged by monitoring organisations such as Airwars .\nThe most striking example of this is the UK \u2019 s insistence that there is only evidence of a single civilian casualty from the entire campaign against ISIS within the US-led Coalition in Syria and Iraq .\nOur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8,300 and as many as 13,000 civilians have likely been killed so far by the US-led Coalition , including from thousands of British airstrikes .\nThe failure of the MoD to more accurately understand and account for civilian harm on the ground from its own actions places the UK dangerously behind key allies , including the US and Netherlands .\nBelow we note our main concerns , and reiterate our urgent call for a more open and collaborative approach from the FCDO on civilian harm mitigation .\nWe would very much welcome a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest convenience .\nAs conflicts have changed over the past two decades , the UK has focused increasingly on assisting local forces through airstrikes , rather than through large-scale deployment of ground forces .\nYet such airpower-focused conflicts are much less accountable to civilians on the ground , we and our partners believe .\nUK policies to protect civilians have fallen behind other allies such as the US Department of Defense and the Dutch Ministry of Defence , which have made significant legislation-driven improvements .\nFor example , since 2018 , the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually to Congress on all civilians it deems have been killed by US actions in the past 12 months .\nNo such legislation exists in the UK ; and key recommendations from the Chilcot report , \u201c to make every reasonable effort to identify and understand the likely and actual effects of its military actions on civilians , \u201d have yet to be implemented .\nWe are also concerned that the current MoD review methodology used to determine only one civilian casualty from its ongoing seven year campaign against ISIS in Iraq and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exceptionally high \u2018 proof \u2019 threshold currently applied within the Department when assessing civilian harm claims .\nIn other words , this low estimate of civilian harm is a reflection of poor evidence gathering and analysis , not of effective strategies to protect civilians .\nThe FCDO leads the UK Approach to the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict .\nYet despite commitments made to \u201c investigate any credible reports that the UK actions may have caused civilian harm , \u201d there has yet to be any published evidence of change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how the MoD and FCDO intend to protect affected communities in the recent Integrated Review , nor how the \u201c Conflict Centre \u201d will work cross-department , or be resourced for these areas .\n1 .\nWill the MoD consider assessing its current methodology to determine civilian harm and publish the results of these assessments ?\n2 .\nWill the FCDO publish its most recent assessment to show how it plans to meet commitments in the UK Approach to the Protection of Civilians ?\n3 .\nWill the FCDO and MoD publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work together on civilian harm mitigation , including with the Conflict Centre and conflict strategy ?\nThe MoD and FCDO commitment to work with civil society organisations to better protect civilians in regions where the UK is operating has decreased to concerning levels .\nAirwars has been keen to offer meaningful feedback on policies and operations and to work together with MoD to investigate and re-investigate instances of potential civilian harm when it has been flagged from our monitoring and investigations .\nFor example , the UK still admits evidence of only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the US-led Coalition .\nWe note with concern that recently , the Pentagon wrongly claimed responsibility to Congress for civilian harm from a series of historical strikes , that were actually carried out by its allies , including the UK .\nAirwars remains the primary public reference for locally reported reported civilian harm events from international and domestic military actions tracked across Syria , Libya , and Iraq , involving air delivered munitions \u2013 and is therefore a critical reference point for affected local communities , for media and analysts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combatant commands .\nThere has never been the same level of engagement with the UK and MoD .\nWe feel that this is a wasted opportunity ; meaningful dialogue between the MoD and civil society organisations could contribute significant value to the planning , design , implementation and evaluation of military operations and security partnerships , while reinforcing effective governance and oversight .\nAs the new Foreign Secretary , we reiterate our calls to you for the UK to create and institutionalise systematic engagement with civil society organisations , where civil society can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transparency in the conduct of operations and civilian harm monitoring .\n4 .\nWill the MoD consider investigating and re-investigating where necessary specific instances of civilian harm caused by UK airstrikes with the US-led Coalition in Iraq and Syria flagged by civil society monitoring organisations , and publish the results ?\n5 .\nWill you recommend MoD and FCDO officials to meet with Airwars to discuss better practise recommendations and to encourage a meaningful relationship between civil society organisations and your Departments ?\nThank you for taking the time to note our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best in your new role , while looking forward to working with you on these issues .", "author": "Georgia

began their own presence with the declared aim to install \u201c security , stability and the rule of law.\n\u201d This anniversary happens after last month saw a wave of resignations by senior Ministerial staff and frank debate across Parliaments in Europe , including in relation to the sudden and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan .\nAirwars and Center for Civilians in Conflict ( CIVIC ) urge the new ministers to take a frank look at the mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been done differently .\nThe public and political criticism surrounding the withdrawal of the United States and its allies from Afghanistan and the devastating humanitarian crisis unfolding in Afghanistan , sends a strong message about the urgent need for stronger approaches to civilian harm mitigation , transparency and accountability policies in future military operations .\nWe encourage the new ministers in the Netherlands and in the UK to learn about the risks to civilians caught in armed conflict in planning phases for any military operations , so they may work towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to commit to improving transparency and accountability for civilian harm , including by consistently tracking , investigating , publicly acknowledging , and amending harm through compensation payments , apologies , and other offerings in accordance with victims \u2019 needs and preferences .\nWe extend the same call to the United States and other NATO nations .\nThis is especially important because the risk to civilians in Afghanistan is not unique .\nIn fact , in the 20 years since the terrorist attacks of 9/11 , we have seen risks to civilians multiply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world .\nWar is now increasingly fought in urban environments with long-lasting and lethal effects .\nNATO members , increasingly hesitant to deploy \u201c boots on the ground , \u201d have relied instead on supporting local forces through air support \u2013 even when local partners may lack the capacity to protect

devastating civilian communities in the process .\nAs risks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for harm is diminishing .\nIn Iraq and Syria , the UK still only admits one civilian death over the course of its operation , despite declaring thousands of UK airstrikes and despite Airwars \u2019 own assessment showing that at least 8,300 civilians have likely been killed by the US-led Coalition .\nWe urge all NATO nations to take heed of these past mistakes , which had devastating and continuing consequences on the lives of civilians .\nAs Liz Truss starts as the new UK Foreign Secretary , and as the new Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Foreign Minister , Ben Knapen , begin their tenure , we urge them to immediately take the following steps : \u2022 Recognise publicly and through a revision of doctrine , the imperative of civilian harm mitigation , transparency , and accountability in all aspects of defence and foreign affairs , including in their nations \u2019 own operations as well as \u201c train , advise , and assist \u201d missions .\n\u2022 Prioritise resourcing for the monitoring and tracking of civilian harm in current and future military deployments .\n\u2022 Commit to investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian harm from Afghanistan and other operations over the past 20 years , including by issuing compensation or solatia payments ; and commit to applying these policies and practices in all future operations .\n\u2022 Adopt and implement clear policies for civilian harm tracking , mitigation and response through consultation with civil society experts , which are adequately resourced at all areas of deployment .\n\u2022 Incorporate open-source information from civil society , the media , and other external sources into civilian harm assessments and investigations .\n\u2022 Publish the specific date ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of target for all weapon deployments in the anti-ISIS Coalition from 2014 to the present day and in all future operations .\n\u2022 Publish regular reports on

"content": "Airwars speaks to PAX about their recent visit to the still-devastated city of Hawijah in Iraq , and interviews with 119 survivors .\nAirwars \u2019 Netherlands-based advocacy partner , PAX for Peace , is currently undertaking research in the Iraqi city of Hawijah , where a 2015 US-led Coalition strike against ISIS led to the deaths of at least 70 civilians and the injuring of hundreds more .\nOn the night of June 2nd-3rd 2015 , Dutch F-16s bombed an ISIS Vehicle-Borne Improvised Devices ( VBIED ) factory in Hawijah .\nSecondary explosions then destroyed a large area of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deadly event for more than four years , the Dutch government eventually took public responsibility in November 2019 .\nPAX \u2019 s new research will examine many of the questions that came from the joint report that Airwars and PAX released in October 2020 , \u2018 Seeing Through the Rubble \u2019 .\nWe conducted a Q & A with the PAX team to hear more about their recent visit to Hawijah and upcoming report .\nAs you \u2019 ll read from eyewitness reports in this article , the Dutch must urgently hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their tragic actions in Hawijah , and other incidents with the US-led Coalition in Iraq and Syria .\nThe Airwars \u2019 Advocacy Team spoke to Roos Boer , Project Leader for Humanitarian Disarmament at PAX , and Saba Azeem , Project Leader for the Human Security Survey ( Iraq ) .\nAirwars : Thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us .\nTo start off , can you describe for someone who doesn \u2019 t already know the details of the story , what happened in Hawijah on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So on this particular night , a Coalition airstrike targeted an ISIS munitions factory in Hawijah , which was located in the industrial area .\nThe strike was conducted by the Dutch .\nIn this factory , a very large supply of TNT [ dynamite ] was stored , which detonated after the first impact .\nWhen we were talking to people there , people described that it felt like a nuclear attack in terms of the destruction .\nSaba : It is also important to understand that there is no clear demarcation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial area \u2019 , and \u2018 this is solely a residential area \u2019 \u2013 they are often quite intertwined .\nSo to say that it only targeted the industrial area and that there were no residential areas around would also be a very narrow description of the context .\nSecondly , there was about 18,000 kilos of TNT in the munitions factory which exploded .\nIt left a crater 11 meters deep and 20 meters wide .\nAnd apparently in Kirkuk , which is 50 kilometers away , the shock was measured at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s how big it was .\nWhat were the immediate consequences for the local population , and how did the Dutch government and military initially respond to the high number of civilian casualties resulting from this strike ?\nRoos : The explosions directly led to at least 70 civilian deaths and hundreds of civilians being injured .\nIn addition to that direct impact on civilians , 400-500 buildings were reportedly destroyed ; this includes homes and schools , factories and shops .\nThe electricity transmission station was located in the area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cetera .\nSo there was a lot of immediate harm but it \u2019 s also leading to longer term impacts where services are disrupted .\nIt \u2019 s also very important to mention that it was a really big chaotic event .\nPeople didn \u2019 t know what was going on , they couldn \u2019 t see anything , there was dust everywhere , bodies and body parts everywhere , and this led to a lot of trauma for people .\nThe psychosocial harm has been immense .\nYou also asked how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very interesting question because they didn \u2019 t .\nIt was not until 2019 , so that \u2019 s four years after the attack , following publications by the NOS and the NRC , who are part of the media in the Netherlands , that the Dutch Ministry of Defense publicly took responsibility for the air strikes .\nSo there has been a big lack of transparency .\nThey assessed in their CDE [ Collateral Damage Estimation ] that the secondary explosions would not extend beyond the industrial area , which was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already mentioned .\nAfter the attack in September 2015 , it was announced that they will increase the scrutiny of targets in populated areas which have the expected potential for secondary explosions .\nIt sparked , of course , a very intense debate in the Netherlands because the Parliament also was not informed about the events .\nSo there were a lot of questions being asked in Parliament about transparency and accountability .\nAs a result , the then-Dutch Minister of Defense , [ Ank ] Bijleveld , announced greater transparency in informing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dutch government also announced that they would contribute $ 4 million US dollars to rebuilding the infrastructure .\nThey very clearly were not interested in giving individual compensation , but just in giving a more general contribution to the reconstruction of Hawijah .\nThis was promised 10 months ago , and we understand the money is being contracted through the UNDP/FFS [ United Nations Development Programme \u2019 s Funding Facility of Stabilisation ] , and the IOM [ International Organization for Migration ] .\nHowever , we haven \u2019 t seen much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 or contributing to the people we spoke to in Hawijah .\nSaba : And linking to what Roos already said , the Dutch have claimed responsibility , but they have not apologized , which is quite appalling .\nIn terms of the destruction , we have seen eight car showrooms completely destroyed , the Hawijah municipality department building , the electricity department building , the civil defence department [ building and vehicles ] , four ice factories , at least five or six brick factories , one flour mill all have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost their livelihoods .\nAlso the [ Dutch ] scope of calculating the casualties has been very narrow .\nThe area was besieged , and the general hospital was under ISIS control .\nSo they were not treating any civilian injuries or deaths .\nSo where does this number come from ?\nYou mentioned that the Dutch government only started talking about this in 2019 after journalists exposed the story .\nBut do you have a sense of when they knew about the civilian harm that had occurred ?\nSaba : From what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Defense knew within a few weeks .\nWe did see that after the strike quite a lot of news channels reported it , even the ISIS news channel at the time , released footage which European channels then used .\nThere was also a press conference by a US General saying that there was a munition factory in Hawijah that was hit .\nSo I think it was within days of this happening , the Coalition and the international community knew of the airstrike .\nWhether the Dutch knew that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different question .\nRoos : Regardless of whether they did or didn \u2019 t know ; if they knew , then it \u2019 s rather problematic that they didn \u2019 t report it , if they didn \u2019 t know , to me that is very problematic too because they are responsible for assessing the impacts of their weapons .\nSo just as a separate remark about this .\nIn October last year , PAX and Airwars released our report , \u2018 Seeing Through the Rubble \u2019 .\nWhat were the main findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seeing Through the Rubble \u2019 was a joint report of Airwars and PAX .\nWe examined the longer term effects on civilian populations of the international military campaigns in Mosul , Raqqa , and Hawijah .\nWe especially looked at the use of explosive weapons in populated areas , because we know there is a worldwide pattern of how these weapons in populated areas impact civilians .\nThe longer term effects and reverberating effects are often under-reported .\nBut we know that when explosive weapons are being used in populated areas , nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So that \u2019 s a very alarming number .\nAnd [ \u2018 Seeing Through the Rubble \u2019 ] painted a rather grim image of how the destruction was still there , how difficult it is for people to pick up their lives if their cities are destroyed by our militaries .\nAnd then I think it was a good snapshot of the situation .\nBut when we started researching , it only created more questions , so I was very happy that we could continue our research into Hawjiah , and visit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a much more in-depth piece of research interviewing many of the survivors in Hawijah .\nI am sure she can tell you more about it .\nYou \u2019 ve recently been engaging in this research on the ground in Hawijah .\nIt would be great to hear about what you \u2019 re currently researching and how you \u2019 re going about investigating this , in a bit more detail .\nSaba : The research , which started in February this year , is being done by a consortium led by PAX , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utrecht University and al-Ghad League for Woman and Child Care as partners .\nOut of the 119 civilians interviewed thus far , 62 lost their loved ones , whereas the rest either sustained injuries or material damage .\nThe research is looking at these reverberating effects and examining how \u2013 six and a half years later \u2013 civilian lives are still impacted heavily by the airstrikes .\nBecause this was a besieged area , those who were injured were either not treated in a timely manner or not treated properly , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe psychological trauma can not even be measured .\nFor instance , there is a gentleman we met , who lost seven members of his family including five of his children .\nHow do you rebuild your life from there ?\nOr the child who has had his face burned off and he is being bullied in school and has been forced to drop out because of this bullying \u2013 how can you even compensate for that ?\nSo it was heartbreaking hearing these individual stories , and meeting the people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also showed us how we failed as the humanitarian community in actually addressing these issues , which were caused by Dutch actions .\nRoos : One of the interviewees asked me directly , \u201c Are we less human than you are ?\nIf this factory was located in a Dutch city , would you have done it in the same way ?\n\u201d And those , I think , are very spot on questions and very rightfully asked .\nSaba : And to say that civilians are not aware , that is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether they were authorities or civilians on the ground knew exactly what happened .\nWe were asked how long it took for victims of Srebrenica to get their compensations , so they could calculate how long it would take them .\nSo these are very well-informed people .\nEverybody wanted an apology from the Dutch \u2013 a formal apology by the Dutch government and by the parties who carried out the strike , as well as individual compensation .\nThank you for that .\nSo did your findings confirm the conclusions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saba : This research confirmed the findings and then also added a very direct civilian voice to it .\nI think so far , most of the studies that have been taking place are usually looking at data from a distance , or maybe interviewing three to five civilians .\nBut now we have the voices from over 119 .\nDoes Hawijah continue to be affected by the strike , and is it still obvious when you visit the city today ?\nSaba : For us , that was one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term , aspect ; that six and a half years later , you still see the rubble on the ground , which until now has not been cleared .\nYou see that the hospital is still \u2013 a very major part of it \u2013 in prefabricated containers .\nWe met a woman whose daughter was injured in the attack .\nShe was 14 then , so about 20 now .\nAnd she was also worried that now that she has these prominent scars because of the injuries , who would marry her ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ were injured , now can \u2019 t go to school , because they have to earn a livelihood .\nWe got reports , which are yet to be confirmed , of children in primary schools , who are suffering from chronic diseases , like heart issues , high blood pressure and diabetes , because they \u2019 re so stressed by their trauma that happened six and a half years ago .\nSo the city is very much completely at a standstill and it is still suffering from these aftershocks of what happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wounded city .\nIt \u2019 s not like a huge city , but it \u2019 s a city with this roundabout , and if you take the wrong turn , you are in a pile of rubble .\nIf you take the other turn , you see so many small commercial activities taking place .\nIt is a wounded city with multiple faces .\nAnd the people that were affected , that were injured , they sold everything that they still had , to be able to pay for this first [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] , including shelling injuries or amputations .\nThey had nothing before , then they sold their jewellery or whatever they had to pay for this treatment and after that they were left with nothing .\nAnd they basically live off what other people are giving to them .\nIt \u2019 s a very hopeless feeling if you talk to these people .\nSaba : Like the hospital , for instance , it used to have a surgical wing , and now they don \u2019 t have the capacity for conducting surgeries anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for chronic diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure .\nPeople now have to travel 50 kilometers to Kirkuk , or have to spend their own money to get medicines [ from private hospitals or pharmacies ] that they need on a daily basis .\nThey had 5,400 teachers before , and now there \u2019 s only 3,200 left .\nSo you see these , these very visible sort of things as well .\nGiving numbers is one thing , but then when you meet the humans and you can paint a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe met this gentleman who tried to commit suicide twice , because he used to be one of the richest people in Hawijah and then he lost everything.. And when we asked him , so all of this has happened and how would you like to sort of address it all ?\nAnd he said , \u201c All I want is death because I am done living.\n\u201d How do you respond to that ?\nThank you for depicting these long lasting effects and very human tragedies .\nSo finally , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit , but I thought maybe you could just tell us about how the people of Hawijah think of the way that the Dutch have held themselves to account over this incident .\nSaba : Well , as Roos already mentioned one of the questions we were asked was if the Dutch had different definitions of human rights ?\nThey were saying that you expect things like that from ISIS , which is a terrorist entity , but you don \u2019 t expect things like this from the Dutch , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also had statements saying that they do not trust the Dutch government , however they do trust the Dutch justice system .\nSo if they \u2019 re not given the justice that they deserve , then they will go to court and they will try and get their rights through the formal legal system .\nBut then , across the board , whether it is authorities or whether it \u2019 s civilians , they do name the Dutch very outwardly and very clearly .\nFor instance , in the debate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given to the Dutch by the Americans .\nSo when I asked them why not blame the Americans and they actually had a very interesting answer , which we do not disagree with : They said the American intelligence was flawed during the Gulf war , the American intelligence was proved wrong in 2003 , when they said there were weapons of mass destruction .\nSo why are the Dutch still trusting the Americans ?\nThe person or entity carrying out the airstrike , they also have their own own minds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t they trusting their own facilities for that measure ?\nThank you very much for sharing this incredible research with us .\nThose are all our questions .\nDo you have anything final to add before we end ?\nSaba : The research report will hopefully be out in January .\nHopefully we can add a lot more to the debate and also show multiple entities around the world , whether it \u2019 s NATO states or other nations joining international coalitions , or take part in this kind of warfare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the direct harm into account .\nThese reverberating effects often are even worse [ and longer lasting ] than the direct effects .\nSo in the targeting process we firmly believe that this also needs to be integrated .\nIt will be on our site and on the Intimacies of Remote Warfare website .\nAnd there will also be a public launch .\nAnd we will definitely share it widely on our social media as well .\nSo it should be readily available to anyone looking for it .\nThank you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nSaba : Thank you for , for touching on this important subject .\nThank you .", "author": "Georgia Edwards", "url":

standard methodology to examine how , when , and where civilians are killed in urban conflicts .\nThe report chronicles civilian casualties from two very different military campaigns by the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) .\nAmong the report \u2019 s key findings are : \u2022 Across the three conflict areas , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those areas bombed were critical drivers of civilian harm , leading to profoundly different outcomes for civilians .\n\u2022 In Gaza between 151 and 192 civilians were likely killed as a result of IDF actions in May 2021 , mostly in densely populated areas .\nAt least a third of those killed were children .\nBetween 15 and 20 civilian deaths in Gaza were additionally likely to have resulted from Palestinian misfires .\n\u2022 10 civilians were directly killed in Israel in May 2021 resulting from Palestinian militant actions \u2013 with most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s \u2018 Iron Dome \u2019 defence system and reached cities and towns .\n\u2022 In Syria , an extensive IDF air campaign since 2013 has had a far smaller impact on civilians .\nIsraeli strikes have likely killed at least 14 and up to 40 Syrian civilians , with attacks mostly focused on exclusively military targets , away from population centres .\n\u2022 Airwars has produced an interactive map showing its findings for Gaza , which can be viewed here .\nThe map allows users to navigate through 128 individual assessments of civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting testimony to the civilian victims of the conflict .\nIsrael \u2019 s longtime rival Iran has been active within near neighbour Syria since civil war erupted a decade ago , with Tehran helping to prop up President Bashar al-Assad \u2019 s regime .\nBeginning in January 2013 , Israel has periodically carried out attacks within Syria to counter Iranian entrenchment .\nStrikes have targeted Iranian and Syrian troops , as well as militias from multiple countries aligned with Tehran .\nAirwars has tracked Israeli strikes in Syria for several years as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there by all foreign actors .\nIt has now published interactive mapping of all locally reported allegations against Israel in Syria .\nIt \u2019 s believed to be the first comprehensive assessment of the civilian toll of an extensive but secretive air campaign .\nAirwars researchers also recorded civilian harm from Israeli military strikes during the May 2021 eruption of violence in Gaza , alongside harm caused by rockets fired into Israel by Palestinian militants .\nSince 2008 Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip have fought four major combat operations .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May 2021 in order to provide comparative data with the more limited civilian harm events being reported from Israeli strikes in Syria .\nAfter compiling all community-reported civilian harm events in the conflicts in Syria and Gaza , Airwars researchers found that one of the critical explainers behind the dramatically different outcomes for civilians was where the IDF chooses to bomb .\nAccording to local reports , the great majority of Israeli actions in Syria have targeted military assets such as air bases , troop convoys and weapons stores , away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militants were killed in these operations , for the most part in military settings .\nIn Gaza , the picture was very different .\nStrikes routinely hit residential neighbourhoods , and militants were frequently targeted in non-military settings : Airwars identified 17 locally reported incidents in which militants were targeted in residential buildings and in which civilians were killed or injured nearby .\nIn those incidents , local reports found that between 27 and 33 civilians were killed , with more than 100 injured .\nOne third of those killed in the Gaza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 56 and 68 civilians killed when the IDF targeted what they said was a Hamas militant tunnel network beneath heavily populated areas in Gaza City , leading the buildings above to collapse .\nMost of the deaths came from a single incident : in the early morning of May 16th , at least 41 civilians were killed in strikes on the residential al-Wahda street , of which up to 18 were children .\nRiyad Ishkontana , 42 , lost his wife and four of his children in the al-Wahda street attack .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bombing reassuring the young family they were safe : their building was in an area of professionals and shops , he told them .\nBut in the early hours of the morning , as Ishkontana was out getting snacks , the building was hit .\nOnly one of his children survived .\n\u201c I wish I never left , \u201d he told The New York Times .\nAirwars also mapped all civilian harm allegations in Gaza , Syria and Israel against population density , and found a second clear driver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area , the more civilians were killed .\nIn Gaza , one of the most heavily populated places in the world , more than 1,500 declared Israeli air and artillery strikes hit the territory in just 11 days .\nThis dramatically increased the likelihood of civilian harm .\nEven within Gaza , there was a clear trend \u2013 the more heavily populated a neighbourhood , the more civilians died there .\nThe trend was also noticeable in Syria .\nWhile the scale of civilian harm from IDF strikes was much lower than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located in heavily populated areas .\nAround 45 percent of estimated civilian casualties from Israeli strikes since 2013 occurred in the capital Damascus .\nIn Israel , 17 of the 33 reported civilian harm incidents resulting from Palestinian rockets also took place in more densely populated areas , Airwars found .\nPopulation density in Gaza may have given some a false sense of security .\nOn May 12th in Gaza , airstrikes killed Reema Saad , who was four months pregnant , alongside her two children and husband .\nThe family had decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed the densely populated neighbourhood would be immune from targeting , Reema \u2019 s mother Samia told Middle East Eye .\nThe new findings support what Airwars has found across all conflicts it monitors : that using wide area effect explosive weapons in populated urban areas leads to high levels of civilian deaths and injuries .\nThis phenomenon is certainly not restricted to actions by the IDF , or by Palestinian militant groups .\nIndeed , the Gaza campaign in particular can be seen as part of a profoundly worrying trend in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in urban areas , often with devastating results .\nHigh civilian casualties in Gaza are symptomatic of an escalating and troubling global military trend in the use of wide area effect weapons in populated areas ( sometimes known as EWIPA ) \u2013 seen from Gaza to Mosul , Aleppo to Raqqa , and Tripoli to Kabul .\nThese latest findings lend further urgency to an ongoing international push to restrict their use in a United Nations-brokered Political Declaration by nations , expected to be finalised in early 2022 .\n\u201c Our latest study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large scale conflicts in Iraq , Syria and elsewhere : even technologically advanced militaries kill large numbers of civilians when attacks focus on urban centres , \u201d Chris Woods , director at Airwars , said .\n\u201c Despite repeated assurances to the contrary , it \u2019 s clear that \u2018 precision warfare \u2019 can not sufficiently mitigate civilian harm.\n\u201d \u201c Stark differences in civilian deaths and injuries from Israeli actions in Syria and in the Gaza Strip clearly illustrate that the most significant driver of civilian harm remains the use of explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effective way to reduce the number of civilians dying in warfare would be to restrict the use of such dangerous wide area effect weapons on urban centres.\n\u201d How the new research was carried out The Airwars report is the result of months of meticulous research carried out by a team of local language researchers , geolocators and specialist assessors .\nThousands of local media , social media and official sources documenting civilian harm as it happened were identified and archived by Airwars \u2019 team of Arabic- , Hebrew- and English-language researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gaza and Israel .\nResearchers also continue to monitor and archive all civilian harm allegations in Syria resulting from Israeli strikes since 2013 .\nAirwars has then assessed the civilian harm from each incident in Gaza , Syria and Israel using the same standard methodology it applies across all conflicts it monitors .\nIts approach can best be described as remote , original language hyperlocal monitoring of casualty claims by affected communities \u2013 along with a review of broader reports and claims by belligerents , media and other investigators .\nAll assessments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any credible new information relating to an event will be subsequently added , potentially affecting our

Syria: A Tale of Two Israeli Air Wars", "content": "Airwars has found that 10 times more civilians were killed in 11 days of Israel \u2019 s bombing of Gaza than in the entirety of its 8-year campaign in Syria This article was originally published by Newlines on December 9th 2021 and written by Airwars \u2019 Investigations Team .\nOn Jan. 13 , 2021 , the Israeli military launched some of its most intensive strikes to date in Syria .\nOver several hours , perhaps two dozen sites of Iranian-linked armed groups were hit over a vast territory in the Deir ez-Zor region near the Iraqi border .\nAt least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities did not report a single civilian casualty .\nFour months later , the might of the Israeli military targeted a very different location .\nOn the night of May 15 , a series of airstrikes hit the Al-Rimal neighborhood of central Gaza City .\nAt least 44 civilians reportedly died .\nMultiple families were nearly wiped out after taking shelter in a neighborhood previously thought to be safe .\nSome Hamas militants may also have been killed in underground tunnels , the announced target of the strikes by the Israel Defense Forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclear .\nThe death tolls on those nights were not an anomaly \u2014 they form part of a clear trend .\nThe Israeli military has fought two largely aerial campaigns in recent years .\nOne is a yearslong campaign to prevent the Iranian military and its allies from entrenchment in Syria , the other a brief but fierce war with Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza in May .\nThe effect on civilians could hardly be more stark .\nNew research by Airwars has found that up to 10 times more civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gaza than in the entirety of Israel \u2019 s eight-year campaign in Syria .\nIn Syria , several hundred secretive Israeli strikes since 2013 have likely killed as many as 40 civilians .\nRough tallies suggest hundreds \u2014 and likely thousands \u2014 of Iranian and Syrian military personnel and militants of other nations were killed in these strikes .\nCivilian casualties from the Israeli campaign appear to be dramatically lower than those resulting from other foreign powers operating in Syria \u2014 including Russia , Turkey and the U.S.-led coalition .\nIn Gaza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 10 and 21 , from 151 to 192 civilians were likely killed by Israeli airstrikes , according to a comprehensive review of local community reporting by Airwars .\nWhile this research didn \u2019 t estimate the number of militants killed , Israeli rights group B \u2019 Tselem put it at 90 .\nThe Israeli actions in Gaza and Syria are usually thought of separately \u2014 with comparisons between the two rare .\nBut how did a military that runs such a careful campaign in one theater end up killing so many civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nOur research pointed to three main reasons for the discrepancies .\nThe first is the type of targets chosen by the IDF in the two contexts .\nIsrael \u2019 s targeting system bears many similarities to that of its closest ally , the United States .\nIn fact , Israeli military lawyers pioneered the legal justifications for the targeted assassinations that later became a hallmark of the war on terror .\nUntil 2000 , Israel legally considered Palestinian opposition a matter of law enforcement , said Daniel Reisner , then head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department .\nBut following the outbreak of the second Palestinian uprising , or intifada , the Israeli military effectively invented a \u201c hybrid \u201d model to apply the laws of armed conflict \u2014 normally meant to apply only between states at war \u2014 to the West Bank and Gaza .\nCraig Jones , a lecturer at Newcastle University and author of a recent book on Israeli and U.S. military lawyers , said by expanding the concept of \u201c direct participation in hostilities , \u201d Israel effectively invented a new category of potential target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify a widespread campaign of targeted assassinations .\n\u201c Essentially , once a Palestinian \u2018 participates \u2019 by the broad Israeli standards , he or she can not put down arms and remains targetable even when resting at home , \u201d Jones said .\nReisner recalled that U.S. officials initially criticized the policy but after 9/11 \u201c started calling for advice.\n\u201d Later U.S. official justifications for drone strikes included lines lifted almost directly from Israeli policy , he said .\nThis legal justification allowed for more freedom in targeting Palestinian militants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm still needed to be considered and precautions taken , it was accepted by the Israeli system that hitting a militant at home was potentially justified .\nWhen the Gaza conflict started on May 10 , the IDF would have had dozens of targets that had been preapproved \u2014 meaning they had already been through legal and military review .\n\u201c The IDF would have taken out of its drawers plans that were pre-prepared and reviewed legally , \u201d said Liron Libman , former head of the International Law Department at the IDF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the basis for an order .\nTo turn it into an operational order , you still need to assess the information again.\n\u201d It seems likely that many of those preapproved targets were the homes of militants .\nAirwars tracked 17 locally reported incidents in which militants were explicitly targeted in residential buildings and civilians were killed or injured .\nMost took place in the first four days of the conflict , suggesting that they were in a preapproved target bank .\nIn those 17 incidents , local reports found that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also from 27 to 33 civilians , with more than 100 injured .\nIn one incident on May 13 , four civilians were killed and 15 more , including seven children , were injured .\nThe target was a three-story house in the Al Jeniya neighborhood , where four families lived .\nOne of the dead , Raed Ibrahim al-Rantisi , was identified by the al-Qassam Brigades as one of their fighters .\nThe family had gathered for Eid dinner .\nIn Syria , such incidents are rare , though not unheard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his family were killed in a strike in central Damascus in November 2019 .\nBut in general , strikes in Syria seem to target militants at exclusively military targets such as weapons warehouses close to land borders .\nSome of the civilian harm associated with Israeli strikes may even have been a result of Syrian air defense missiles missing their targets and hitting civilian homes .\nThe IDF \u2019 s practice of striking homes in Gaza also contributed to the high percentage of children killed , with more than one-third of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn Syria the figure is around 10 % .\nLikewise , when Israeli forces killed a civilian in Syria , more than 70 % of the time they also harmed a militant , whereas in Gaza that ratio was in the 30 % range .\n\u201c In Syria we bomb military targets , while in Gaza we strike civilian areas , so we end up bombing families , \u201d said Yehuda Shaul , of the Israeli human rights organization Breaking the Silence , which is made up of former IDF military personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain these very different outcomes for civilians in Syria and Gaza is population density .\nGaza is among the most heavily populated territories in the world , which dramatically increases the likelihood of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure for every strike carried out .\nWe mapped every reported civilian harm incident in Gaza and every recorded strike location tracked by the United Nations , against population density .\nEven within Gaza , civilian casualty incidents were clustered around areas of relatively high population density , such as in Gaza City to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars , in May the Israeli military started its bombardment by hitting heavily populated areas and high-rise buildings , \u201d said Yamen Al Madhoun , fieldwork director at the Gaza-based Palestinian rights organization Al Mezan .\n\u201c Normally , people flee the perimeter areas where Israeli troops are stationed [ and go ] to schools and relatives \u2019 homes in cities .\nBut if civilian areas are the primary target , where can people go ?\n\u201d Population density may also have provided some victims with a false sense of security .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-Hawa neighborhood apparently targeting Hamas \u2019 military wing destroyed two residential buildings .\nReema Saad , who was four months pregnant , was killed alongside her two children and husband .\nThe family had decided to stay in their apartment because they believed the densely populated neighborhood would be immune from strikes , Reema \u2019 s mother Samia told Middle East Eye .\nSamir Zaqout , Al Mezan \u2019 s deputy director , said civilians had no idea how best to stay safe .\n\u201c Fear , panic and confusion spread among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation , so people were carrying their possessions and sometimes other family members while fleeing on foot.\n\u201d The Israeli military frequently notes that Hamas has placed military infrastructure in civilian neighborhoods in Gaza City , pointing to alleged tunnel networks as violations of the laws of war .\nIsraeli officials also argue many of the more than 4,000 rockets fired by Hamas and Islamic Jihad from Gaza came from heavily populated neighborhoods .\nBut critics point out that hitting such neighborhoods overwhelmingly leads to civilian harm .\n\u201c Israeli authorities have shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Omar Shakir of Human Rights Watch said .\n\u201c They have a quite loose definition of what is a \u2018 military target , \u2019 and they have consistently bombed in heavily populated neighborhoods without considering the civilian ramifications.\n\u201d \u201c The rules and principles found in customary international humanitarian law to protect civilians should be followed , \u201d Zaqout said .\n\u201c Israel \u2019 s high-level military technology enables its forces to do so \u2014 to ensure the lawfulness of a target prior to attack .\nIf circumstances are unclear , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally dedicated to civilian purposes to be civilian.\n\u201d Even in Syria , the trend is noticeable .\nWhile the scale of civilian harm from IDF strikes is far lower than in Gaza , it is still overwhelmingly located in heavily populated areas , particularly the capital of Damascus \u2014 where around 45 % of the estimated civilian harm occurred .\nIn rural Deir ez-Zor Israel has carried out extensive strikes for more than five years , killing hundreds of militants and Iranian and Syrian military personnel along the way , without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBy contrast , both the U.S.-led coalition and Russian forces have caused often devastating numbers of civilian casualties during their own campaigns in Syria \u2014 primarily driven by extensive strikes on urban centers .\nSuch concerns chime with widespread calls for limits on the use of explosive weapons in populated areas .\nA U.N.-backed campaign now involving more than 120 nations \u2014 to forge a political statement that could help limit explosive weapons use in urban areas \u2014 is being led by Ireland , though so far no major military powers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A third possible factor helping explain why outcomes for civilians differ so radically between Israeli campaigns is one that is harder to prove \u2014 that the Israeli military has different , and more expansive , rules of engagement ( RoE ) for strikes in Gaza compared with Syria .\nSuch RoEs govern when militaries are allowed to use force and , in the event that a strike is likely to kill civilians , determine how many casualties are deemed \u201c acceptable.\n\u201d There are no internationally agreed-upon rules of how many civilians can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law requires only that it be \u201c proportional \u201d to the military advantage gained .\nAt one point during the presidency of Barack Obama , U.S. generals in Iraq were allowed to carry out strikes they expected might kill up to 10 civilians , whereas the same figure in Afghanistan was at times set at just one , given the political sensitivities of civilian harm .\nMultiple sources said the Israeli military does not internally quantify these \u201c acceptable \u201d tolls quite so explicitly , preferring instead to be \u201c very context specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute , said .\nThe country has never released its RoEs for Syria or Gaza , and it is unlikely to do so .\nA recent study found that Israeli military officers in general were significantly more conservative in their view of acceptable levels of civilian harm in discussions on proportionality as compared with their U.S. counterparts .\nThe study , by universities in Israel , the U.S. and the U.K. , found that in an imagined case of targeting an enemy headquarters , the median number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tolerate in order to achieve military gains was 175 , while Israeli officers were willing to accept 30 such casualties .\nThe IDF also likes to highlight its policy of warning civilians in Gaza before some airstrikes , a practice not widely adopted by other military actors .\nYet these are the exception rather than the rule \u2014 in the 136 civilian harm incidents Airwars researchers tracked , the vast majority of targets had reportedly received no warnings .\nAccording to Breaking the Silence , when there is imminent threat to populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out strikes that threaten civilian lives .\n\u201c When there is even the slightest threat to Israeli lives , concern for Palestinian civilians all but goes out the window , \u201d Shaul said .\nReisner didn \u2019 t dispute that the calculations were different in Gaza .\n\u201c If I see an enemy about to fire a rocket at an Israeli city , the proportionality calculation would be different than if I saw the same individual at home knowing he is planning an attack in three days , \u201d he said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 it is a horrible sentence , but [ it is the reality ] .\n\u201d Hamas and Islamic Jihad also posed a far more imminent threat than Iranian groups in Syria , said Amos Guiora , a professor at S.J .\nQuinney College of Law at the University of Utah and another former senior Israeli military lawyer .\n\u201c With the Iranians you can afford to wait for the right time , \u201d he said .\nPolitics may also play into it .\nGuiora said that the potential for a political fallout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage caution .\nIsrael has long had de facto control over the Palestinian territories but open involvement in Syria could risk a backlash at a time when Israel has secured landmark deals with Arab states including the United Arab Emirates .\n\u201c An unacceptable number of civilian deaths opens the door to blowback and bounce back , in the court of international opinion , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Maybe from a geopolitical perspective , extra caution is necessary in Syria .\n\u201d",

.\nThe release of classified records of recent US airstrikes in Afghanistan has revealed more than 400 previously undeclared actions in the last months of Donald Trump \u2019 s presidency \u2013 and at least 300 more strikes ordered by Joe Biden \u2019 s administration .\nEven after the United States and the Taliban signed an effective peace agreement in February 2020 , the US continued secretly to bomb Taliban and Islamic State targets , the data shows .\nAnd during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramp up attacks on Afghan government forces , and advance on Kabul \u2013 more than 800 munitions were fired by mostly US aircraft .\nThe crucial Afghanistan monthly data by Air Force Central Command , or AFCENT , was stopped in March 2020 after the Trump administration agreed an effective ceasefire deal with the Taliban .\nThose public releases showed how many strikes the US and its international allies carried out in Afghanistan as well as details of weapons fired , and had been released monthly for nearly a decade beforehand .\nAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was stopping the releases due to diplomatic concerns , \u201c including how the report could adversely impact ongoing discussions with the Taliban regarding Afghanistan peace talks \u201d .\nThe newly declassified data adds credence to allegations at the time that the United States may have secretly upped its strikes in Afghanistan to put pressure on the Taliban during negotiations taking place in Qatar , with sometimes devastating impacts for civilians .\nWhile the United Nations was seemingly convinced that US strikes had largely stopped , the Taliban accused the US of violating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day.\n\u201d Those claims are now more likely to be taken seriously .\n\u201c These data tell the story of America \u2019 s struggle to end its longest war , \u201d Graeme Smith of International Crisis Group told Airwars .\nAn air war that never ended The US and the Taliban signed a so-called \u2018 peace \u2019 arrangement on February 29th 2020 .\nThis did not explicitly commit the US to a full ceasefire , but involved the Taliban effectively committing not to attack American forces in Afghanistan during a proposed 14-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed that US strikes would also significantly wind down , and be focused primarily on self-defence actions .\nYet the newly released AFCENT data shows US attacks never ceased , with 413 \u2018 international \u2019 airstrikes between March and December 2020 alone .\nFollowing the US-Taliban agreement in February 2020 , official ceasefire talks then began in Doha in September of the same year between the Taliban and the Afghan Government .\nYet in the same month , we now know , the US still secretly conducted 34 airstrikes .\nContinuing US actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah .\nThe Taliban argued that these assaults , on Afghan government forces rather than American ones , were not in breach of the agreement but the US disagreed , Smith said .\n\u201c That is why you see a sharp uptick in airstrikes from October 2020 as the Americans desperately tried to defend those provincial capitals , \u201d he said .\nAmnesty International recently highlighted what it believed was a US airstrike on Kunduz in November 2020 which killed two civilian women , Bilqiseh bint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bint Abdul Khaliq ( 25 ) , and one man , Qader Khan ( 24 ) .\nMunition fragments recovered from the scene pointed clearly to a US strike .\nIt is now clear that the United States secretly conducted 69 strikes in Afghanistan that month alone .\nSince assuming office in late January 2021 , Joe Biden initially oversaw a slight drop in strikes before a significant increase , as the 20-year US occupation ended in a chaotic and devastating withdrawal .\nIn the final desperate three months of the US presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airstrikes by US ( and possibly allied ) aircraft in a doomed bid to halt the Taliban \u2019 s lightning advance .\nMany of those actions were likely to have been close air support strikes aiding Afghan National Army forces in urban areas , who were being overrun .\nThe known risk of high civilian casualties from such actions has long been known .\nIn the chaotic last days of the war , dozens of civilians and 13 US military personnel died in an ISIS-K suicide attack as US forces barricaded themselves inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site hoping to flee the country .\nAnd in the final airstrike of the US occupation , 10 civilians were killed when American drone operators confused a father returning to his family home with an Islamic State terrorist .\nLast week , the Pentagon announced no disciplinary action would be taken in that strike .\nStopping the release of monthly airstrike data in early 2020 also appears to have convinced the United Nations that the US was no longer conducting significant attacks .\nIn both its 2020 annual report on civilian casualties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first half of 2021 , the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan ( UNAMA ) played down the impact of US and international strikes \u2013 believing them to have mostly ended .\nDuring 2020 the UN concluded , more than 3,000 Afghan civilians were killed in ongoing fighting between the Taliban and the then-Afghan government , supported by international forces .\nAccording to UNAMA , 341 civilians were killed that year by airstrikes \u2013 of which it blamed 89 deaths on international forces .\nYet UNAMA \u2019 s 2020 annual report said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US and Taliban \u201c the international military significantly reduced its aerial operations , with almost no such incidents causing civilian casualties for the remainder of 2020.\n\u201d UN officials later told Airwars during a briefing that they believed Afghan Air Force strikes were now likely responsible for almost all civilian deaths from airstrikes .\nThe release of the previously-classified data from AFCENT radically changes that picture .\nBetween March and December 2020 , Trump \u2019 s last full months in office , the US in fact carried out 413 airstrikes \u2013 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example .\nFor the first half of 2021 , UNAMA also made similar assumptions about low numbers of US and international strikes , noting that \u201c compared with the first half of 2020 , the total number of civilians killed and injured in airstrikes increased by 33 per cent .\nCivilian casualties from Afghan Air Force airstrikes more than doubled as international military forces conducted far fewer airstrikes.\n\u201d In fact , we now know , more than 370 \u2018 international \u2019 strikes were carried out in 2021 , which between them dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not immediately respond to questions on whether the UN would now be reviewing its recent findings , following the release of the AFCENT data .\nRevelations of hundreds of previously secret US airstrikes in Afghanistan during Joe Biden \u2019 s first months in office indicate that while US actions were at record lows in other theatres such as Iraq and Somalia , the intensity of the 20-year war in Afghanistan continued to the very end .\nMore than five times more US strikes were conducted in Afghanistan from January to August 2021 than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatres combined across the whole year , Airwars analysis shows .\n\u201c Airwars has been cautioning for some time that recent airstrike numbers for Afghanistan \u2013 if revealed \u2013 might show far more US military activity under Joe Biden than many had assumed , \u201d said Airwars director Chris Woods .\n\u201c This newly released data \u2013 which should never have been classified in the first place \u2013 points to the urgent need for reevaluation of recent US actions in Afghanistan , including

\u2018forever wars\u2019 look under President Biden?", "content": "Official military data shows a 54 percent decline in strikes across all US conflicts during Biden \u2019 s year in office .\nThere has been much speculation in recent weeks about what President Biden \u2019 s first year in office shows us about his foreign policy \u2013 and in particular whether he is ending 20 years of America \u2019 s so-called \u2018 forever wars \u2019 .\nAs 2021 nears its end , Airwars reached out to US combatant commands to request strike data for conflicts .\nCoupled with the long-delayed release of crucial strike data from Afghanistan , Airwars can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 war on terror \u2019 looks like under Joe Biden .\nThe biggest take-home is that Biden has significantly decreased US military action across the globe .\nIn total , declared US strikes across all five active US conflict zones \u2013 Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia , Syria and Yemen \u2013 fell from 951 actions in 2020 , to 439 by mid December 2021 , a decrease of 54 percent .\nThis is by far the lowest declared annual US strike number since at least 2004 , and reflects a broader trend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During 2021 , the overwhelming majority of US strikes ( 372 ) took place in Afghanistan prior to withdrawal on August 31st .\nIn fact , the United States carried out more than five times as many strikes in Afghanistan this year than in all other active US conflict zones combined .\nIf you were to remove Afghanistan from the data , the United States has declared just 67 strikes across the globe so far in 2021 .\nThis trend is also reflected in far lower numbers of civilians allegedly killed by US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no credible local allegations of civilians likely killed by US strikes in Iraq , Libya , Pakistan or Yemen .\nHowever , at least 11 civilians were likely killed by US actions in Syria .\nIn Afghanistan at least 10 civilians were confirmed killed by US actions .\nThat latter figure is almost certainly higher , since we now know the US dropped more than 800 munitions on Taliban and Islamic State fighters during the year .\nAt least some of those strikes were in urban areas where civilians are particularly at risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to ongoing confusion between US strikes and those carried out by Afghan security forces up to August .\nIn Somalia one civilian was locally reported killed by US strikes , though this occurred before Biden assumed office on January 20th .\nBiden is partly continuing a trend seen in recent years \u2013 the number of strikes has largely fallen since 2016 when the war with the so-called Islamic State reached its apex .\nBelow , we provide breakdowns of both US and allied airstrikes and locally reported civilian casualties \u2013 as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict .\nOn December 17th 2021 , Biden \u2019 s administration finally released strike data for the final two years of the Afghanistan war .\nSuch monthly releases were standard practice for nearly two decades but were stopped in March 2020 , with the Trump administration arguing that their ongoing release could jeopardise peace talks with the Taliban .\nThe Biden administration then chose to continue with that secrecy .\nNow we can see why .\nThe new releases show that despite a \u2018 peace \u2019 agreement with the Taliban signed on February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expected to withdraw in 14 months , the Pentagon continued its aggressive aerial campaigns in Afghanistan .\nBetween March and December 2020 , more than 400 previously undeclared strikes took place under Trump , while there were at least 300 US strikes in Afghanistan under Biden until August .\nWhile Airwars does not track allegations of civilian harm in Afghanistan , the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan ( UNAMA ) has done so for more than a decade .\nYet the decision by the Pentagon to stop publishing strike data in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to significantly underestimate casualties from US actions .\nIn its report detailing civilian casualties in Afghanistan from January to June 2021 , UNAMA found that 146 civilians had been killed and 243 injured in airstrikes .\nYet it seemed to assume these were all carried out by US-backed Afghan military forces , instead of the US .\n\u201c UNAMA\u2026did not verify any airstrike by international military forces that resulted in civilian casualties during the first six months of 2021 , \u201d the report asserted .\nSuch assessments will likely now require a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US strike data releases .\nWe do know for certain that ten civilians were killed by US actions after that six-month period , on August 29th this year in Kabul \u2013 in the final US drone strike of a 20-year war .\nThe US initially claimed this was a \u201c righteous strike \u201d on an Islamic State terrorist .\nHowever investigative journalists quickly showed the victims were in fact an aid worker and nine members of his young family , forcing the military to admit an error .\nDespite this , it recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary .\nAfter the ignominious US withdrawal on August 31 , US strikes have stopped .\nWhile at the time Biden discussed the possibility of continuing \u201c over the horizon \u201d airstrikes from a nearby country , this has not yet happened .\n\u201c The skies over Afghanistan are free of US war planes for the first time in two decades .\nA whole generation grew up under their contrails , nobody looks at the sky without checking for them , \u201d Graeme Smith of the International Crisis Group told Airwars .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new era , even if it \u2019 s not yet clear what that new chapter will bring.\n\u201d During 2020 , the number of air and artillery strikes conducted by the US-led Coalition against the Islamic State \u2013 Operation Inherent Resolve \u2013 has continued to fall , alongside an ongoing reduction in civilian harm allegations .\nOIR declared 201 air and artillery strikes in Iraq and Syria in 2020 , and only 58 strikes by early December 2021 .\nThis represents a reduction of around 70 percent in one year , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 and 2021 .\nIn Iraq , Airwars has tracked no local allegations of civilian harm from US led actions during 2021 , down from an estimated five civilian fatalities in 2020 .\nAt the height of the Coalition \u2019 s war against ISIS in 2017 , Airwars had tracked a minimum of 1,423 civilian fatalities .\nIn Syria , however , civilian harm allegations from Coalition actions actually increased this year , up from a minimum of one death in 2020 to at least eleven likely civilian fatalities in 2021 .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recent history : in 2019 , Airwars had identified a minimum of 490 civilians likely killed by the Coalition , a reduction of 98 percent to this year .\nOne key concern in Syria is that most recently reported civilian deaths have resulted not from declared US airstrikes , but from joint ground operations with Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) , often supported by US attack helicopters .\nThese include a raid on the town of Thiban in Deir Ezzor , carried out by the SDF with the support of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 .\nEyewitnesses reported that a \u201c force consisting of several cars raided civilian homes , without warning , accompanied by indiscriminate shooting between the houses with the aim of terrorising the \u2018 wanted \u2019 \u201d .\nTwo civilians , a father and son , were killed in the raid , reportedly shot outside their home .\nSeparately , on the morning of December 3rd 2021 , a declared US drone strike killed at least one man and injured at least six civilians , including up to four children from the same family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeted a motorcycle but also hit a passing car that the Qasoum family were traveling in .\nAhmed Qasoum , who was driving , described the incident ; \u201c the motorcycle was going in front of me and I decided to pass it , when I got parallel to it , I felt a lot of pressure pushing the car to the left of the road\u2026.It was horrible.\n\u201d His ten-year-old son had a fractured skull , while his 15-year-old daughter sustained a serious shrapnel injury to her head .\nOn December 6th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strike had targeted an Al-Qaeda linked militant but \u201c the initial review of the strike did indicate the potential for possible civilian casualties.\n\u201d A dashboard camera captures the moment a US strike also hits a passing civilian vehicle .\nUnder Donald Trump , there had been a record rise both in declared US airstrikes in Somalia , and in locally reported civilian deaths and injuries \u2013 with the last likely death from a US action tracked by Airwars on the final day of Trump \u2019 s presidency .\nSince then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths in Somalia under Biden .\nFor the entire year , AFRICOM has declared nine strikes so far , four of which occurred under Biden .\nWhen he came to power , his administration implemented a six-month moratorium on strikes , multiple sources said .\nThis meant that both AFRICOM and even the CIA had to have White House permission before carrying out strikes in either Somalia or Yemen .\nOn July 20th 2021 , the day the moratorium ended , AFRICOM declared the first Somali strike of the Biden era \u2013 targeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reported killed , though no civilians were among them .\nA small number of additional strikes against Al-Shabaab occurred in the weeks afterwards , the most recent of which was on August 24th .\nSince then , there have been no declared strikes .\nIn Yemen , where the US has carried out periodic strikes against alleged Al-Qaeda affiliates since 2009 , there have so far been no reliable reports of US strikes under Biden .\nIn August , Al-Qaeda itself claimed two of its fighters had been killed in a US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the date or location of this event .\nResponding to an email query from Airwars on November 18th , the US military denied carrying out any recent attacks , noting that \u201c CENTCOM conducted its last counterterror strike in Yemen on June 24 , 2019 .\nCENTCOM has not conducted any new counterterror strikes in Yemen since.\n\u201d However , in a more ambivalent statement to Airwars on December 16th , CENTCOM spokesperson Bill Urban noted only that \u201c I am not aware of any strikes in Yemen in 2021.\n\u201d Airwars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is known that the CIA carried out several airstrikes on Al Qaeda in Yemen during 2020 .\nIn both Libya and Pakistan , long running US counter terrorism campaigns now appear to be over .\nThe last locally claimed CIA strike in Pakistan was in July 2018 under President Trump , while in Libya , the last likely US strike was in October 2019 .\nBased on official US military data , it is clear that Joe Biden is building on a trend seen in the latter years of Donald Trump \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scale of the \u2018 forever wars.\n\u2019 In Iraq and Syria , US forces appear to be transitioning away from carrying out active strikes in favour of supporting allied groups \u2013 although Special Forces ground actions continue in Syria , sometimes with associated civilian harm .\nThe war in Afghanistan is now over , and it seems the long-running US campaigns in Pakistan and Libya have drawn to permanent halts .\nUS airstrikes in Somalia and Yemen have all but stopped for now .\nStill unknown is the likely framework for US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 , Biden commissioned a major review of US counter terrorism policy .\nLed by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan , the results are expected to be announced in the coming months .\nThis will likely give us a far clearer idea how Biden believes the US should fight both ongoing wars and future ones .\nAnd then there is amending \u2013 or even repealing \u2013 the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) .\nThat law , passed by Congress in the wake of 9/11 , essentially granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes anywhere in the world in the context of the \u2018 war on terror.\n\u2019 Initially designed for use against Al-Qaeda , it has been employed against an ever widening pool of US enemies .\nThe future of the 2001 AUMF is once again likely to be debated by Congress in 2022 .\nWhile unlikely to be repealed , it could possibly be significantly amended , Brian Finucane , senior advisor for the US programme at International Crisis Group , told Airwars .\n\u201c That would entail at a minimum specifying who the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy .\nSecondly identifying where it should be used \u2013 geographical limits .\nAnd thirdly giving a sunset clause , \u201d he said .\n\u201c As it is now that AUMF is basically a blank cheque to be used by different administrations .\n\u201d", "author": "Joe Dyke", "url":
