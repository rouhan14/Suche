"content": "It \u2019 s New Year \u2019 s Eve again , which means we \u2019 ll do that important dance once more , our time-honoured tradition of looking back at the most important , most unusual , and dare we say conspiratorial events of the previous year .\nIt \u2019 s been said that 2020 wasn \u2019 t so much a year to be experienced , so much as it was a year to be endured .\nLast year we said that \u201c if 2019 taught us anything , it \u2019 s that conspiracies are real.\n\u201d This year we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 has taught us anything , it \u2019 s that the so-called \u2018 conspiracy theorists \u2019 were right all along .\nWe realize that must be a really bitter red pill to swallow for many a mainstream media maven , who for years have tried to fashion careers out of deriding and persecuting anyone who defied the official narrative , labeling them as dangerous \u2018 conspiracy theorists \u2019 and purveyors of \u2018 disinformation.\n\u2019 Hence , the new paradigm going forward shall be : There were a number of honorable mentions this past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to break into the top ten , but sadly no chance this time\u2026 The trial in the Netherlands of the downing of Flight MH17 began in March and was threatening to unhinged a major lynch-pin story used by NATO members states in order to demonize , isolate and geopolitically contain Russia .\nBefore hearings really got off the ground , they were delayed \u2013 as nearly all of Europe began headed into \u2018 pandemic \u2019 lockdowns .\nAnother casualty of COVID it seemed .\nCourt proceedings have since resumed , and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s main sacred cow of official anti-Russian fake news , so watch this space .\nAnother saga which bled into 2020 was of course the Jeffrey Epstein affair .\nBack in August 2019 , the notorious sex trafficker and friend to the rich and famous , succumbed \u201c suicide by hanging \u201d in his cell just before he was due to testify and give evidence .\nBut the VIPs were still on the hook , including British royal Prince Andrew , but more importantly Epstein \u2019 s partner-in-crime , Ghislaine Maxwell , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied $ 28.5 million bail request as she awaits court proceedings .\nOther high-profile Epstein co-conspirators were arrested too , including former French modelling agency procurer Jean-Luc Brunel , but where this story will lead is still murky .\nDuring the 2020 Democrat Primaries , the first glimpse of high-tech election fraud emerged during the Iowa Caucuses \u2013 after the party insiders managed to funnel all of the votes through a dodgy digital election App which allowed spook-spoiler candidate Pete Buttigieg to come from behind and steal victory from the front-runner Bernie Sanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scam was Joe Biden himself , then struggling to keep up with the voters \u2019 favorites at the time .\nNot surprisingly , Silicon Valley billionaires were behind this effort , which really foreshadowed the historic capers to follow in November .\nIn terms of the outright bizarre and unusual , there is the mysterious Kubrick-style Monoliths which suddenly appeared in a number exotic locations , first in the high deserts of Utah , and then in England \u2019 s Isle of Wight , and numerous others .\nAnd just like in 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed up in droves ( only this time taking selfies ) .\nWith that in mind , here are the absolute show-stoppers of 2020\u2026 10 .\nThe Death of Russiagate \u2013 At long last , one of the longest-running officially-sanctioned conspiracy theories was laid to rest in 2020 .\nThe year 2019 saw to complete collapse of the circus-like Mueller Investigation , a $ 30 million effort which produced no evidence of any alleged \u2018 Russian Collusion \u2019 with the Trump campaign .\nThis plot was officially closed out after a memo surfaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Trump was elected in 2016 , Hillary Clinton herself floated the idea of creating a Russian hoax in order to deflect away from her own scandals during her disastrous election effort .\nYou could say Trump was justified in calling CNN , MSNBC et al , \u201c the fake news media , \u201d because all of it was fake .\nIncredibly , the Media and Democrats are now trying to quietly tip-toe away from the issue and pretend they weren \u2019 t all harping on it for the last four years .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been politically targeted by the FBI , including Michael Flynn , Roger Stone , Paul Manafort and George Papadopoulos .\nDespite all of this , Democrats and Biden are still dipping into the Russiagate punch bowl , trying to scapegoat The Russians !\n\u2122 after Joe \u2019 s son Hunter left his laptop in a computer repair shop with a reams of incriminating evidence on it .\n\u201c This story isn \u2019 t real , it \u2019 s Russian disinformation !\n\u201d they still cried in 2020 .\nOld habits die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kosher Encounters of Third Kind \u2013 We know what you \u2019 re thinking , but don \u2019 t laugh , this really happened .\nAll bets were off after a retired Israeli general went public saying that an alien confab known as the \u201c Galactic Federation \u201d have been in contact with US and Israeli top brass for years , but are keeping low profile to prevent hysteria among humanity .\nIndeed , intergalactic whistleblower retired General Haim Eshed intimated it \u2019 s because \u201c humanity isn \u2019 t ready \u201d ( mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on face value , then that last bit is somewhat plausible considering how utterly irrational and insane everyone has become during the \u2018 pandemic \u2019 in 2020 ) .\nYou may laugh , but this story about Tel Aviv \u2019 s ET hotline ran in most mainstream media outlets , so it \u2019 s hardly coming from the internet fringe .\nIn a roundabout way , you could say this was a belated PR fodder after Israel \u2019 s privately-funded \u201c Beresheet \u201d unmanned spacecraft crashed into the lunar surface in 2019 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eshed \u2019 s story was also read as a tacit nod towards another long-running popular conspiracy known as Project Blue Beam , which describes an above top-secret plan to stage a fake alien arrival using holographic wizardry .\nEngineered by global powers , Blue Beam is said to be designed to bamboozle the masses with what will ultimately be unmasked as the Anti-Christ .\nEshed \u2019 s wild story did trigger a QAnon-UFO venn diagram overlap of followers , after the Israeli general said that Trump was \u2018 in the loop \u2019 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lent additional credence by the President \u2019 s earlier announcement of creation of the Space Force as the fifth branch of the US armed forces .\nYes , it \u2019 s bizarre and quite likely far-fetched , but who can really wave the finger of normalism at anything in 2020 ?\nCombine this with the Monolith story and you \u2019 ve definitely reinvigorated the UFO community .\nAs Hunter S. Thompson once famously said , \u201c When the going gets weird , the weird turn pro.\n\u201d Now , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with confidence on that little gonzo ditty .\n8 .\nBREXIT ( without the exit ) \u2013 Right before the new year was due to ring-in , Boris Johnson miraculously managed to pull-off that oven-ready turkey he \u2019 d been basting for the last 18 months , known affectionately as the \u201c Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community \u201d and its subset , the \u201c EU\u2013UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement \u201d , colloquially known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 the Deal or No Deal , the fear-mongering , and diplomatic warfare not only between Westminster and Brussels , but an internecine war between British politicos \u2013 what exactly did Britain achieve ?\nExactly how much are they \u2018 out \u2019 of the EU ?\nAfter his Christmas caper , Boris Johnson said , \u201c We have taken back control of our laws and our destiny.\n\u201d Is this really about \u201c Global Britain \u201c , or is it a glorious return of the British Commonwealth ?\nCritics have pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most EU institutions , laws and conventions , and while the Tory government may claim this was a victory for UK sovereignty , Johnson has quietly tied Britain into the highly unpopular transnational corporate takeover known as the TPP ( Transpacific Partnership ) , and who knows , possibly into some form of the TTIP ( Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) by fiat at a later date .\nSo this story has only just begun , and the real motives for BREXIT may emerge soon enough .\n7 .\nThe George Floyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of events unfold , following the death in custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis , Minnesota .\nThe death was caught on video , and erupted on social media , leading to cascading \u201c Black Lives Matter \u201d ( BLM ) protests and rioting across the country .\nFloyd became a global media phenomenon and martyr overnight .\nThis came at a time when much of America was under a Coronavirus lockdown , and many were wearing masks \u2013 which certainly didn \u2019 t help police in their effort to arrest scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really ask the question : was America \u2019 s latest wave of \u2018 anti-racism \u2019 protests really about racial equality , or is there a deeper political agenda at play ?\nClearly , this seemed to be case of police brutality , but was the killing of George Floyd really racially motivated , or was there another more empirical explanation ?\nAs it happens , state prosecutors filed no hate crime charges for the trial of officer Derek Chauvin and the other officers , presumably because there was no evidence that Floyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way .\nIn fact , numerous studies have been conducted which have disproven the popular media claim that white police officers are bias in shooting African-Americans in America .\nThe numbers simply to not add up to support the BLM narrative .\nThe protests were far from peaceful , and were in fact based on a false , politicized soundbite premise .\nIn a nutshell , that \u2019 s 2020 flash mob politics .\n6 .\nThe Assassination of Soleimani \u2013 The new year had hardly rung-in before the US announced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTo justify this act , US officials claimed to have had \u201c intelligence \u201d ( likely from Israel ) that the US embassy protest in Iraq was somehow organized by Washington \u2019 s newest premier villain , Iranian Quds Force leader Soleimani .\nLater , in the early hours of Friday January 3 , 2020 , the US government launched a drone attack outside Baghdad International Airport which assassinated Soleimani , along with senior Iraqi PMU commander , Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis .\nAgain , it is likely that Israel prompted the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Tehran and others as a blatant act of war by the Trump Administration .\nAs it turns out , two Israeli loyalists \u2013 John Bolton and Mike Pompeo , for months had both been pushing Trump to attack Iran following the highly embarrassing downing of a US drone by the Iranian air defenses back in June 2019 .\nWhat happened next would shock the hawks in Washington and alter US policy forever in the region : on January 8th , Iran launched a retaliatory missile strike which destroyed two US bases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powerful , and sent political shockwaves through Washington .\nLater , the Pentagon would admit that at least 50 US service members suffered head injuries after missile strikes .\nIt \u2019 s still a mystery how they were injured and whether the number was even higher \u2013 and included fatalities which the US were too embarrassed to admit .\nThat \u2019 s likely classified , because more than anything , this standoff is about optics as much as it is about firepower .\nThe irony for Washington is that this series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position in the region , and beyond .\n5 .\nThe Persecution of Julian Assange \u2013 After the apprehension of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy by the British Security in April 2019 , he was then into the notorious Supermax Belmarsh Prison in southeast London .\nSoon after , 18-count superseding indictments for espionage and \u2018 hacking \u2019 were filed by the US government .\nBy then , a slow but steady global movement began building to raise awareness of his plight and demand his freedom .\nThis full-frontal attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unprecedented , with the British Courts , led by hawkish judge Vanessa Baraitser , made it clear that their intention was to deny Assange all of his legal rights by keeping him incarcerated on a decade-old spurious and now defunct bail-skipping charge , and denying him proper access to to his defense team .\nBaraitser and the British Establishment seemed intent on pushing Assange through the rigged US extradition process , and to hell with the legal ramifications of this historic abrogation of basic rights enshrined in Western democracy .\nNo sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring of 2020 , that everything was delayed \u2013 because of the pandemic .\nThis also conveniently curtailed the international protest movement in support of Assange too .\nThat \u2019 s right \u2013 COVID is the gift that just keeps on giving ( to the Establishment ) .\nA decision will will rendered by the British High Court in just a few days time , on Jan 4 , 2021 .\nWhich way will it go ?\nWill Baraitser return a verdict of extradition , or freedom ?\nMillions around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nVaccinating the World \u2013 One of the most insidious byproducts of the COVID-19 \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 crisis has been the break-neck rush to produce and distribute a vaccine .\nNormally , the process of testing and approving a vaccine takes between 4 and 10 years , but because of the mass hysteria surrounding COVID , government have waved normal safety protocols in an effort to fast-track the vaccines in what they are calling \u201c Operation Warp Speed.\n\u201d The title in itself is frightening enough , as it seems to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speed of delivery .\nThis was the clarion call from day one , with global magnate Bill Gates on nearly every major global media outlet imaginable promoting his new plan to \u201c vaccinate the world \u201d \u2013 all to supposedly protect humanity with synthetic immunity from the dreaded \u2018 novel \u2019 Coronavirus .\nHe then fronted billions of his foundation \u2019 s cash to kick-start this operation to jab 8 billion souls .\nAccording to Bill and his elite establishment cohort , \u201c life can only return to normal with the vaccine.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask the simple question : why does everyone suddenly need to be vaccinated when , statistically speaking , the only demographic which was badly effected by COVID were elderly people with multiple long-term chronic health conditions ?\nWorse yet , this new \u2018 miracle \u2019 vaccine in question isn \u2019 t your average dangerous cocktails squalene , thimerosal , aluminium and mercury .\nNo , this is a new experimental mRNA vaccine which despite what Big Pharma and Big Media claim \u2013 has no long-term testing for safety and efficacy .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot in the dark .\nThrough this corporate power-play , we are now beginning to see the rapid emergence of a new Pandemic Industrial Complex .\nAs far as Gates is concerned , critics have hinted he may have ulterior motives , not least of all his own family \u2019 s long standing commitment to global population reduction .\nNaturally , this unusual confluence of events and interests have set the global conspiratorium ablaze .\nAnd with good reason \u2013 here you have one of the richest men with a global saviour complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupled with an extremist ideological worldview , now personally bankrolling a potentially dangerous mass-pharmaceutical intervention , and using his fortune to dictate planetary public health policy to governments and the World Health Organization ( which he also funds ) .\nWhat could possible go wrong ?\n3 .\nThe Stealing of the 2020 Election \u2013 Not only was 2020 the strangest of years , every event contained within it was the strangest of its political phenotype .\nThe US 2020 Presidential Election between Republican incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed it\u2026 .\nCOVID .\nAlarm bells went off in May and June when Democrats began pushing for \u201c universal mail-in ballots \u201d \u2013 totally unprecedented in US history , and for obvious reason .\nDemocrats insisted that \u201c it \u2019 s no longer safe for Americans to vote at the polls , because of the virus.\n\u201d Through this strategy , and by filing no less than 300 lawsuits in multiple states , Democratic Party operative were able to overturn election laws , extending mail-in voting deadlines , and even removing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signature verifications .\nIncredible , no ?\nIn fact , unsolicited postal ballots have always been regarded as an invitation for mass voter fraud .\nThis set the stage for the \u201c miracle comeback \u201d that would transpire on election night .\nBizarrely , Biden hardly campaigned throughout the summer and fall , not until the last two weeks before election day in November .\nHis rallies had dozens , rather than thousands .\nMeanwhile , Trump was filling up stadiums as he barnstormed across the country , often hitting three states in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump went into midnight with a commanding lead , but then something strange happened .\nUS media outlets were reluctant to \u201c call \u201d an state wins for Trump , and instead announced after midnight that \u201c the vote counting has stopped \u201d \u2013 not just in one state , but in at least eight states , simultaneously .\nThen America went to bed , and when they woke up the media were now reporting a miraculous comeback by Joe Biden which supposedly happened around 4am after millions of votes appeared in counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden needed to win in order to oust Trump .\nWho knew ?\nTo add more tinder to the conspiracy fire , at 78 , Biden is suffering from visible Senator Josh Hawley ( R-MO ) has announced he will object when Congress convenes to certify the electoral college vote \u2013 the final step in confirming election results and preparing for Biden \u2019 s inauguration on January 20th .\nIs this stand-off nearly over , or is it only getting started ?\nWill this grudge match spill into the streets ?\nWe \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only was 2020 the strangest of years , every event contained within it was the strangest of its political phenotype .\nThe US 2020 Presidential Election between Republican incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden was no exception .\nBehind the chicanery : you guessed it\u2026 .\nCOVID .\nAlarm bells went off in May and June when Democrats began pushing for \u201c universal mail-in ballots \u201d \u2013 totally unprecedented in US history , and for obvious reason .\nDemocrats insisted that \u201c it \u2019 s no longer safe for Americans to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus.\n\u201d Through this strategy , and by filing no less than 300 lawsuits in multiple states , Democratic Party operative were able to overturn election laws , extending mail-in voting deadlines , and even removing the ballot harvesting safety checks such as ballot signature verifications .\nIncredible , no ?\nIn fact , unsolicited postal ballots have always been regarded as an invitation for mass voter fraud .\nThis set the stage for the \u201c miracle comeback \u201d that would transpire on election night .\nBizarrely , Biden hardly campaigned throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two weeks before election day in November .\nHis rallies had dozens , rather than thousands .\nMeanwhile , Trump was filling up stadiums as he barnstormed across the country , often hitting three states in one day .\nOn election night , Trump went into midnight with a commanding lead , but then something strange happened .\nUS media outlets were reluctant to \u201c call \u201d an state wins for Trump , and instead announced after midnight that \u201c the vote counting has stopped \u201d \u2013 not just in one state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simultaneously .\nThen America went to bed , and when they woke up the media were now reporting a miraculous comeback by Joe Biden which supposedly happened around 4am after millions of votes appeared in counting stations in the very key swing states Biden needed to win in order to oust Trump .\nWho knew ?\nTo add more tinder to the conspiracy fire , at 78 , Biden is suffering from visible cognitive decline , and is not expected to last a year or two in the job , meaning he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left-wing ( and highly unpopular ) Vice President Kamala Harris .\nIn the election data post-mortem , the data and statistical anomalies were too many to count , some of which was detailed in a recent US Senate Hearing on election fraud .\nBut despite copious amounts evidence and sworn witness testimonies , the mainstream and Big Tech firms like Google , Twitter and Facebook jointly erected an information firewall ( one that would make China blush ) to censor and suppress any information or dissenting opinion to the Democrat Party \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not there was any foul play in the 2020 election .\nThis was unprecedented and prompted Senate hearings looking at Big Tech election meddling and abuses of their monopoly power .\nIn just a few days from now , two major events will take place : the double US Senate run-off election on January 5th which will decide who controls the US Senate ( a result which could permanently change the political structure of the US going forward ) , followed a potential final challenge to November \u2019 s election results by President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington DC .\nAlready , 2 .\nThe Global Pandemic \u2013 What can be said about the COVID-19 \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 that hasn \u2019 t already been said .\nWhat began exactly 12 months ago in Wuhan , China , has since made it \u2019 s way around the globe , and while hardly the most lethal or deadly pathogen in history , it \u2019 s certainly the one with the biggest political and economic gravy train in tow .\nIt changed the world overnight , sort of .\nWell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel \u2019 Coronavirus that brought heaven and earth to a screeching halt , but rather Governments \u2019 coordinated mass-panic and draconian lockdown policies \u2013 effectively shutting down whole sections of economies , forced closures of businesses , schools , locking most people up in their own homes , along with endless over-blown fear stories about how COVID is spreading \u2013 even on cash and Amazon parcels .\nThese reports turned out to be false , but the fear remained .\nGovernments are still having to pay-out for lost wages , and subsidizing corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankrupting the public purse in the process .\nAs a result , tens of millions are being needlessly added to the unemployment rolls every month .\nTrillions are literally being wasted for no reason other than to constantly reinflate a bubble of mass-hysteria and fear .\nInitially , some countries like Sweden look the sane route and thus managed to avoid the suicidal policies of the UK , Spain , Italy and others , but in the end , even the Swedes were bullied to lockdown this winter .\nIf there was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last March , but the idea of it has been continually resuscitated and brought back to life as a hollow \u201c casedemic.\n\u201d Governments keep touting \u201c cases \u201d but can \u2019 t show any serious illness hospitalizations or deaths to correlate with their infinite mountain of \u201c cases.\n\u201d Why ?\nAs it turns out , and as any remaining sane individual will tell you , all of the novel emergency \u2018 pandemic \u2019 New Normal police state measures \u2013 social distancing , lockdowns , mandatory masks , mass testing , contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Zoom \u2013 are all built upon two fraudulent premises , the first being the fraudulent use of the PCR Test which could conceivably give anyone ( or anything ) a positive test result , instantly making them a \u201c case \u201d according to the state \u2013 even if they have no real viral infection .\nSecond , is the widely held assumption that everyone is a potential vector of the disease , aka the myth of the \u201c asymptomatic spreader \u201c .\nBoth of these two fatal flaws and are what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endless crisis \u2013 with no end in sight .\nDuring this last year , the Government have partnered with Media and the Pharmaceutical-Medical Industrial Complex with a relentless propaganda campaign that \u2019 s determine to keep the public in fear and compliance for as long as possible .\n\u201c Our hospitals are being overrun !\n\u201d is the weekly Orwellian mantra , meanwhile all of the public can see are empty hospitals and dancing nurses on TikTok .\nIn the end , Project Fear has successfully turned hundreds of millions of formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWill people come to their senses and reject the contrived consensus-reality narrative in 2021 , or will they continue to defer to the \u2018 power of the virus \u2019 ?\nHumanity is at a real crossroads .\n1 .\nThe Great Reset \u2013 While COVID and the idea of the \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 is really number one in terms of conspiracies of 2020 ( and likely of all time ) , what lays beyond it could really be the progenitor of the conspiracy itself , which is something called \u201c that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed the world , forcing societies to re-order and re-engineer life on earth as we once knew it .\nBut it is not the virus which that , it \u2019 s just government , and the WEF , the WHO and their cheering section in the Media and Silicon Valley .\nTogether , they form the globalists \u2019 syndicate .\nAccording the WEF , this new global order is the gateway to their Fourth Industrial Revolution \u2013 a new gilded age of robotics , where humans will be largely surplus to requirement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new class of UBI proletariat \u2013 up to futurist musings and TED-inspired mindscaping of Schwab and his elite Sanhedrin of technocrats and Big Tech gurus .\nMoney will be replaced by a new digital \u201c nature-backed \u201d currency which will be used to put a price on every move you make as it related to your carbon footprint .\nIt \u2019 s a level of authoritarian technocracy never before seen in the history of mankind , and with some very uncomfortable transhumanism proclivities according to WEF \u2019 s new cultural clerics .\nNaturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is Joe Biden , Boris Johnson , Canada \u2019 s Justin Trudeau , Germany \u2019 s Angela Merkel , former Bank of England head Mark Carney , along with Tony Blair , Prince Charles , Bono , and Greta Thunberg \u2013 they \u2019 re are all onboard with this new global \u201c Build Back Better \u201d crypto-communist ( run by corporate monopolists ) Brave New World .\nBut according to coincidence theorists in the mainstream media , lieutenants , a New World Order must be fast-tracked , including a global Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ( according to Schwab in the future \u2018 reset \u2019 world we must only rent things , not own them ) , in order to \u201c save humanity from imminent extinction.\n\u201d Low and behold , COVID-19 is what is magically \u201c providing the people of the world the opportunity to make the Great Reset a reality now.\n\u201d What a coincidence .\nThroughout the 2020 pandemic , how many times have you heard some talking head say , \u201c Things will never be the same again \u201d \u2013 a line they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians alike .\nAt the core of this neurolinguistics reframing operation is the dubious premisethat it \u2019 s the virus which has transformed the world , forcing societies to re-order and re-engineer life on earth as we once knew it .\nBut it is not the virus which that , it \u2019 s just government , and the WEF , the WHO and their cheering section in the Media and Silicon Valley .\nTogether , they form the globalists \u2019 syndicate .\nAccording the WEF , this new global order is the gateway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new gilded age of robotics , where humans will be largely surplus to requirement , leaving the ultimate fate of this giant new class of UBI proletariat \u2013 up to futurist musings and TED-inspired mindscaping of Schwab and his elite Sanhedrin of

conspiracies of 2020 ( and likely of all time ) , what lays beyond it could really be the progenitor of the conspiracy itself , which is something called \u201c The Great Reset \u201c .\nIt is a

21WIRE", "date": "2021-01-02", "source": "21stcenturywire", "title": "INTO THE FIRE: 2021 Trends and Predictions from 21WIRE", "content": "Looking forward into the New Year , here are but a few salient predictions breaking trends to look out for the coming year .\nIn last year \u2019 s Trends and Predictions for 2020 , we identified a number of important moves in the political , geopolitical , and financial worlds , but some of these ended up being affected in one way or another by the emergence of an epic black swan \u2013 \u2018 the pandemic \u2019 \u2013 which took the world by storm in February and March .\nThe COVID crisis certainly created a speed bump for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s economic success and certain re-election , and also the surging global protest movement \u2013 both of which were gaining momentum in late 2019 .\nSome will argue this was more than a mere coincidence , but we \u2019 ll leave that one for the Conspiracy Realists .\nAs we now know , \u2018 the pandemic \u2019 has opened up a whole new Pandora \u2019 s box of possibilities going forward , joyously referred as the New Normal .\nPresently , all the indicators are showing that 2021 will be a continuation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more new and strange realities will come to the fore , as the new year takes us \u2018 out of the frying pan \u2019 and into the fire \u2013 of what is looking increasingly like an embryonic brave new world .\nSo here is some of the good , the bad , but mostly ugly for 2021\u2026 The Great Pestilence Part 2 \u2013 If you believe in the predictions made by the French philosopher Michel de Nostradamus , then you can expect no less than world-ending asteroids , a zombies apocalypse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16th century seer for 2021 .\nIt seems that at least one of those \u2013 the pestilence \u2013 is set to continue .\nWhile China appears to be getting on with life ( even at the former epicenter of \u2018 the pandemic \u2019 in Wuhan ) , Lockdown-loving governments in the West seem keen to continue the controlled demolition of their economies and societies , with public health ministers making-up ever new bio plot-lines to extend their \u201c state of emergency \u201d into the new year .\nPandemic mavens in the UK and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fast-fading \u2018 novel \u2019 coronavirus \u2013 by launching endless \u201c new variants , \u201d or mutations of the virus , which they claimed is 70 % more transmissible that the original Rona .\nThese fanciful pseudo-science tales were quickly debunked by leading microbiologists pointed out that this was actually fake news being spun-up by desperate government science hacks .\nStill , politicians are running with their colorful new talking points , in what can only be described as a tripling-down effort to save face and keep their New Normal agenda rolling .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u2018 mutant strains \u2019 , along with various and sundry other \u2018 biological threats \u2019 in 2021 .\nEven Bill Gates and WHO director Dr Mike Ryan have foretold that \u201c we must be ready for the next one \u201d \u2013 which they promise will be \u201c bigger than this one.\n\u201d Oh really ?\nThe \u2018 New Normal \u2019 Persists \u2013 Despite all of the problems with the official \u2018 pandemic \u2019 narrative \u2013 the fraudulent PCR Testing data , the myth of the \u2018 asymptomatic spreader \u2018 , the inflated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing masks \u2013 the majority of the population in the West have unfortunately been acclimatized to the new pandemic-culture , or New Normal .\nRegardless of any real science and evidence which upends the hysteria of 2020 , Governments , politicians , and corporations are not likely to change their course .\nThey are firmly locked-in and committed to further pandemonium , indefinitely .\nThe reason is simple : Governments do not want to relinquish their newfound authoritarian superpowers over the feeble electorate .\nThat means continued crazed calls for more social distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses , schools , churches , and more pointless non-science-based lockdowns .\nAnd all the while , still claiming that \u201c we \u2019 ll all be free once we \u2019 re all vaccinated.\n\u201d It \u2019 s now reached a level of institutional madness .\nEven if they wanted to reverse course , they can not , because this would violate the First Commandment of 21st century politics : \u201c Thou shalt never admit you cocked-up and got it totally wrong.\n\u201d If they ever admitted they were totally wrong , that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careers as parasites of the public purse .\nSo they are going to double-down on the all of the nonsensical , economy-killing policies .\nThis level of corruption is unlike anything we \u2019 ve ever seen before in history .\nWorse yet , these buffoons will have no choice but to fall back on another pseudo-science train wreck : conflating COVID with climate change , and driving western societies towards a half-baked \u2018 Green New Deal \u2018 and a new world order underpinned by the globalists \u2019 famed Great Reset .\nOn so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster of biblical proportions .\nAre there any adults left in the room ?\nPoverty and Food Shortages \u2013 One of the predictable outcomes of the Western governments \u2019 hysterical COVID-based social distancing and \u201c PPE hell \u2019 , and financially suicidal lockdown policies \u2013 has been chaotic supply chains and the failure of many food producers and distributors .\nThis economic ecosystem is already fragile in good times , and requires a degree stability across borders and markets .\nSo it \u2019 s no surprise that many food supply lines are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortages , and if the madness continues , it may lead to famine in certain areas of the globe .\nOf course , this could be solved immediately , if Governments would drop the false pretense of the \u201c global pandemic \u201d , but as we \u2019 ve point out already , the political economy is now too invested into this narrative to reverse course .\nThis may spell disaster for those in more vulnerable economic zones .\nNot to mention the massive increase in the overall wealth and poverty gap \u2013 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies , and the hypochondria-inspired , crippling PPE requirements imposed by clueless government agencies \u2013 but which have also become a massive profit center for the usual opportunistic vultures .\nIf fears of famine actually come to fruition , expect corrupt politicians and their loyal scribes in the Mainstream Media to blame \u201c the virus \u201d for a disaster which they themselves created by imposing irrational , ill-thought-out policies .\nIt \u2019 s nothing short of biblical , and may spell the end to western civilization as we once knew it .\n\u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublime magic move by Trump this month , it looks like Joe Biden will be sworn in as President on January 20th .\nAccording to most polls , about half the country do not recognize him as the legitimate winner of the November election , and for good reason .\nHence , he will likely go down in history as another \u2018 Shoeless Joe \u2018 in American lore .\nThat means that from Day One , there will be a passionate and vocal opposition to a Biden Presidency .\nExpect the Media to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least the first 12 months , with zero criticism , even if he \u2019 s obviously out to lunch .\nIt certainly doesn \u2019 t help that at 78 years old \u2013 not exactly in his prime , and obviously lacking the drive and energy required to lead a country like the United States .\nIt \u2019 s been pointed out how he is suffering from a very visible cognitive decline .\nAlready as \u201c President Elect \u2019 he is slurring his speech while reading off the teleprompter , with some critics pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know or understand half of what is being written for him .\nAlso , at his age , he may suffer a serious health challenge \u2013 maybe even from COVID ( which the Media would make an endless meal out of , and use Biden to hammer-home even more \u2018 pandemic \u2019 crisis regulations ) .\nAdd to this Biden \u2019 s natural proclivity to drop gaffes , say stupid and offensive things , and lose his temper when asked a direct question by the press .\nIf the DOJ advances it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s foreign pay-to-play grift and money laundering activities , as well as Joe \u2019 s own corruption in Ukraine and profiting off of a Chinese financial holding company \u2013 then the heat will be on , and it \u2019 s unlikely he will handle any of it gracefully .\nThe conflation of these two problems may lead to him becoming a national embarrassment for his party and the country in 2021 , so much so that even stalwart Democrats will begin the Chinese whisper ( no pun intended ) campaign saying \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down.\n\u201d \u2018 President \u2019 Harris \u2013 With Biden already struggling to deliver canned speeches , it \u2019 s increasingly likely that his departure will be sooner rather than later \u2013 maybe even within the first 18 months .\nThis leads us to the inevitable changing of the guard for the Democrats .\nBiden has already fumbled and called her \u201c President Harris \u201d on multiple occasions .\nMost smart pundits could see that Joe was only a \u2018 placeholder \u2019 and that the plan has always been to shuffle him out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical leftist junior senator from California , Vice President-elect Kamala Harris .\nBiden has even admitted publicly that he only chose her because she was a women , and not because she was qualified ( less than one term as a US Senator ) : during the 2020 Democratic Primaries , Harris was polling at around 1 % and was forced to drop out before the first state primary , showing what little real support she has from the American people .\nIf Biden is bundled off stage , the Media will laud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d as she will be \u2018 a woman of color \u2019 as \u201c the first woman President \u201d , but an unelected one , and damaged goods from a dodgy Biden win .\nHowever , the Establishment likes her because she has remained hawkish on pushing the fake Russiagate narrative , she \u2019 s a loyal friend of Israel , and will press ahead promoting identity politics and the culture wars with more race and gender division , and of course , pushing mandatory masks and promoting \u2018 the pandemic.\n\u2019 She ticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that respect .\nThe only problem is , she will never have a mandate with the American people , and therefore will not be able to \u201c unify the country.\n\u201d Expect serious opposition to this DNC Trojan horse , and in response , she may activate the radical leftist street mobs which she openly encouraged in 2020 .\nBLM Riots \u2013 Under a Biden or Harris administration , you can be sure that the proto-Marxist political organization known as Black Lives Matter ( BLM ) will become more emboldened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some African-America man is shot and killed by a policeman somewhere in America , then it will almost certainly result in nationwide mass rioting and looting like we saw this past summer post-George Floyd .\nThe likelihood of more flash mobs is also being fueled by the Government \u2019 s own efforts in destroying the economy over of COVID and creating more unemployed youth in the process .\nNaturally , these kids with put on their fashionable pandemic masks and get out on the streets .\nThis is already become a permanent state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon , where their is a permanent Antifa bloc on the streets , ready on-command to be fired-up ( no pun intended ) by radical ideologies like Kamala Harris , and the growing legion of identity politics merchants in Washington and the Media .\nAgain , it \u2019 s all really great for MSM ratings .\nHillary Clinton \u2013 If Kamala Harris is installed in the White House , then it \u2019 s possible that the Democratic establishment will import the real power-broker as her Vice President .\nAny shortlist of candidates will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the Clintons could be back in the White House , and most certainly a ruthless cabal along with them .\nOther candidates could be John Kerry , or globalist technocrat Susan Rice .\nThe left would certainly relish an \u201c all woman \u201d duo in the White House , possibly too irresistible to pass up .\nMind you , if it \u2019 s Hillary who gets the VP call , then she \u2019 ll be one step ( or one scandal ) away from the Presidency .\nExpect her to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on though , possibly as UN Ambassador .\nReturn of \u2018 Humanitarian Interventions \u2019 \u2013 Joe Biden already signaled in his speeches that \u201c America is Back \u201d , and that he \u201c won \u2019 t shy away \u201d from getting involved in the sort of endless R2P operations , color revolutions and proxy wars that defined the Obama years .\nThis is how the Democrats like to roll , a slightly different approach than the more bombastic Neocon style of starting overseas wars .\nWith R2P fanatics like Samantha Power and Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see more \u201c save the children \u201d and \u201c reestablish democracy \u201d rhetoric as the precursor for military and NGO deployments by Washington , as it moves to \u201c reengage \u201d with the world .\nSahel Region \u2013 One possible new area of \u201c engagement \u201d by Washington may be the Sahel Region in Africa , Sudan , and Ethiopia .\nControlling the all-important Horn of Africa and evicting Chinese influence from that region will be a top priority for geopolitical hawks in Washington and Europe too , so expect things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw-in a Western diplomatic , and a later joint US-NATO or EU military intervention to quell some \u201c humanitarian disaster \u201d or oust some despotic warlord , or even a cameo appearance by ISIS .\nWhatever the pretext , just know that the West is desperate to gain control of this part of Africa to compliment their near successful north-south partitioning of Yemen .\nVaccine Apartheid \u2013 Here \u2019 s one trend which will be rather unpleasant .\nEven before the COVID-19 folly began , Western politicians , mainstream media , and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeptics , including anyone with legitimate questions , as \u201c Anti-Vaxxers \u201d .\nThis pejorative label was designed by the Establishment to marginalize and persecute anyone who dared to challenge the nearly infallible pharmaceutical gospel currently being preached 24/7 .\nHowever , this demonization effort has backfired somewhat , as many people realized this preemptive attack was being ramped up in advance of the crisis , as seen with Boris Johnson \u2019 s September 2019 speech at the United Nations .\nThere is almost an obsession now with government and media when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being made about the new jab \u2019 s effectiveness , to chorus of screams that \u201c only with the vaccine can we reclaim our old lives.\n\u201d The Big Pharma hype is so over-the-top now , it \u2019 s gone beyond bizarre .\nCritics have also exposed the strange rush to push these new experimental mRNA vaccine cocktails into the public domain \u2013 bypassing the 4 to 10 year period of required research , crucial safety and efficacy testing \u2013 all because we \u2019 ve been told \u201c we can \u2019 t wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to save us from the pandemic.\n\u201d The Establishment have now backpedaled , no longer using the derogatory term Anti-Vaxxer , with Government psychologists inventing what they feel is a more persuasive term , called \u201c vaccine hesitancy.\n\u201d All of this may be leading to a type of \u2018 vaccine apartheid \u2019 \u2013 where the State and its corporation agents will attempt to separate populations by the vaccinated and the unvaccinated , likely through new Orwellian programs like \u201c immunity passports \u201d or \u201c risk-free certificates \u201d .\nOf course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID \u2018 miracle \u2019 vaccine does not even provide immunity to COVID , it only \u201c reduces symptoms \u201d according to pharma executives .\nWhat could possible go wrong ?\nThe New Boogeyman is China \u2013 Move over Russia , your days of being Washington \u2019 s No.1 nemesis are now over .\nUS intelligence officials and the think-tankery are all in agreement that China is the \u201c greatest threat to democracy and freedom \u201d since World War Two .\nLike it or not , this is the new Washington consensus .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry this new torch forward .\nUS Intel Chief John Ratcliffe warned how China is achieving its power by \u2018 stealing US secrets \u2019 and then replacing US firms in the market .\nThe Trump administration took a hard line on China , imposing tariffs on Chinese imports .\nPentagon gurus are warning of Chinese threats , from espionage , to exotic EMPs , and \u201c crippling cyber attacks.\n\u201d This will be especially useful for Washington to cover-up its own massive failings and self-harming COVID policies .\nIndeed , the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China has not yet responded in kind .\nNaturally , many in US will continue blaming China for releasing \u2018 the virus \u2019 and ruining the West ( when in fact it was the West \u2019 s ridiculous lockdowns and other lame COVID policies which caused every problem they \u2019 re experiencing right now ) .\nThis may escalate gradually into a new cold war lasting for years \u2013 because the US can not survive politically without a global adversary .\nNothing personal to Xi & Co. , but it \u2019 s just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without a major adversary , half of the defense industry would collapse , and thousands of lobbyists would be out of work and on UBI .\nThe next phase will be a new Red Scare \u2013 where US media and political operatives will be stoking fear of Chinese spies in every US institution and corporation , and calling for a \u201c purge \u201d on national security grounds .\nWatch it ramp-up to silly levels in 2021 .\nFrom Recession to Depression \u2013 Any fool can see it : because of the deft kamikaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insane levels of QE , zero interest rates , currencies inflated like cheap party balloons , debt is at record levels , the stock market is being pumped up with government steroids , and everything else is over-leveraged .\nUnemployment is at record levels .\nGovernments do not seem to care \u2013 they are printing money literally like there \u2019 s no tomorrow ( maybe they know something we don \u2019 t yet ) .\nIt \u2019 s a house of cards waiting to collapse at any moment .\nFrankly , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t see a major financial institutional or country ( s ) failure in 2021 , and one which will surely trigger a global meltdown , and likely sent a few national currencies into hyper-inflation free-fall \u2013 maybe even the US dollar .\nAnd when it finally blows up , they won \u2019 t blame themselves , they \u2019 ll all say it \u2019 s because of the virus .\nThat last part you can take to the bank .\nCalifornia Exodus ( to Texas ) \u2013 This is trend which is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleeing the Golden State for years \u2013 to Nevada , Colorado , Idaho , Arizona , Oregon , and Washington state .\nBut the latest and most significant wave is breaking towards the great state of Texas .\nAlready , major technology firms like Tesla , Oracle , and HP have announced they \u2019 ve had enough of California \u2019 s crippling taxation and regulatory regimes , and so they \u2019 re taking their industries , and thousands of high-paying employees , to a state where they can get more bang for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax , and property is much more affordable \u2013 which means high earners from CA will be much better off .\nAnother reason for this latest wave is also due to crazed Democrat ideologues like Governor Gavin Newsom , and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti \u2013 both of who have taken a hard turn towards fascism since COVID lockdowns began \u2013 as political leaders , they seem to be enjoying their newfound totalitarian powers a little too much .\nBusinesses and people can see this , and therefore know that the state is slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is collapsing as well .\nLeaving the Hotel California ?\nNew York Exodus ( to Florida ) \u2013 Similarly , many New Yorkers ( and New Jersey residents too ) , have seen how crazy their Democratic Governors and Mayors ( Cuomo and De Blassio ) have become , power-thirsty over draconian lockdowns and forcing thousands of businesses into bankruptcy , and closing schools \u2013 all under the increasingly dubious guise of \u201c keeping people safe.\n\u201d As a result , many are packing up and moving to the Sunshine State \u2013 better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbot in Texas , Florida \u2019 s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has vowed \u201c never to lockdown the state again.\n\u201d On top of this , major Wall Street names like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have announced they \u2019 re moving parts of their operations south to warmer waters .\nOthers will likely follow .\nThis will be a real blow to the perennial ego of New York City , but it only goes to show that if you take your business community for granted and bully them into an economic hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lurch .\nFor Florida it \u2019 s going to be a major social and economic boom .\nUS Migrant Crisis Continues \u2013 One of the major achievement of the Trump administration was to slow down the surge of Central American migrants across the US southern border .\n\u201c Build the Wall \u201d was the catchy rallying cry , but below the surface of that was a change in DHS and Border control policy when send a loud message to the illegal \u201c Coyote Caravans \u201d coming from Central America : you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the US .\nA a result , the migrant surges stopped .\nNo surprise there .\nA Biden administration will most certainly seek to reverse this , with a renewed push by Democrats to open the US southern border to an endless stream of what Joe Biden calls \u2018 hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers.\n\u2019 It \u2019 s no secret that the Democrat Party views these as future voters and their key to turning states like Texas blue .\nSo that political war is set to heat up again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into the 2024 election .\nMass Shootings and Domestic \u2019 Terror \u2013 If a Biden-Harris administration assumes the reins of power in Washington , this could coincide with an increasing in that phenomenon they call \u201c mass shootings \u201d and school shootings in America .\nThese events were down from the normal frequency during the Trump administration , but during the Obama administration \u2013 especially between the period of 2012 to 2016 , there seemed to a high-profile \u201c Active Shooter \u201d media event every few weeks .\nThis was generally regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the FBI have never been held to account over their clear involvement in the background of so many of these Daily Shooter incidents .\nSome of these events were also filed under the category of \u201c home-grown terrorism , \u201d including some contrived FBI bomber \u2018 stings \u2019 supposedly \u201c linked to \u201d or \u201c inspired by ISIS.\n\u201d Interestingly , a disturbing majority of these events will feature FBI informants , active duty or former military , and persons connected with CIA operations overseas , or some ill-conceived FBI \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background .\nAnd without fail , political forces in Washington and the Media will leap to try and use the event for political leverage \u2013 whether its for the Democrat \u2019 s increasingly vociferous \u201c gun control \u201d issue , or to use as a legal justification for a foreign policy , like the unlikely San Bernardino Attack under Obama which was then used as the legal justification for anti-ISIS operations in Syria .\nWill it be a return to the bad old days ?\nISIS Comeback ?\n\u2013 As the legend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out of the bottle \u2013 it \u2019 s hard to put it back inside .\nCertainly that \u2019 s the case with the Western and Gulf covert intelligence machine \u2019 s most gruesome creation to date , the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham , or \u201c ISIS \u201d .\nLiterally overnight in July 2014 , this new terror brand managed to usurp al-Qaeda from the headlines and became the western \u2018 national security \u2019 obsession until 2019 .\nThe Western Media couldn \u2019 t get enough of ISIS , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention is was great for MSM ratings .\nThus , the brand \u2019 s seedy allure is still strong among young extremists seeking adventure in regions like the Middle East and Africa .\nIf Biden assumes power , expect a return of ISIS , and with it , a renewed raison d \u2019 etre for foreign intervention in Syria and other unwelcome locations by Washington \u2019 s bipartisan brood of warhawks .\nMonopolies and Mergers \u2013 Silicon Valley is due for a major shake-up \u2013 not just firms leaving to Texas , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding issues .\nWhile Google , Facebook and Apple continue hoovering up the promising start-up apps and increasing their users and revenue , Twitter is fast becoming the odd man out , as it \u2019 s despondent CEO Jack Dorsey seems to have lost interest in the struggling company , now sharing his time running another firm .\nHence , Twitter it faltering and could get swallowed by another giant , creating a larger monster in the land of digital monopolies .\nBy the way \u2013 expect the political censorship and deplatforming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to threats by the US Senate to move in on Section 230 protections .\nIf Washington wins that battle , it could radically alter online rules on social media platforms .\nWatch this space .\nBlock chain \u2013 In terms of tech trends , no other mercurial foundational technology is moving quite as fast as blockchain , and all of its various applications .\nThe reason it \u2019 s moving quicker now is because it \u2019 s married with finance , and may one day be the de facto digital platform for settling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B2B \u2013 meaning that people and businesses may not have to go through a corporate intermediary .\nThis is already happening on the cryptocurrency exchanges .\nIn addition to this , blockchain may end up becoming the platform for trading stocks , bonds , other currencies , and to settle and authenticate contracts and official documents .\nIn short , this may be the next major infrastructure overhaul since the internet itself .\nBitcoin \u2013 2020 was a massive year for crypto currencies and token coins , and this next year will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy \u2019 continues to be strangled by insane government COVID policies , it \u2019 s no surprise that Bitcoin shattered the $ 20K barrier late this year , and according to a number of financial gurus , it \u2019 s due to go even further in 2021 , possibly \u2018 orbital \u2019 \u2013 up to $ 100K .\nAlready , major financial institutions are getting big into Bitcoin , as are some high-profile billionaires \u2013 all of which may drive the price up even higher .\nThere are other , better designed coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etherium , Ripple , INX , or even BAT , but the Bitcoin brand is still holding its wealth-storage value reputation as virtual gold in the crypto world .\nExpect even more Bitcoin millionaires to be made in 2021 .\nVR Headsets \u2013 That day has finally arrived which so many have dreaded \u2013 when virtual reality gaming ( and other adult recreational pursuits ) is reaching critical mass in market adoption .\nIn terms of home entertainment , this is next level tech , and likely next level additive as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of semi-professional males existing in a semi-vegetative state for much of their week .\nOf course , Silicon Valley loves this , as they \u2019 ll be able to lock-down more paying customers \u2013 and VR is now getting cheaper and more affordable too .\nThis is coupled to another potentially big market \u2013 virtual real estate , assets and game characters which are already becoming an appreciative commodity online , including a $ 50K sale of a digital replica of the European city of Amsterdam on the virtual platform Second Life .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ real .\n5G Network \u2013 All of this new and expanding virtual matrix will be powered by the rapidly expanding 5G network .\nHowever , tech wizards and governments have dismissed any concerns about health and safety of 5G \u2013 calling them a \u201c conspiracy theory \u201d and will almost certainly avoid any reports of problems going forward so as not to impede the \u2018 progress \u2019 of this next-gen wireless roll-out .\nThings to be concerned about : 5G will not only be the backbone to an ever more intrusive hyper-surveillance state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and it \u2019 s going to power smart roads which will limit your speed and ultimately pave the way for unmanned , driver-less cars , lorries and deliveries vehicles .\nAnd that \u2019 s just the beginning .\nHow far and how fast will it go ?\nSmart Headsets \u2013 Now that you \u2019 re jacked-in on the 5G-powered digital universe , the next generation of \u2018 engagement \u2019 devices for this new matrix will be enhanced video headsets , which means those crazy Google Glasses may soon come of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be \u201c smart lens \u201d , wearable tech which can be inserted into your eye like a contact lens \u2013 meaning you can be online all the time .\nThe smart lens is a few years off , but look for its progenitors to beginning making a beta splash in late 2021 .\nThis could easily spiral into a dystopic nightmare along the lines of Bruce Willis

scared of this # WomensWave that they shut it down for us .\n1000+ women , survivors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building .\nEvery hallway .\nEvery floor.\n\u201d Very easy-going press coverage .\nNo problem .\nNo outrage .\nNo accusations of Insurrection from the mainstream press .\nIt was a protest from the Left , covered by the Left .\nAnd the Capitol Police promptly shut down the original target : the Capitol Building .\nThey didn \u2019 t lead the protestors INTO the Capitol , as they astonishingly did a few days ago , on January 6 .\nHere \u2019 s another item from 2018 on the same protest\u2014ABC News : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were arrested for \u2018 unlawfully demonstrating \u2019 outside of senators \u2019 offices and in the main rotunda of the Russell Senate Building .\nAbout half as many protesters were arrested for protesting Kavanaugh on Thursday.\n\u201d Ho-hum .\nAnother day at the office .\nNot a word about \u201c the desecration of our democracy.\n\u201d Now if you really want to revisit a chaotic moment in federal-building takeovers , let \u2019 s go back to 1954 .\nThe US House of Representatives Archives has an account : \u201c On March 1 , 1954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floor for an upcoming vote , three men and one woman entered the visitor \u2019 s gallery above the chamber and quietly took their seats .\nAll four belonged to the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and only hours earlier had traveled from New York City to Washington , DC.\n\u201d \u201c The United States had annexed Puerto Rico in 1898 , and the island \u2019 s relationship with the federal government had long been a point of contention .\nSome Puerto Ricans sought to maintain their relationship with the mainland , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House that day , argued for an independent Puerto Rico.\n\u201d \u201c The Capitol had few security protocols at the time , and the four Puerto Rican nationalists entered the gallery armed with handguns .\nAround 2:30 p.m. they indiscriminately opened fire onto the House Floor and unfurled a Puerto Rican flag in a violent act of protest meant to draw attention to their demand for Puerto Rico \u2019 s immediate independence.\n\u201d \u201c Five Congressmen were wounded in the shooting.\n\u201d \u201c Members , House Pages , and police officers quickly helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery , while the fourth escaped the Capitol and was apprehended later that afternoon.\n\u201d Joe Bartlett , a House Page at the time , recalls : \u201c I had just had a bundle of bills and had just stepped out the center door , on my way to the Senate , with these bills .\nI heard what sounded like , a stack of folding chairs falling\u2014these metal folding chairs\u2026I turned around and ran right back into the chamber , and

was stretched out there\u2026the wound contributed to his early death years later .\nBentley had been shot through the abdomen\u2026Representative [ Kenneth Allison ] Roberts of Alabama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone .\nHe was shot through the knee .\nAnd that bullet had come through the chair that Sam Rayburn , as the Minority Leader , had regularly sat in .\nFortunately , Mr. Rayburn was not sitting there at that moment .\nThe bullet shattered Roberts \u2019 knee\u2026Ben Jensen of Iowa was shot in the shoulder , and the bullet followed under his hide to his waist\u2026 \u201d After what happened on

reported that the outgoing Capitol Police Chief , Steve Sund , believes his efforts to secure the premises were undermined by a lack of concern from House and Senate security officials who answer directly to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate leader Mitch McConnell .\nThe National Pulse can also report the Washington Post \u2019 s timeline proves it was impossible for Trump speech attendees to have made it to the Capitol in time for the breach .\nIn addition to the fact that Trump openly called for the \u201c cheering on \u201d of Congressman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as established from numerous , establishment media reports simply doesn \u2019 t stack up .\nThe admission that House and Senate security leaders failed to provide Capitol Police with resources on the day will raise questions over their role in the day \u2019 s events .\nTwo days before Congress was set to formalize President-elect Joe Biden \u2019 s victory , Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund was growing increasingly worried about the size of the pro-Trump crowds expected to stream into Washington in protest .\nTo be on the safe side , Sund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to request that the D.C. National Guard be placed on standby in case he needed quick backup .\nBut , Sund said Sunday , they turned him down .\nIn his first interview since pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol last week , Sund , who has since resigned his post , said his supervisors were reluctant to take formal steps to put the Guard on call even as police intelligence suggested that the crowd President Trump had invited to Washington to protest his defeat probably would be much larger than earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irving said he wasn \u2019 t comfortable with the \u201c optics \u201d of formally declaring an emergency ahead of the demonstration , Sund said .\nMeanwhile , Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger suggested that Sund should informally seek out his Guard contacts , asking them to \u201c lean forward \u201d and be on alert in case Capitol Police needed their help .\nIrving could not be reached for comment .\nA cellphone number listed in his name has not accepted messages since Wednesday .\nMessages left at a residence he owns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no answer Sunday evening at a Watergate apartment listed in his name .\nA neighbor said he had recently moved out .\nSund recalled a conference call with Pentagon officials and officials from the D.C. government .\nHe said on the call : \u201c I am making an urgent , urgent immediate request for National Guard assistance\u2026 I have got to get boots on the ground.\n\u201d But the request was apparently denied over optics .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t like the visual of the National Guard standing a police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d an Army official replied .\nJohn Falcicchio , chief of staff for D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser admitted : \u201c Literally , this guy is on the phone , I mean , crying out for help .\nIt \u2019 s burned in my memories.\n\u201d And while the Washington Post clumsily attempts to blame President Trump for the violence \u2013 despite the President calling for \u201c peaceful \u201d protests and the \u201c cheering on \u201d of Congressmen \u2013 their own article admits the \u201c first wave of protesters arrived at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s speech didn \u2019 t conclude until 1:11pm , and with at least a 45-minute walk between the two locations with crowd-related delays , that would put the first people from Trump \u2019 s speech at Capitol Hill no earlier than 1:56pm \u2013 a full hour and sixteen minutes after troublemakers arrived .\nIn fact , rioters who breached the perimeter would have had to leave before Trump \u2019 s speech even began ( at 12pm precisely ) to make it in time for the events as they are detailed by authorities .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sund \u2019 s outer perimeter on the Capitol \u2019 s west side was breached within 15 minutes , \u201d meaning the Capitol was breached over an hour before Trump speech attendees could have even begun to arrive .\nThis correlates with Sund \u2019 s interview , where he admits : \u201c I realized at 1pm , things aren \u2019 t going well\u2026 I \u2019 m watching my people getting slammed.\n\u201d Again , 1pm would have been a full 56-minutes before any Trump speech-attendees could have begun arriving , let alone breaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , D.C. roads were closed .\nThere was no way of arriving faster , let alone before the President had finished speaking .\nAt 1:09pm , still before the President had finished speaking , Sund called the Sergeants-at-arms of the House and Senate .\nHe told them it was time to call in the National Guard .\nHe even said he wanted an emergency declaration .\nBoth , however , said they would \u201c run it up the chain \u201d and get back to him .\nAt 1:50pm the Capitol itself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendees could have arrived .\nWhat happened after this point was a back and forth over hours between D.C. officials , Army officials , and Capitol police .\nAnd while Sund is quoted in the Washington Post as blaming President Trump \u2019 s speech for the violence that ensued \u2013 the timeline means that makes no sense .\nThe President \u2019 s fans are not known for leaving his speeches 5 or 10 minutes in .\nAnd by the time the Capitol was breached , those who had stayed to listen to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even made it there in time .\nPLEASE HELP

"content": "If the blatant mainstream media bias we \u2019 ve seen in 2020 has taught us anything , it \u2019 s that independent reporting and news outlets are essential to get any real understanding of events in the United States .\nYet leftist journalists in mainstream media are calling for unelected , big tech companies to deplatform independent journalists .\nAmong those being nominated for cancellation are Andy Ngo , editor-at-large for The Post Millennial ( where I \u2019 m also an editor ) ; The Blaze \u2019 s Elijah Schaffer ; Mollie Hemingway of The Federalist ; Dasha Nekrasova and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan Bongino .\nSchaffer was removed from Facebook and Instagram , and Red Scare and its hosts were yanked from Twitter , as was Bongino .\nThe move to an alternative social media platform , Parler , has been hindered by Google and Apple app stores refusing to carry the app , and by Amazon nuking Parler \u2019 s servers .\nThe mob of leftist journalists demanding the ouster of other journalists is a horrifying trend , but it \u2019 s all in the name of social justice .\nMany demanded the removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Twitter , and now that Twitter has banned him permanently , they rejoice in the squashing of free speech .\nAs Ngo told me , \u201c Left-wing journalists see an ally in Twitter and now feel emboldened to make more demands of censorship.\n\u201d The corporate media narrative throughout the summer of 2020 was clear : any action taken in the name of social justice was acceptable .\nThey barely showed the violence and destruction , and when they did , they glossed it over , changing the language to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the work of independent journalists and outlets , we would not have seen the violence that came with these protests , understood who was committing the violence , or gotten any insight into these disruptive movements under the surface of American culture .\nThese journalists are now under threat of erasure by social media companies , and by those who are asking social media to target them .\nNgo has come under fire from those he has exposed .\nHaving worked to cover the Antifa-led protest movement in his home town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a target to those who would like anonymity as they attempt to disrupt the social and political order of the country .\nMany corporate reporters didn \u2019 t believe Ngo when he dragged these bad actors into the light , showing mug shots of their arrests , digging into their social accounts to expose their motivations .\nEven after Ngo was brought to testify before the House and Senate on Antifa \u2019 s involvement in riot activity across the country , Joe Biden called Antifa an \u201c idea , not an organization.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to discredit Ngo for years , and now that big tech companies are on their side , they see an opening to try to get him , and his reporting , taken down for good .\nAmong those calling for his ouster is Sarah Jeong , a New York Times writer whose racist vitriol was not an issue for the Times either when they hired her or when she repeated it while on staff .\nJeong wrote on Twitter , \u201c I wonder when Twitter is going to ban A*dy N*o , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticizing his reporting .\nTo be clear , this is a writer for The New York Times , which is basically the premiere U.S. legacy outlet , calling for a journalist to be banned .\nJeong had written previously \u201c Are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun , thus logically being only fit to live underground like groveling goblins.\n\u201d This was fine to say , apparently , but to Jeong reporting on rampant crime and the criminals who undertake it in one \u2019 s own home town is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vice started the call for Ngo \u2019 s removal on Jan. 8 , claiming that Ngo , whose family has been threatened as part of the attempts to silence his reporting , is a liar , without proof .\nFarley tried to link Ngo to far-right propagandists who bolstered Trump conspiracy theories .\nAgain , this is both circumstantial and a serious stretch .\nFarley is another journalist asking for unelected big tech companies to silence the free press .\nSchaffer of The Blaze was instrumental in covering the riots and demonstrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage .\nHe , like Ngo , was attacked by the bad actors he exposed .\nIn each of these cases , those committing crimes for their own political or avaricious ends would rather shut up the reporter than be exposed .\nSchaffer \u2019 s accounts were removed from both Facebook and Instagram .\n\u201c Reporting the truth is now illegal , \u201d Schaffer wrote on Twitter .\nSchaffer revealed that the social justice narrative was being used as a cover for some seriously criminal activity , and that the altruism mainstream media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matter protests was not altogether accurate .\nCoverage of the protests and riots on CNN , MSNBC , The New York Times , and the Washington Post , to name a few , praised those who broke lockdown orders and coronavirus restrictions to express their anger in the streets .\nAnyone who opposed those actions , or wanted to break the restrictions for any other reason was selfish , and sometimes a racist .\nThey did not cover that those who back those protests and riots are pushing not for a return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and political order .\nCorporate media bias brought us the phrase \u201c mostly peaceful \u201d during the 2020 summer of outrage .\nAs more than 7,750 protests were staged in 2,400 locations across the country in the wake of George Floyd \u2019 s death on May 25 , violent demonstrations erupted in 220 of those locations , some of which were sustained for more than 100 days , as in Portland , Ore .\nWhile corporate outlets covered the events from the edges , giving nothing but snapshot visuals and chyrons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who covered what was going on from the inside out .\nWe \u2019 re hearing from big tech companies and their allies in mainstream media that only one perspective is valid , and that if you \u2019 re a journalist who fights for truth , even at the risk of your own safety , you are at risk of

farther afield .\nFrom Tunisia , Zuckerberg \u2019 s vision flew to Egypt , where another young girl , Asmaa Mahfouz , also posted a video message ( or \u201c vlog , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Facebook page on 18 January 2011 .\nA little more then a month later , I asked this question in an English-language Turkish newspaper : \u201c [ c ] an it really be the case that a video message ( or vlog ) posted on a Facebook profile by a young Egyptian , Asmaa Mahfouz , was the impetus needed for the protests on Tahrir Square to explode ?\n\u201d ( 27 February 2011 ) .\nBehind the Scenes : The Bush Plan to grow Democracy around the world The answer appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the recently non-extradited-but-still-imprisoned Julian Assange : \u201c A cable dated Dec. 30 , 2008 , indicates that a leader of the April 6 Youth Movement [ in Egypt ] \u2013 a Facebook-driven opposition group \u2013 informed U.S. officials that opposition groups had come up with a plan to topple Hosni Mubarak before scheduled elections in September 2011 .\nThe cables also indicate that the U.S. authorities helped an April 6 leader [ tentatively identified as Wael Ghonim , then-Google head of marketing for the Middle East and North Africa ] to attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit at Columbia University in New York on Dec. 3 -5 , 2008 .\nAt the time , the U.S. government promoted this event as an occasion bringing together \u2018 Facebook , Google , YouTube , MTV , Howcast , Columbia Law School and the U.S. Department of State .\n.\n.\nto Find Best Ways to Use Digital Media to Promote Freedom and Justice , Counter Violence , Extremism and Oppression.\n\u2019 The participating youth leaders were expected to \u2018 produce a field manual for youth empowerment , \u2019 adding that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the al-Qaeda manual on the basics of terrorism , found by Coalition Forces in Iraq \u2019 , \u201d as I wrote in 2011 .\nIn fact , on 24 November 2008 , the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs James K. Glassman introduced the press to the Egyptian participants during a \u2018 Special Briefing To Announce the Alliance of Youth Movement \u2019 in the following manner : This press conference shows that the U.S. State Department during the George W. Bush administration ( 20 January 2001-20 January 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and covert goals around the world .\nIn fact , the State Department appeared to doing what the President had pledged during his second inaugural address ( 20 January 2005 ) : The 2005 words are in stark contrast to the remarks Bush made when sparring with Al Gore in the run up to the 2000 election , saying loudly and happily , \u201c I don \u2019 t think our troops ought to be used for what \u2019 s called nation building , \u201d or encouraging democracy around the globe .\nIn 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Department quite openly advocated the use of Facebook , Google , YouTube , MTV , and also a website called Howcast , that has somehow managed to evade the limelight but that still fulfills the vital task of providing \u201c The best how-to videos.\n\u201d The Columbia associate professor of law Matthew Waxman was prominently present at the event , giving this regime change conference a nice academic veneer of credibility .\nAlso present were \u2018 such luminaries as Whoopi Goldberg , actress and host of ABC \u2019 s \u201c The View @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Facebook and the just-mentioned Glassman .\nIt took a little more than a year for Ali Bouazizi to make his now legendary Facebook post , which acted as the catalyst that initiated a domino effect in the MENA region .\nAnd then , the Bush plan got into overdrive for real .\nThe Tahrir Square protests led to Mubarek \u2019 s downfall ( 11 February 2011 ) , the sudden rise and fall of Mohammed Morsi ( elected on 24 June 2012 and arrested on 3 July 2013 ) , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abdel Fatah el-Sisi ( 3 July 2013 ) .\nThe Bush-supported \u2018 democratic movements and institutions \u2019 in the MENA region clearly instigated , if not downright perpetrated , these social media-led mass movements to spring up all around \u2013 notably leading to the violent death of Libya \u2019 s Muammar al-Gaddafi ( 20 October 2011 ) and the outbreak of Syria \u2019 s not-so civil war aimed at unseating Bashar al-Assad ( March 2011 ) .\n.\n.\nand basically leading the whole of the wider Middle East into a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already started with the Bush invasion of Iraq on 20 March 2003 .\nPresident Obama ( 2009-17 ) all but continued Bush \u2019 s foreign policy , as the \u201c not-so veiled campaign against \u2018 Islamic militancy \u2019 euphemistically called the War on Terror-renamed-the Overseas Contingency Operation continue [ d ] unabated \u201d under his watch .\nAs a matter of fact , as I pointed out in 2016 , this whole military campaign amounted to a veritable \u201c Crusade Against Islam , \u201d with its roots in Carter presidency ( 1977-81 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski ( 1928-2017 ) .\nWhereas Bush was famously guided by Dick Cheney and his faith as a born-again Christian , Obama simply tried to revive Cold War \u201c Christian realism , \u201d in the mould of Reinhold Niebuhr \u2019 ( 1892-1971 ) .\nHis successor , on the other hand , did not at first sight disclose any religious inspiration \u2013 the media-friendly-yet-clearly-somewhat clueless atheist Sam Harris even publicly stated that Trump could \u201c be our first atheist president , \u201d months before the election .\nTrump \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself clearly showed that he would be anything but an \u201c atheist president , \u201d as \u201c Trump \u2019 s most loyal supporters were and are white evangelicals , \u201d in the words of the sociologist Dr Philip Gorski .\nThough Trump \u2019 s term was far from a peaceful period \u2013 we need but remember the dropping of the Mother of All Bombs ( MOAB ) on an \u201c ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan \u2019 s eastern Nangarhar Province , along the border with Pakistan \u201d ( 13 April 2017 ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soleimani in Baghdad ( 3 January 2020 ) .\nBut , he did not continue the Bush foreign policy and famously talked a lot about bringing an end to America \u2019 s \u201c endless wars.\n\u201d While , at the same time , nevertheless outdoing his predecessor , \u201c increas [ ing ] drone bombing by 300 % since the Obama admin [ instration , ] resulting in many more civilian deaths , \u201d as expressed by the journalist Derrick Broze on Twitter .\nOn the domestic front , President Trump ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d according to frequent MSNBC and CNN contributor David Cay Johnston ) proved much more divisive , with his detractors oftentimes calling him a \u2018 fascist \u2019 and even comparing him to Adolf Hitler ( 1889-1945 ) .\nFollowing last November \u2019 s elections , however , it seems that the business of American politics will revert to the accustomed status quo of yesteryear .\nStill , Trump and his supporters are more than unwilling to accept defeat and recognize Obama \u2019 s erstwhile Vice President as the legally elected incoming new President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality on the ground has now led to the so-called \u2018 Capitol Riots \u2019 on 6 January 2020 , in an attempt to disrupt ( and possibly thwart ) the joint session of Congress \u2019 s official counting of the electoral votes ( \u201c 306 for Joe Biden and 232 for Donald Trump \u201d ) , and even leading to the deaths of five individuals .\nFrom China , Dr. Emily Jane O \u2019 Dell tweeted that the \u201c US Capitol riot was a targeted mob hit \u2014 ordered from the top.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a coup attempt .\nBut , the veteran contrarian journalist John Pilger tweeted matter-of-factly that the \u201c made-for-media theatrics on Capitol Hill was not an attempted \u2018 coup \u2019 , pointing out that real Coups are what the CIA stages all over the world .\nNeither was \u2018 democracy \u2019 in peril .\nWhat democracy ?\nAnd Trump is no more than a caricature of a system of which Biden , Obama , Bush etc are the embodiment.\n\u201d Rebecca Klar , The Hill \u2018 s tech reporter based in Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] upporters of President Trump mused openly on social media about the possibility of violence in the days leading up to the riot at the Capitol , using various mainstream and conservative-leaning sites to organize.\n\u201d Adding that \u201c [ p ] osts on websites including Parler , a Twitter-like platform with minimal content moderation , and TheDonald.win , a message forum that sprung up after Reddit banned a \u2018 subreddit \u2019 of the same name in June [ 2020 ] , were rife with posts about storming the Capitol in the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted a lockdown and forced lawmakers to evacuate .\nBut posts on mainstream platforms , including Twitter , also mused about a potential attack.\n\u201d In fact , looking at the social media landscape , the most amazing things can be found , like a TikTok video showing a distraught young woman , \u201c Elisabeth , from Knoxville , Tennessee \u201d who tells the camera , \u201c we \u2019 re storming the Capitol , it \u2019 s a revolution.\n\u201d Or , a picture of a man present on the Capitol and wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAR January 6 , 2020.\n\u201d Or , another TikTok video showing two MAGA hat-wearing men having the following exchange : \u2018 MAGA hat wearer 1 : \u201c We can take that place \u201d MAGA hat wearer 2 : \u201c And then do what \u201d MAGA hat wearer 1 : \u201c HEADS ON PIKES \u201d !\n\u2019 According to various video messages posted on the internet , a Texas-based self-described \u201c conservative \u201d activist named Ali Alexander ( a man who is admittedly a known scam artist and wily publicity opportunist ) claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( though at present his personal accounts have all been suspended ) .\nAlexander is in fact a black man , thus putting a bit of a dent into the oftentimes voiced accusations of \u201c White Supremacy \u201d at the heart of the Trump movement .\nThat said , the Washington Post \u2019 s national correspondent Philip Bump has characterized Alexander as a \u201c right-wing personality who has worked with a rogue \u2019 s gallery of notorious characters in that world : Alex Jones , Roger Stone , Jacob Wohl , [ and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander had been at the fringes of the Conservative movement previously , but that at present , \u201c he identifies himself as \u2018 national organizer \u2019 for \u2018 Stop the Steal , \u2019 an organization which adopts the tagline of President Trump \u2019 s ploy to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\u201d In his now suppressed video message , Alexander all but confesses his guilt : \u201c I was the person that came up with the January 6 idea with Congressman Gosar [ R-AZ ] , Congressman Mo Brooks [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ R-AZ ] .\n\u201d Alexander continues that \u201c [ w ] e four schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress , while they were voting , so that who we couldn \u2019 t lobby , we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body hearing our loud war from outside.\n\u201d And as indicated by Rebecca Klar , to that effect , these co-conspirators put various social media platforms to good use , although on a much smaller scale , in a way that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department ten years ago engineered the Arab Spring to supposedly bring democracy to the Middle East and North Africa .\nFollowing the Capitol riots , \u201c [ a ] fter being targeted by # ANTIFA , @ Ali Alexander forced to flee DC , \u201d tweeted an affiliated-and-now-also-disabled Twitter account ( @ StopTheSteakUS ) .\nIn fact , in another video posted on the internet , the notorious Alex Jones tells the camera that the White House had told him beforehand that \u201c we are going to have you lead the march \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hyperbole on the part of a media personality prone to engage in histrionics or an indication that President Trump himself supported the Alexander-engineered social media revolution transported into the real world is an open question at this point .\nAt the same time , though , the internet also provides space for people pushing quite another narrative .\nOn Twitter , a certain Brian Wendt , calling himself The ANTIFA Hunter , posted that he \u201c hacked the ANTIFA headquarters to get a list of their infiltrators , \u201d tweeting a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events with some explanatory captions underneath .\nAdding that \u201c [ t ] his is all the proof needed , \u201d insinuating that agents provocateurs had orchestrated the violence and mayhem in D.C. Another interesting development is the involvement of a supposedly former Black Lives Matter ( BLM ) firebrand activist John Sullivan , heavily active on Twitter before and during the protest , and was one the lead agitators who first entered the Capitol Building .\nSullivan has since been arrested in Utah and charged by a District of Columbia federal court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority , one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds , and one count of interfering with law enforcement engaged in the lawful performance of their official duties incident to and during the commission of civil disorder.\n\u201d For his part , President-elect Joe Biden rebuked Trump supporters \u201c domestic terrorists.\n\u201d During an during an on January 7th event in his home state of Wilmington , Delaware , to introduce some of his Department of Justice cabinet nominees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c one of the darkest days in the history of our nation , \u201d and a \u201c unprecedented assault on our democracy , \u201d talking a clear political line that , \u201c They weren \u2019 t protesters .\nDon \u2019 t dare call them protesters .\nThey were a riotous mob , insurrectionists , domestic terrorists .\nIt \u2019 s that basic .\nIt \u2019 s that simple.\n\u201d Subsequent proclamations were made by leading Democrats and papers of record \u2013 to treat the Capitol incident as \u2018 domestic 9/11 \u2019 watershed moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state agencies to refocus their efforts on what they believe is a new scourge \u2018 right-wing domestic terrorism \u2018 .\nThe primacy of social media activism behind the emergence of the events that are now being called the Capitol riots ( or \u201c The Putsch of January 6 , 2021 , \u201d in the admittedly quite flowery language of the lawyer James D. Zirin ) seems to indicate that the State Department \u2019 s Alliance of Youth Movements strategy has now also penetrated the psyche of homegrown disenchanted masses , albeit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by youngsters .\n.\n.\nIf anything , the Trump presidency has given the disenchanted ( many of whom now believe themselves to be disenfranchised ) courage and momentum .\nAlas , the disenchanted masses now seem to have , for the moment , brought a premature end to Trump \u2019 s political ambitions , as he has now been impeached for a second time ( 13 January 2021 ) .\nAlbeit that the Senate trial will probably happen under a Biden White House : \u201c Donald Trump \u2019 s second impeachment trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond a president \u2019 s time in office , creating a novel legal question that ultimately could require Supreme Court resolution.\n\u201d Have the chickens now really come home to roost in the waning days of the Trump presidency ?\nAnd , what will Biden do in the face of ongoing opposition and protest on the streets ?\nWill armed protests at all 50 state capitals and in Washington , D.C on the day of Biden \u2019 s inauguration mark the beginning of a Second Civil War or will they merely be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement ?\n*** 21WIRE special contributor Dr. Can Erimtan is an independent historian and geo-political analyst who used to live in Istanbul .\nAt present , he is in

it was only one year ago that the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , backed by the global mainstream media , began stoking a global panic over the emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan , China .\nNow , a year later , as Western countries languish in a self-induced collapse , China \u2019 s economy is not only bouncing back \u2013 it is booming , and set to expand even faster than it had in previous

TV program Nieuwsuur , \u201c Things were relatively quiet until 7.30pm , but then all hell broke loose.\n\u201d It is the first such curfew imposed in the country since the Nazi occupation during World War II .\nAt least 151 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch police .\nAngry protesters also torched a mobile COVID testing facility over the weekend .\nIn Rotterdam , the mayor invoked new \u2019 emergency powers \u2019 and summarily deployed riot police and water cannons in an attempt to quell unrest .\nAccording to reports from Dutch News , \u201c In Haarlem and Rotterdam police threatened to use tear gas to break up the crowds , and extra riot police were drafted in , Woelders said .\nIn Amersfoort , fireworks were thrown at police and there were also problems in Den Bosch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 youngsters had gathered in defiance of the 9pm curfew , and a Jumbo supermarket was plundered.\n\u201d Video footage of angry youth taking to the streets last night : In Amsterdam and Eindhoven , riot police and tear gas were deployed and some 300 people were arrested in an effort to disperse the demonstrators .\nAccording to Dutch Prime minister Mark Rutte has dismissed the protestors as outliers which followed on from organized anti-lockdown protests which were happening across the country over the weekend .\nRutte insists that 99 % of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diktats on the new lockdown and the 9pm curfew which came into effect Saturday .\n\u201c This has nothing to do with protesting : it is criminal violence and that is how we will treat it , \u201d said Rutte .\nHowever , Rutte is basing the entire premise for a renewed lockdown and new curfew on shaky claims coming out of the UK that there is a new \u2018 more dangerous \u2019 and \u2018 more transmissible \u2019 so-called \u201c variant \u201d mutation of coronavirus \u2013 despite the fact the UK government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is either more deadly or more transmissible .\nAccording leading American microbiologist Prof. Vincent R. Racaniello from Columbia University , hysteria around the \u2018 new variant \u2019 is built on hype , and explained how most viral mutations and \u2018 variants \u2019 are of very little consequence , saying that wild claims being made by UK and other European officials that it \u2019 s \u2018 more transmissible \u2019 are not supported by any real scientific data .\nDespite the lack of evidence , UK and European government are still determined to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to further strangle their economies and societies through reactionary lockdown measures .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR WINTER

pandemic of dictatorial tyranny sweeping across the world has taught us anything , it is that the majority of humanity has been so well trained to obey authority that it is now incapable of free thought and afraid to ask questions .\nNever before have we seen such docile conformance to words echoing from the speakers of a television screen as when the Prime Minister of the UK announced in March 2020 that he had \u201c one simple instruction \u201d for the British people\u2026 \u201d You must stay at home \u201d .\nBut Mr Johnson spoke through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation listened .\nWithin an instant the UK economy came to a halt , without question , all because a man , in a suit , on the TV said it should .\nHundreds of thousands of businesses closed their doors to customers and staff .\nSchools and nurseries closed their doors to children , which in turn lead to parents being unable to work because they could not find care for their children .\nUnless of course the man , in a suit on the TV told them that there job was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fine to send their children to school and go out to work .\n\u201c Three weeks \u201d was what the man , in a suit , on the TV said the country needed \u201c to flatten the curve , \u201d .\nBut three weeks turned into five weeks , which turned into eight weeks , which turned into fourteen weeks .\nI wonder how many would have complied for so long with an instruction given to them by a man , in a suit , on the TV if it had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit , on the TV promising to subsidize up to eighty percent of their wages for sitting at home and not working ?\nSounds great doesn \u2019 t it , sitting at home and still being paid .\nThe people so eager to accept this scheme most likely didn \u2019 t realise that A ) it was not the man , in a suit , on the TV paying these wages , it was in fact the British taxpayer .\nB ) They would have to pay this money back in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u2019 s only if they still had a job to pay those taxes as the only purpose of this scheme was to delay everyone \u2019 s unemployment to ensure that they complied .\nIt was never about making sure you were going to be okay and have a job to go back to , it was about making sure you were complicit in the destruction of the job market as we know it , in order to bring in the new age of AI .\nWe bet the authorities could not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the vast majority of every man and woman in the land to obey an instruction that was emitted via the telescreen , and boy have they made the most of it ever since .\nOn the 3rd April 2020 , Professor Jonathan Van Tam , deputy chief medical officer for England , told the British public via the \u2018 telescreen \u2019 that he had spoke with a colleague in Hong Kong who had carried out an evidence review for the World Health Organisation and stated they \u201c were of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general wearing of face masks by the public affects the spread of a disease in our society , what matters right now is social distancing .\nIn terms of the hard evidence , we do not recommend face masks for general wearing by the public.\n\u201d Yet fast forward four months and the Government enforced the wearing of face coverings in all indoor public settings .\nHowever we did not instantly see a swarm of face nappy clad folk outdoors for over a week , and why was that ?\nBecause the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV said this would not come into force for another week .\nThat week came and went and on the day of enforcement there was not a smile to be seen .\nBut what does that say about the majority of the British public and their acquiescence to authority .\nNot wearing a face covering because they genuinely thought it would work in the \u201c fight against the virus \u201d , but wearing it because a man , in a suit , on the TV said they would be subject to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so .\nWe know this to be true because they would have worn the face covering from the moment it was announced they were required otherwise .\nFast forward another few months and we were told by Professor Jonathan Van Tam , again via the \u2018 telescreen \u2019 that he did not think there would \u201c come a moment when we can have a big party and throw our masks and hand sanitiser and say \u2018 that \u2019 s it , it \u2019 s behind us \u2019 like the end of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insisting that the wearing of face masks \u201c may persist for many years and that may be a good thing \u201d .\nIMAGE : Under the sponsorship of billionaire oligarchs like Bill Gates , World Economic Forum leader Klaus Schwab has injected the elites \u2019 Great Reset again into western governments .\nThe contractions on the wearing of face masks alone should have been enough for the British public to wake up and question why they were partaking in the destruction of the world as they knew it , unknowingly bringing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the globalists to fast forward their \u201c great reset \u201d agenda .\nBut disappointingly it has yet to be the case .\nInstead we are now stuck in a cycle of stay at home , protect the NHS , save lives , repeat .\nWhenever a man , in a suit , on the TV appears on the British public \u2019 s \u2018 telescreen \u2019 s \u2019 they stand to attention and hang on every word that echoes from the speaker .\nWe don \u2019 t hold much hope that this will @

ideologically driven base of US foreign policy fuelled great resentment among those who believed it betrayed Washington \u2019 s leadership position in the so-called \u201c liberal international order.\n\u201d Now that power has changed , will the pendulum swing in the opposite direction , with Joe Biden \u2019 s administration applying a radical ideological foreign policy ?\nA recent article by Michael McFaul , once Barack Obama \u2019 s ambassador to Russia and a noted \u2018 Russiagate \u2019 conspiracy theorist , indicates what such an ideological foreign policy would look like .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Contain Putin \u2019 s Russia \u2019 , makes a case for a containment policy .\nContainment : learning from the past or living in the past ?\nTo advance his argument , McFaul quotes George Kennan , the author of the Long Telegram and architect of erstwhile US containment policy against the Soviet Union .\nMcFaul suggests that Kennan \u2019 s advocacy for a \u201c patient but firm and vigilant containment \u201d against the revolutionary Bolshevik regime 75 years ago remains as valid as ever .\nIt would have made more sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansionism and predicted it would trigger another Cold War .\nAs Kennan noted : \u201c there was no reason for this whatsoever .\nNo one was threatening anybody else .\nThis expansion would make the Founding Fathers of this country turn over in their graves.\n\u201d Kennan continued to express disbelief over the rhetoric by the misinformed US leadership , presenting \u201c Russia as a country dying to attack Western Europe .\nDon \u2019 t people understand ?\nOur differences in the Cold War were with the Soviet Communist regime .\nAnd now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very people who mounted the greatest bloodless revolution in history to remove that Soviet regime.\n\u201d Kennan then went on to correctly predict that , when Russia would eventually react to US provocations , the NATO expanders would wrongfully blame Russia .\nIdeologues often have nostalgia for the Cold War , when the bipolar power distribution was supported by a clear and comfortable ideological divide .\nThe Western bloc represented capitalism , Christianity , and democracy , while the Eastern bloc represented communism , atheism , and authoritarianism .\nThis ideological divide supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew clear borders with the adversary .\nThe liberal international order has attempted to recast the former capitalist-communist divide with a liberal-authoritarian divide .\nHowever , the ideological incompatibility between American liberalism and Russian conservatism is less convincing .\nFor example , McFaul cautions against Putin \u2019 s nefarious conservative ideology committed to \u201c Christian , traditional family values \u201d that threatens the liberal international order .\nThe new ideological divide nonetheless advances neo-McCarthyism in the West .\nMcFaul presents a list of European conservatives and populists that should be treated as American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies of the liberal international order and thus possible agents of Russia .\nHillary Clinton even suggested that the Capitol Hill riots were possibly coordinated by Trump and Putin \u2013 yes , Russiagate is here to stay .\nThe solution , for McFaul , is for American tech oligarchs to manipulate algorithms to protect populations from Russian-friendly media .\nMcFaul cautions against what he refers to as \u201c Putin \u2019 s ideological project \u201d as a threat to the liberal international order .\nYet he is reluctant to recognize that the liberal international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post-Cold War era .\nAfter the Cold War , liberal ideologues advanced what was seemingly a benign proposition \u2013 suggesting that liberal democracy should be at the center of security strategies .\nHowever , by linking liberal norms to US leadership , liberalism became both a constitutional principle and an international hegemonic norm .\nNATO is presented as a community of liberal values \u2013 without mentioning that its second largest member , Turkey , is more conservative and authoritarian than Russia \u2013 and Moscow does not , therefore , have any legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy .\nIf Russia reacts negatively to military encirclement , it is condemned as an enemy of democracy , and NATO has a moral responsibility to revert to its original mission as a military bloc containing Russia .\nCase in point : there was nobody in Moscow advocating for the reunification with Crimea until the West supported the coup in Ukraine .\nYet , as Western \u201c fact checkers \u201d and McFaul inform us , there was a \u201c democratic revolution \u201d and not a coup .\nCommitted to his ideological prism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fear of having a democracy on its borders , as it would give hope to Russians and thus threaten the Kremlin .\nMcFaul \u2019 s ideological lens masks conflicting national security interests , and it fails to explain why Russia does not mind democratic neighbors in the east , such as South Korea and Japan , with whom it enjoys good relations .\nStates aspiring for global hegemony have systemic incentives to embrace ideologies that endow them with the right to defend other peoples .\nThe French National Convention declared in 1792 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of all peoples who are seeking to recover their liberty , \u201d and the Bolsheviks proclaimed in 1917 \u201c the duty to render assistance , armed , if necessary , to the fighting proletariat of the other countries.\n\u201d The American liberal international order similarly aims to liberate the people of the world with \u201c democracy promotion \u201d and \u201c humanitarian interventionism \u201d when it conveniently advances US primacy .\nThe American ideological project infers that democracy is advanced by US interference in the domestic affairs of Russia , while democracy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic affairs of US .\nThe liberal international system is one of sovereign inequality to advance global primacy .\nMcFaul does not consider himself a Russophobe , as believes his attacks against Russia are merely motivated by the objective of liberating Russians from their government , which is why he advocates that Biden \u201c distinguish between Russia and Russians \u2013 between Putin and the Russian people.\n\u201d This has been the modus operandi for regime change since the end of the Cold War \u2013 the US supposedly does not attack countries to advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign peoples in rival states against their leaders such as Slobodan Milosevic , Saddam Hussein , Muammar Gaddafi , Xi Jinping , Vladimir Putin etc .\nMcFaul and other liberal ideologues still refer to NATO as a \u201c defensive alliance , \u201d which does not make much sense after the attacks on Yugoslavia in 1999 or Libya in 2011 .\nHowever , under the auspices of liberal internationalism , NATO is defensive , as it defends the people of the world .\nRussia , therefore , doesn \u2019 t have rational reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemns alleged efforts by Russia to interfere in the domestic affairs of the US , before outlining his strategies for interfering in the domestic affairs of Russia .\nMcFaul blames Russian paranoia for shutting down American \u201c non-governmental organizations \u201d that are funded by the US government and staffed by people linked to the US security apparatus .\nHe goes on to explain that the US government must counter this by establishing new \u201c non-government organizations \u201d to educate the Russian public about the evils of their government .\nIdeologues have always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human freedom tend to promise perpetual peace .\nYet , instead of transcending power politics , the ideals of human freedom are linked directly to hegemonic power by the self-proclaimed defender of the ideology .\nWhen ideologues firmly believe that the difference between the current volatile world and utopia can be bridged by defeating its opponents , it legitimizes radical power politics .\nConsequently , there is no sense of irony among the McFauls of the world as US security strategy is committed to global dominance , while berating Russia for \u201c revisionism.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idealistic diplomacy slips too often into fanaticism ; it divides states into good and evil , into peace-loving and bellicose .\nIt envisions a permanent peace by the punishment of the latter and the triumph of the former .\nThe idealist , believing he has broken with power politics , exaggerates its crimes.\n\u201d Glenn Diesen is a Professor at the University of South-Eastern Norway , and an editor at the Russia in Global Affairs journal .\nFollow him on Twitter @ glenndiesen

class of self-styled thought police are just getting warmed up .\nJack \u2019 s got a plan .\nBefore we discuss Twitter \u2019 s latest dystopian add-on feature , let \u2019 s first establish a few important terms of reference as to the role which Big Tech has ascended to .\nThe bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meddling in the 2020 US Election and the mainstream press have worked hard to obfuscate this fact .\nWhen the Hunter Biden laptop scandal materialized prior to the November election , Twitter took the unilateral partisan decision to shutdown any information on the story , and even went so far as to shutdown the account of the New York Post who originally broke the story , and even suspended the White House Press Secretary \u2019 s account for retweeting it , as well as other high-profile .\nEmboldened by Twitter \u2019 s bombast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even \u2018 the Big Guy \u2019 Joe Biden himself \u2013 all clung to one singular narrative claiming the Hunter Biden story was somehow untrue , baseless misinformation planted by The Russians !\n\u2122 to undermine candidate Biden .\nNot only were they all wrong , but we later learned that partisans at FBI had in fact been quietly sitting on Hunter Biden \u2019 s laptop since autumn 2019 , effectively keeping it on ice so as not to hurt Biden \u2019 s Presidential run .\nAfter the election , Twitter , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to be coordinated action to pursue any users who dared to challenge the 2020 election result , in some cases prohibiting terms like \u201c voter fraud \u201d and \u201c election fraud \u201d on their platforms .\nThis wave of censorship and fact-checking came into effect even before many of the court challenges .\nRegardless , the new ad hoc corporate \u2018 truth committees \u2019 appeared omnipotent in their anointed role as information gatekeepers of the new digital public square .\nIf all that wasn \u2019 t enough , after Twitter and Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartel members and Democrat activists then conspired in the take-down an emerging competitor , Parler , taking the social media completely offline , and pressuring its vendors to abandon their service commitments with the new social media firm .\nWhile this approached may have worked for them in the short-term , and indeed helped to achieve the election results they wanted , it won \u2019 t erase that fact Big Tech is guilty of the very crime which Democrats and media mavens spend 5 years trying to convince the world of when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians \u2018 meddled \u2019 and colluded with the Trump campaign in order to install The Donald in the White House in 2016 .\nNow , creative technocrats at Twitter appear to have devised a tangential escape route ( and Section 230 workaround ) from their own obvious culpability in election meddling and political censorship .\nIt \u2019 s called \u201c Birdwatch , \u201d a new feature designed to supposedly combat the supposed omnipresent threat of \u2018 misinformation \u2019 on their platform \u2013 by allowing users to add so-called \u2018 fact-check \u2019 notes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to allow \u2018 regular users \u2019 ( how are going to determine who is a \u2018 regular user \u2019 is another question ) called \u2018 Birdwatchers \u2019 who will be allowed add to fact-check notes and provide \u2018 informative context \u2019 for tweets .\nWait a minute .\nCall me old fashioned , but don \u2019 t Tweets already have a forum for discussion , context and debate ?\nIsn \u2019 t that what the comment section below each Tweet is for ?\nI used to think so .\nSo why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ministry of Truth creating this new wing on Jack \u2019 s bird ?\nAmerican tech entrepreneur and author Vivek Ramaswamy describes part of Twitter \u2019 s political modus operandi in a recent interview ( see video below ) : \u201c If you trace it back to what happened a couple weeks ago , what we saw was actually the liberal wing of government , the liberal wing of Congress , delegating to these social media companies the dirty work that they couldn \u2019 t directly do under the Constitution \u2013 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only President Trump , but hundreds [ actually tens of thousands ] of Conservatives had their accounts purged after what happened on January 6th .\nSo that was step one .\nThese companies took criticism , they took heat .\nSo now of course we see step two , we \u2019 re they \u2019 re now delegating that dirty work to their own users .\nWe aren \u2019 t going to debate each other , but are going to try to cancel one another .\nI think it \u2019 s incredibly divisive.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing every day on the fly .\nIt \u2019 s \u2018 Birdwatch \u2019 today , it will be \u2018 snail watch \u2019 tomorrow .\nIt \u2019 s ultimately are what side of the bed Jack Dorsey wakes up on a given day .\nThey censor Trump , they censored Conservatives , they changed their terms of service \u2013 really on the fly .\nThis really is corporate monarchy , and this so-called \u2018 Birdwatch \u2019 program is really papering-over the fact that this is Sounds like death by a thousand fact-checks .\nSimply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crowdsource the petty censorship they \u2019 ve been doing in-house , which will almost certainly pave the way for some kind of \u2018 trustworthiness \u2019 rating or social credit rating for users on their platform .\nIt \u2019 s doesn \u2019 t take a genius to work out how this will ultimately morph into some sort deplatforming mechanism .\nOf course , they \u2019 re not telling you the whole plan , only the initial nudging exercise .\nIf they unveiled their whole censorship plan , their share price might tank again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplatform President Trump .\nBut the real problem with this latest \u2018 solution \u2019 to free speech is that it opens the door to the worst aspects of organized and state-sponsored trolling , just like Wikipedia \u2019 s failed \u2018 community-driven \u2019 approach to so-called fact-checking which has succumbed to vexatious editors and trolls who \u2019 ve been allowed to vandalize pages and libel political dissenters and journalists on an industrial scale .\nAs a result , Wikipedia \u2019 s reputation has been permanently damaged , as their board continues to turn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online such as the notorious Philip Cross .\nSimilar problems have been created by the UK military \u2019 s online trolling army known as 77th Brigade .\nAs Laurie Clark aptly explained in her feature for Wired magazine : \u201c In 2015 , the British Army announced the creation of the 77th Brigade , a psychological operations unit responsible for \u2018 non-lethal \u2019 warfare that reportedly uses social media to \u201c control the narrative \u201d , as well as disseminating UK government-friendly podcasts and videos .\nAt its creation , the unit announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter for this purpose.\n\u201d In other words , these same Silicon Valley firms who spent the last five years clamping down on supposed \u2018 Russian bot accounts \u2019 but have routinely looked the other way when it comes to proliferation of organized trolling and swarming by certain government , namely the government , military and their contractors from the US and UK .\nIt would be interesting to know whether any of these entities are being allowed access to social media platforms by way of some special Application Programming Interface ( API @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook would allow certain military , intelligence agencies , or other third party state contractors to run large farms of accounts and chat bots from a proprietary dashboard , the same kind used by NATO information warfare units ?\nThat \u2019 s one question we \u2019 d like to ask egalitarian champions Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg .\nAnd then there \u2019 s the Section 230 , the law which protects Big Tech firms from liability for publishing offensive material , a status protected by the claim that they are not publishers exercising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply host a space for users to post content .\nDorsey \u2019 s new \u201c Birdwatch \u201d feature is clearly an attempt to move away from the Section 230 cross hairs and into the Wikipedia zone .\nClearly , these firms have been caught heavily editorializing their users , even along partisan lines .\nThis may eventually prompt a fundamental change to Section 230 down the line , one which may or may hurt Big Tech monopolies , but may also further throttle free speech online .\nIt

biologist , pharmacologist and toxicologist , who has raised the alarm about a number of unanswered questions surrounding the current coronavirus crisis , challenging lockdowns , and also pharmaceutical interventions \u2013 specifically regarding ethics and safety of the new experimental mRNA vaccine .\nAccording the Dr Hockertz , lockdown have never been proven to work , and the rushed nature of new mRNA vaccine may pose an unnecessary risk for countless people .\nAll this and more .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Institute for Experimental and Clinical Toxicology at the University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf from 2003 \u2013 2004 , and was on the board of directors at Fraunhofer Institute for Toxicology and Environmental Medicine in Hamburg from 1995 \u2013 2002 .\nFrom 1986 to 2001 he was a researcher at the Fraunhofer Society in Hanover , and has also worked at the University of Hanover .\nHe completed his first training as a biologist in 1985 and is appointed

.\nToday he is managing partner of tpi consult GmbH , a leading toxicological and pharmacological technology consultancies in Europe .\nListen to this informative discussion with Dr. Hockertz here : First published in German on July 17 , 2020 Translation and speaker : John JJ Jones Interview : Eva Schmidt RADIO MUNICH : Finally , SARS-COV-2 immunity through a saving vaccination , that is what large parts of the population and those in power would like .\nThe pharmaceutical companies receive considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a corona vaccination as quickly as possible .\nBut how quickly is ethically justifiable ?\nHow many risks are hidden due to the speed ?\nThe biologist , pharmacologist and toxicologist Professor STEFAN Hockertz points out a number of unanswered questions and warns against deliberately committing physical injury millions of times if these are not answered in advance .\nDR HOCKERTZ : Have a nice day , Ms. Schmidt !\nI have been a toxicologist and immunologist for 30 years .\nI originally learned immunology and then went into toxicology .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 years , and that includes vaccine development for one .\nThat means , I advise companies that are active in the field of vaccines and develop new vaccines there , but I also work very closely with the Paul Ehrlich Institute , which is responsible for vaccine approval in Germany , so that I am very good at regulating I \u2019 m familiar with vaccines , and have been for 30 years .\nRM : Very good .\nWe can hardly get a better one .\nCan you explain to us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vaccination can be described ?\nDR. HOCKERTZ : Yes .\nFrom my point of view , vaccinations are , and I would like to start off by saying , one of the greatest medical achievements that we have in modern times .\nThey saved us from many , many diseases .\nWe were able to eradicate these diseases as far as possible , like smallpox , for example , by convincing many people to get vaccinated .\nSeen in this way , my basic attitude towards vaccinations is positive .\nUp to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened bacteria or viruses ; I now call them \u201c pathogens \u201d that should infect a person .\nWith the smallpox that I just mentioned , it was cowpox , a pathogen that was somewhat \u201c attenuated \u201d by an animal , as we say , that is , was weakened .\nIn the case of influenza , it is influenza viruses that are attracted to the chicken egg and then also weakened , to then infect us .\nWhen we are vaccinated , we become infected with a weakened pathogen so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it \u201d in order to be able to protect us quickly and actively if we are really infected .\nSo far it has been consistently changed , weakened pathogens that we and our immune system have been able to cope with relatively well .\nThis is the principle of vaccination as we have been doing it for many years , and we are doing it successfully .\nthat we and our immune system could cope with relatively well .\nThis is the principle of vaccination as we have been doing it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it successfully .\nthat we and our immune system could cope with relatively well .\nThis is the principle of vaccination as we have been doing it for many years , and we are doing it successfully .\nRM : With the Sars-Cov-2 vaccination to be developed in a very short time , the pharmaceutical industry is now breaking new ground .\nWhat is the new vaccine supposed to do in humans , if it works at some point ?\nDR. HOCKERTZ : I have to admit that making a vaccine can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we ever specialize in influenza , that the influenza vaccine from the year 2020 , which you have now been given , is roughly from the information in 2018 , at most 2019 .\nIt \u2019 s not because the researchers didn \u2019 t know what the 2020 influenza virus looks like , it \u2019 s because it \u2019 s so difficult and it takes so long to make the vaccine .\nI was just saying : It \u2019 s about the chicken egg , that \u2019 s where it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a very , very tedious and costly , especially lengthy production that takes 1 to 2 years to complete \u2013 just the production .\nThat \u2019 s how you are , a long time ago , by the way , came up with an alternative method \u2013 the German company Curevac has been working on this topic for 12 years ( without having obtained successful approval so far ) \u2013 namely a system that only imitates the genetic information of a virus .\nAnd this genetic information \u2013 in this case it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-stranded RNA \u2013 is transported into the cell via a vector system or carrier , similar to a truck that I put on it .\nIt \u2019 s a completely new approach .\nAnd that is now very important information : There is not a single vaccine worldwide on this basis that has been approved .\nSo there is not a single vaccine based on virus mRNA or virus DNA that is transported into a human cell via a vector in order to be read there .\nIt \u2019 s a completely new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 there is no question about that \u2013 because it makes it relatively easy to produce genetic material .\nIt \u2019 s easy and it \u2019 s quick .\nAnd now I speak as a toxicologist .\nThe question that arises is : if I want to develop such a new vaccination strategy ( and that \u2019 s it ) , then I have to know very well about that vaccination strategy .\nI need to know about the distribution of this vaccine in the body , about its function ( pharmacodynamics ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may occur .\nAnd they are varied when I transport genetic material from a virus into a human cell .\nUltimately , this can be done via enzymes \u2013 there is , for example , an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase \u2013 which is able to reproduce these ribonucleic acids , which I have now received virally from the laboratory table into my cell .\nThat is possible .\nAnd this would then lead to And that needs to be checked .\nAnd now we have the situation with this new vaccination strategy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 3 months , and that around this time , in these 3 months , development work was carried out that all of these We are told that already has risks under control and eliminated .\nBecause the Paul Ehrlich Institute , together with an ethics committee of the University of T\u00fcbingen , has allowed 168 people to be treated with this vaccine on a trial basis .\nI do not think that this is right , ethically unjustifiable , because in these 3 months it was simply not possible to collect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine .\nRM : I was just about to ask whether there are ethics councils on the agenda , not just from the University of T\u00fcbingen but from the Federal Republic of Germany and worldwide , to discuss this \u2013 yes , genetic manipulation .\nIn Germany we are not even so generous with genetic manipulation with plants and animals .\nOr are we not talking about genetic manipulation here ?\nDR. HOCKERTZ : If I may go into this question , I am confronted with a tremendous mystery , and ultimately it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our work in the area of \u200b\u200bregulatory affairs , the approval of vaccines .\nYes , the question arises : under what ethical aspect was this clinical study even approved ?\nAnd there I know a statement made by a member of the T\u00fcbingen ethics committee who actually only said : \u201c Well , when I eat a steak , I also ingest genetic material from the cow .\nThat doesn \u2019 t hurt me either .\n\u201d DR. HOCKERTZ : There is a difference , and I can now say it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material orally , digest it in the stomach and then excrete it again , or whether I get it intramuscularly with an artificial transport system so that it is directly \u2013 protected \u2013 comes into my cell and can be read there .\nI am saying this so clearly because I have a feeling that many people who also have to decide which clinical studies to conduct on a Sars-Cov-2 vaccine have been exposed to common sense .\nI asked the Paul Ehrlich Institute how I keep asking various institutions because I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI want to hear arguments .\nAnd I asked the Paul Ehrlich Institute : What has happened in these 3 months , which , based on all of our experience as toxicologists , pharmacologists and immunologists , will definitely take 5 to 6 years ?\nWhat has been done there in 3 months that can otherwise only be done in 5 years ?\nTo ensure the safety of a vaccine , a completely new vaccination strategy , about which we know far too little .\nAnd I haven \u2019 t received an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this question \u2013 and maybe that is a good answer to your question too : \u201c I am of the opinion that we should by no means sacrifice our science , our ethics and our regulatory requirements for the political declarations of intent by ministers and chancellor.\n\u201d And that \u2019 s exactly what happens .\nRM : But we now know that it is being tested .\nWe now know that people have already received a vaccination that works according to this new method .\nDo you already know the results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR. HOCKERTZ : There is the question : what is a result ?\nOn the one hand , of course , we look to see whether this vaccination , i.e .\nthe transport of viral DNA into our own cells , causes a change in our genetic structure , our reading device , up to and including the possibility that this mRNA becomes independent .\nThe rationale behind this is that these cells , our cells , should produce viral material in order to be recognized by our immune system .\nThe original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only measure antibodies .\nAnd that would be proof that this vaccination also works .\nBut we have an immune system that has many different modes of action .\nAnd one mode of action are , for example , cytotoxic T cells ( killer cells ) which now recognize and kill our virus-infected cells .\nAnd these killer cells they are very difficult to prove .\nSo we already have a problem with the rationale of the approach , when we work with viral DNA , of showing whether this vaccination really works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut if I can \u2019 t detect an antibody , it doesn \u2019 t mean it didn \u2019 t work \u2013 it could also be that killer cells were activated .\nThis is a general problem that we know again and again from other vaccinations .\nWhen we vaccinate against hepatitis , we always have a number of patients in whom we can not detect antibodies , although they have protection .\nIt works when I detect antibodies .\nBut if I can \u2019 t detect an antibody , it doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 it could also be that killer cells were activated .\nThis is a general problem that we know again and again from other vaccinations .\nWhen we vaccinate against hepatitis , we always have a number of patients in whom we can not detect antibodies , although they have protection .\nIt works when I detect antibodies .\nBut if I can \u2019 t detect an antibody , it doesn \u2019 t mean it didn \u2019 t work \u2013 it could also be that killer cells were activated .\nThis is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again from other vaccinations .\nWhen we vaccinate against hepatitis , we always have a number of patients in whom we can not detect antibodies , although they have protection .\nBut that is not the danger behind it .\nI want to dwell here on the dangers that were not looked at .\nSo if experiments are carried out on people now , in this case there are now 168 healthy ones , Test persons \u2013 you have to keep in mind that we are dealing with healthy people to whom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get sick in the future , that is the intention of a vaccination .\nThis means that our requirements for this vaccine must be significantly higher than , for example , requirements for therapeutic treatment .\nWith therapeutic treatment , people are already sick and in case of doubt they can die if I don \u2019 t treat them , so I can accept major side effects and major problems as part of the risk assessment .\nBut if I do a risk assessment for a vaccine , then it should hardly harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy person who only possibly can get sick .\nThe risk assessment of a vaccine must be significantly higher .\nWhat is the risk of this vaccine if I give it to people ?\nThe transportation system I was talking about is contaminated .\nIn the pharmacological sense , it is already called contaminated when it is 99 % pure .\nEven if I only have 1 % contamination , then such a preparation is already \u201c dirty \u201d .\nRM : What does it mean exactly ?\nWhere is the pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material ?\nOr what is the impurity ?\nDR. HOCKERTZ : The active material , ie the RNA , can be produced relatively cleanly .\nBut this must be protected because our body has very active systems to kill or destroy this material extracellularly .\nThat also makes sense because the body wants to protect itself from free RNA being in the body .\nFor example , if cells were to break , RNA would also be released .\nThat is why the RNA that is now being produced in the laboratory has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd these are nanosomes or liposomes , these are lipids , these are envelopes , and these are to be regarded as an impurity per se , because they are a type of dosage form .\nAnd from our experience , these nanosomes , liposomes , are very difficult to actually produce highly pure .\nWhy does the whole thing have to be extremely pure ?\nBecause we don \u2019 t have a so-called no-effect level in the immune system .\nThat means that we don \u2019 t have an area in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system doesn \u2019 t recognize that , that is subliminal .\nThat means we have to look very carefully at what we are offering the immune system together with a genetic material .\nThat takes time , that requires toxicological expertise .\nAnd in my opinion that has not happened so far due to lack of time .\nRM : That \u2019 s the one problem .\nNow I would like to summarize it again in very simple words , and please tell me whether I have understood correctly : This RNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these cells change in such a way that they are then mainly recognized by our immune system that action will be taken against them .\nBut now these are the body \u2019 s own cells .\nHow do I know how far these reproduce ?\nDR. HOCKERTZ : It is unknown .\nThat \u2019 s exactly a question I \u2019 m asking : to what extent do we actually have this genetic material from the virus under control .\nBasically , we do nothing other than imitate a virus infection , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we transport a gene snippet into the cell .\nWe do not know what exactly happens to this gene snippet .\nWe have hopes there .\nWe have the hope that this snippet of genes will be read by the ribosomes , and that proteins will be produced and shown again on the surface of the cell , faking a virus-infected cell .\nAfter that , this gene snippet should be switched off and not reappear .\nThis is our hope but that has not been proven .\nTherefore , the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happens to the genetic material which I with an artificial transport system in a human cell into it transported ?\nFor the first time .\nThat has never been done before .\nWhat happens to the material ?\nIs that being duplicated ?\nIt is biologically possible for it to reproduce .\nWill it be built into a plasmid ?\nThat is also theoretically possible .\nRM : What does that mean ?\nDR. HOCKERTZ : This means that it is then still present outside the nucleus as a gene snippet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherited becomes .\nDo these gene snippets only get into the muscle cells ?\nOr are they so well protected that they can eventually get into the germ line \u2013 that is , into the woman \u2019 s egg cells and the man \u2019 s sperm cells ?\nThen this gene snippet would even be inherited for our offspring .\nNone of that has been clarified .\nI am only requesting that this be done in lengthy , complex examinations that I am familiar with .\nBut when I hear from our politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will have this vaccine made available to 80 million people , then a horror scenario opens up to me where I say : none of these questions have been answered at all , and could not can not be answered at all because we have only been able to work on the topic for 3 or 4 months .\nRM : You work in drug testing .\nI would now like to know the normal procedure , before Corona , from you , how such a development normally works .\nYou can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of subjects be ?\nIs a double-blind study being carried out , i.e .\nthe highest current scientific standard ?\nAnd then : How long do you have to test for effects or side effects ?\nAnd when and how can they even show themselves ?\nDR. HOCKERTZ : Every vaccine development , and every development of a drug , begins with preclinical development , i.e .\neverything that goes before takes place with humans in order to ensure the safety of such a product before it even comes into contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cell cultures , then also on animals , in order to show early on : How is the vaccine distributed in the body ?\nWe don \u2019 t even look at the effect at first .\nAt first we only look for security .\nIn a second aspect , the effect is also looked at .\nAnimals are also vaccinated accordingly and then a look is taken : With which test system can I prove the success of this vaccination ?\nWhat proof of effectiveness can I carry out ?\nWith a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take about 3 to 4 years , depending on how stringently these studies are carried out and how often they have to be repeated .\nOnly then do we get a permit , usually after 3 to 4 years , to allow a first experiment on humans .\nWe call this a phase 1 study , and it is usually relatively small in order to keep the risk for humans relatively low .\nThat is mostly only 20 to 30 subjects , and not 160 , as is now the case .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine , but they are only examined briefly and it is checked : What kind of one do I have acute difficulty \u2013 do you develop a fever or other side effects ?\nI can \u2019 t even pay attention to long-term effects in this phase 1 study .\nBut in this area I look at which acute side effects can occur there .\nIf these are already too big , that \u2019 s the end of this vaccine again .\nIf they are justifiable , i.e .\nmaybe just reddening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can continue for the time being , but of course still with a high risk .\nThat is why we then go into a so-called phase 2 and phase 3 clinical study .\nThe phase 3 clinical study is then the blind or double-blind study you mentioned .\nThat is , always provided with a placebo , where neither the test person nor the doctor know which test person has received the actual vaccine and which has not .\nThis is to protect us from interpreting too much \u2013 that \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we expect , but that we can actually evaluate the effectiveness but also the safety of this vaccine completely free of evaluation , only statistically .\nA follow-up period for these vaccines is usually 2 years .\nThis is roughly the time in which you can see whether long-term damage can actually occur , so-called vaccination damage .\nThis follow-up period is usually set for 2 years to show that you are really on the safe side , that you are not harming people , but only using the vaccination .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , phase 1 , 2 and 3 studies , double-blind , together with the preclinical , we would have a total time horizon of around 8 years , after which we would go from the first preclinical examination to for approval of the vaccine state-of-the-art can actually make this available to people with a clear conscience .\nRM : Is there actually something like reviews for pharmaceutical studies , as with scientific studies or other scientific publications ?\nSo that others can then check this development and research ?\nDR. HOCKERTZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science to keep reflecting our own data that we have with other science , and that the whole thing takes place peer-reviewed .\nThis is sometimes difficult to do for reasons of confidentiality , because that \u2019 s how I \u2019 m competing .\nIn the case of vaccine development , however , something like this is basically common , because of course we want and have to make use of the broad knowledge of science in order to guarantee the safety of people .\nRM : So in this case not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , when we address the Corona case , there is no diversity of opinion anyway .\nWe have had to experience this painfully in the last 4 months .\nThat opinions are not only not heard but also suppressed .\nAs the last , very current example , I can now quote a podcast by Markus Langemann / Langemann Medien , which I ran 3 days ago , and which was banned from Youtube today and was deleted .\nThis is not a diversity of opinion .\nRM : Now another question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pharmaceutical industry earlier : Where is the furthest development now ?\nWho is the one who \u2019 s already testing ?\nAnd do the others stop right now because it \u2019 s too late anyway ?\nOr how does it work in the normal pharmaceutical business ?\nDR. HOCKERTZ : The market , especially for the Sars-Cov-2 vaccination , is so huge that the 1 company can not guarantee that it would be hopelessly overdone .\nLook , the BMI ( Federal Ministry of the Interior ) and Mr. Spahn have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million vaccine doses from a vaccine that has not yet been approved .\nIt has to be produced , it has to be properly packaged , according to good manufacturing practice .\nIt has to be safe and orderly , and always understandable .\nI am aware of the Moderna company that they are already conducting clinical studies on test subjects , I will leave out the word \u201c voluntary \u201d test subjects \u2013 they are test subjects .\nI \u2019 m not sure where they come from , there is a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are supposed to be soldiers , and maybe it \u2019 s not that far when it comes to voluntariness .\nIn Germany , it is the company Curevac and the company Biontech that have been dealing with this issue for many years \u2013 and that \u2019 s perfectly fine \u2013 to get market share here by making this vaccine available at an early stage .\nBut with the comprehensive necessity , as it is conveyed to us through politics \u2013 a very important point \u2013 is conveyed by rulers , who even talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so huge that there is more space than just one company .\nThis means that even if Moderna is now starting the clinical studies and can also show initial successes , other companies will continue to work on the topic and follow suit , because the market is basically still big enough for many , many companies .\nEspecially because there may be a compulsory ordinance that 80 million people or 83 million people in Germany should be vaccinated \u2013 the subject is not off the table .\nAnd of course that holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the topic and follow suit , because the market is basically still big enough for many , many companies .\nEspecially because there may be a compulsory ordinance that 80 million people or 83 million people in Germany should be vaccinated \u2013 the subject is not off the table .\nAnd of course that holds other companies will continue to work on the topic and follow suit , because the market is basically still big enough for many , many companies .\nEspecially because there may be a compulsory ordinance that 80 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be vaccinated \u2013 the subject is not off the table .\nAnd of course that holds especially high risks , if I may say so .\nIf I only vaccinate a few people and accept a percentage of the vaccine damage , then that still has to be given a very careful risk assessment , but you can make and estimate such a risk assessment and then think about it , that is ethical reasonable or not .\nBut if I , and I follow the numbers \u2013 I am now often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from \u2013 then I follow the figures given by a Mr. Gates , whom I don \u2019 t like to quote , but in that case I \u2019 ll do it \u2013 If we assume that even 5 % , and that is a relatively small number of people who are vaccinated , show vaccine damage , then for 80 million people that is 4 million people who show vaccine damage .\nIf I am responsible for this vaccine damage because I made the first examinations far too short , then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically injured .\nI can of course reduce vaccination damage or reduce the risk of vaccination damage if I only do this long enough and sensibly state-of-the-art testing of this vaccine according to the regulatory requirements .\nIf I don \u2019 t , then resolution is involved .\nThen this is willful assault .\nIf I talk about 80 million people \u2013 these are also numbers that come from this corner \u2013 with a death rate from vaccination of 0.1 % , then I have to answer : 80,000 deaths from vaccination if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That \u2019 s a number we can \u2019 t really imagine , 80,000 dead .\nPerhaps this can be imagined by saying : This is the city of Konstanz or the city of Bamberg that is being wiped out .\nRM : And these are the normal mortality rates with a vaccination ?\nDR. HOCKERTZ : It \u2019 s hard to say , it varies from vaccination to vaccination .\nWhen we talk about pneumococcal or meningococcal vaccinations , for example ( meningococcal vaccinations are better there ) , then I have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nwhen people are struggling with another infection at the same time .\nThis is always a great difficulty with forced vaccinations anyway , that I have to look at each individual case anamnestically : Does this person currently have an infection ?\nDoes the other have problems with the immune system ?\nBecause a vaccination always puts a strain on the immune system .\nIf we look at the meningococcal vaccination , then it is certainly risky .\nHere , too , we have mortality rates that should be well below 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it depends on the anamnesis of the people .\nWe see a sad example of how high mortality rates from meningococcal vaccinations can be in connection with Corona : In Bergamo , 35,000 people \u2013 data from the ISS in Italy \u2013 were forcibly vaccinated in January after a meningococcal epidemic in January .\nThat alone was basically a mistake , because this vaccination naturally goes hand in hand with the flu season , i.e .\na time when we keep coming into contact with viruses \u2013 whether flu viruses or coronaviruses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be avoided .\nAnd every third semester student learns that meningococcal vaccination is risky , especially if there is a risk of contracting another viral infection .\nObviously this has now happened , and we will see the result in Bergamo : very , very high death rates among people \u2013 from Corona , as was said .\nI say : with Corona \u2013 but ultimately caused by this negligent implementation of a forced vaccination against meningococci .\nThis means that a basic death rate / danger rate actually depends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short- and long-term vaccine damage that can occur .\nBut we know that we have to be very careful with people , because we are making great demands on their immune system through the vaccination , and therefore have to be very careful in development .\nAnd I demand this care .\nAnd this care is obviously not being done at the moment .\nThe point is actually that we try again and again , now also at Paul-Ehrlich , to access scientific data , scientific statements of the acting and advisory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask : Please give us dates , please give us arguments , with which we can grapple so that we can also reflect our view against it .\nWewant to go into the scientific discourse .\nBut we don \u2019 t get anything .\nRM : But you are usually in constant contact with the Paul Ehrlich Institute , right ?\nDR. HOCKERTZ : I have a lot of exchanges with the Paul Ehrlich Institute , and I know a number of people there .\nI am deliberately not giving names now .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , a lot , by many people : \u201c It \u2019 s a catastrophe , what \u2019 s going on here , \u201d they tell me .\n\u201c The way we are influenced is a disaster .\nHow this vaccine is supposed to get approved here is a disaster .\nWe can \u2019 t support that .\n\u201d Then I say : \u201c Yes , go outside !\nSay it !\nSpeak up !\n\u201c And then there is always a very big fear : \u201d No , I can \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @

\u2018Arbitrary\u2019 Lockdown to March", "content": "Tens of thousands of businesses and millions of students \u2019 hopes were dashed last night after Boris Johnson just extended COVID lockdown until March 8th , with the PM confirming that schools and all \u201c non-essential \u201d businesses will remain shut .\nThe justification for this seems to be as shaky as ever .\nOn one hand , Johnson warns of a \u2018 perilous situation , \u2019 while simultaneously claiming that the government still sees \u201c signs \u201d that infections rates are slowing .\nAs a result of this constant real-time flip-flopping \u2013 no one really knows what \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed by pseudo science .\nUndoubtedly , Johnson \u2019 s delay in reopening schools will have half-destroyed yet another year of education for the nation \u2019 s children , and it \u2019 s been reported that kids have already missed approximately 110 school school days out of a possible 190 since the reactionary lockdown polices were implemented last March 2020 .\nThese are are formative education years which children will never get back .\nThis latest move by the PM extends the national lockdown to 9 weeks , and will most certainly crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be hinting that pubs and restaurants may likely to be closed for longer .\nSupposedly , the Government will be rolling out yet another master plan in late February , no doubt some new and creative \u2018 Tiered system \u2019 which will be sold to the public as a \u2018 gradual and phased \u2019 roadmap out of lockdown .\nSince the new year , the new talking point has been about various and sundry \u2018 new variants \u2019 which are allegely more transmissible and more deadly , although no actual scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and media hypothesis on their \u2018 variant \u2019 theory .\nSEE ALSO : UK \u2018 Variant Fears \u2019 Are Over-Hyped Says Leading US Microbiologist \u201c It was the emergence of a new variant that forced England back into lockdown and I know everyone yearns to know how much longer we must endure these restrictions .\nWe will not persist for a day longer than is necessary but nor can we relax too soon , because if we do we run the risk of our NHS coming under still greater pressure , compelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those restrictions for longer , \u201d said Johnson .\nHowever , the answer to why Johnson has decided to increase economic pain and social suffering may be more pragmatic .\nWhen speaking to MP \u2019 s he was quoted as saying that , \u201c The reason we say 8 March is the earliest is we have to give a certain amount of time for the vaccine to bed in.\n\u201d \u201c We also need to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine in driving down the number of deaths , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of February.\n\u201d This statement reinforces suspicion many of the critics have that this external lockdown was , and always has been about the dissemination of corporate vaccine products .\n\u201c There are still too many unknowns regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine in stopping transmission and the speed at which its roll-out will reduce hospitalisations , according to the PM , reported the Metro .\nJohnson claims that the current lockdown which began on January 4 , has somehow reduced the fungible \u2018 R number \u2019 ( correctly referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naught \u201d ) , but then says the lockdown still can \u2019 t be lifted because it \u2019 s supposedly \u2018 too early \u2019 to tell \u2019 , and they can be sure if it \u2019 s \u2018 safe \u2019 to reopen society and the economy .\nJudging by the predictably fluid and elastic nature of this government \u2019 s approach to what is now an arbitrary policy , it \u2019 s almost certain that Boris Johnson will continue to move the goals posts and may likely extend the lockdown again up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WINTER FUNDRAISING DRIVE HERE", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

"date": "2021-01-29", "source": "21stcenturywire", "title": "REPORT: New US President, Same Old Foreign Policy", "content": "From Whence Power Flows : Corporate-Funded Think Tanks Another election .\nAnother political transition .\nAnother opportunity for the US to change course regarding its otherwise destructive foreign policy ?\nContrary to popular belief , US foreign policy is not the product of the nation \u2019 s elected representatives nor is it overseen by the occupants of the White House .\nUS foreign policy is instead driven by unelected corporate-financier interests .\nThese include some of the largest , most powerful corporations and financial institutions on Earth , in human history like JP Morgan , Google , Bank of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AT & T , Citigroup , Microsoft , Verizon , Johnson & Johnson , Chevron , PepsiCo , Pfizer , Goldman Sachs , Amazon , Merck , Lockheed , Boeing , Monsanto , and GM just to name a few .\nThey create consensus within and across industries , the political landscape , and within mass media through a network of policy think tanks they fund and chair like the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , the Brookings Institution , the RAND Corporation , the Center for Strategic and International Studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council .\nThe policy proposed by these think tanks is transformed into bills , sent to Washington with lobbyists , where it is then rubber stamped often with little or no debate and often without US representatives even reading the bills before signing them .\nThis helps explain why US foreign policy regarding its Transatlantic relations , its confrontation with Russia , its military campaigns stretching from North Africa , through the Middle East , and into Central Asia , as well as its policy of encirclement and containment versus China continues regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupies the White House \u2013 often with particular policies being pursued seamlessly not only from one president to the next , but often from one decade to another .\nLikewise \u2013 the connections these think tanks have with Western media helps explain the singular narratives we see when it is time for the media to sell pre-determined policy to the American public as well as to international audiences .\nThus , in order to understand US foreign policy , one must understand the corporations and financial institutions that truly shape it , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclivities of those in Washington merely signing off on this policy .\nUnderstanding what US President Joe Biden will do over the next four years is not a matter of examining his own alleged political platform , his campaign promises , or even what he says on a day-to-day basis \u2013 but rather understanding what policy he will be tasked with continuing and understanding that the former are designed to serve as a pretext for perpetuating the latter .\nIf we find that Biden \u2019 s administration is set to continue US foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the past 4 years under US President Donald Trump \u2013 with only minor differences in window dressing , this is the reason we should not be surprised .\nWe can fully expect US foreign policy \u2013 from US relations with Europe and Russia , from Africa to the Middle East , and front Central to East Asia to continue as it has for decades in pursuit of hegemony with political rhetoric used as camouflage , not an actual reflection of real motivation or agenda .\nIn fact , President Biden \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blinken , has already made it abundantly clear that not only will the new administration continue US foreign policy in the same direction \u2013 including finishing or adding to projects undertaken over the past 4 years under Trump \u2013 but it fully plans to accelerate it in every dimension possible .\nAmerica \u2019 s Transatlantic policy is rooted in the geopolitical architecture created at the end of World War II and cemented into place during the decades of the Cold War versus first the Soviet Union and now the Russian Federation which emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia has historically played a direct role in the Great Power Competition \u2013 sometimes as an ally of Western European powers , but almost always as a competitor , and even sometimes as a potential target for colonization itself .\nThe Soviet Union \u2019 s emergence after World War II as a global superpower \u2013 owed to the massive military might it accrued during its fighting against Nazi Germany \u2013 posed a direct threat to US and Western European designs for the continuation of their respective overseas ambitions \u2013 including reasserting themselves over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East to Southeast Asia and even China .\nThe Cold War \u2013 driven by what US President Dwight Einsenhower referred to as the \u201c military industrial complex \u201d saw to prevent any sort of accommodation or compromise amid this process of the West reasserting its global primacy .\nAs part of this process the US and special interests across Western Europe attempted to suppress elements within Western society that might seek to cooperate rather than seek conflict with the Soviet Union and its allies .\nOperation Gladio \u2013 a network of clandestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provocations that would be pinned on Soviet-linked groups \u2013 fomenting conflict and preventing cooperation between East and West .\nMore recently , this has translated into what many are calling the \u201c New Cold War \u201d \u2013 this time not the US and NATO against the Soviet Union \u2013 but between the US and sympathetic circles in Western Europe along with a growing list of client regimes in Eastern Europe against the Russian Federation .\nIt was the US who after the collapse of the Soviet Union used \u201c color revolutions \u201d to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian Federation \u2013 including in areas previously part of the Soviet Union .\nIt was a process that began under US President Bill Clinton , continued under George Bush , and saw a significant resurgence under Obama in 2013 and 2014 when US-backed opposition groups overthrew the government of Ukraine .\nIt was also around the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union that the US supported Chechen terrorists and their goal of creating an independent state in Russia \u2019 s North Caucasus region .\nThe Second Chechen War would unfold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia still to this day managing the region carefully to police extremism .\nDespite the promise of a \u201c Restart \u201d between Washington and Moscow under the US President Barack Obama \u2013 a campaign of confrontation and subversion was executed against Russia as it began to rise again on the global stage as a serious international player .\nJust as was the case during the Cold War \u2013 significant investments have been made to create networks to ensure Western Europe remains on a confrontational footing with modern day Russia rather than move in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways we have seen this process fail \u2013 and nations like Germany pursuing major deals with Russia including the Nord Stream 2 pipeline .\nIt is a pipeline that connects Russia directly to Western Europe via Germany \u2013 bypassing any nation the US could potentially create unrest in \u2013 like it did in Ukraine in 2013-2014 .\nAs part of Washington \u2019 s goal to isolate Russia , it adamantly opposes the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and any prospect of Russia working closer in collaboration with Western Europe .\nDespite the obvious self-serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has tried to camouflage it by claiming its desire to obstruct Nord Stream 2 is rooted in concerns over Europe \u2019 s \u201c energy security \u201d \u2013 implying that Europe \u2013 and Germany specifically \u2013 is unable to recognize the threat itself .\nThe US has \u2013 just as it did in the Cold War \u2013 demonstrated its willingness to attack \u201c allies \u201d as enthusiastically as it attacks its enemies \u2013 leveling sanctions against German companies involved in Nord Stream 2 \u2019 s construction .\nThe orchestration of staged events is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today .\nThe alleged poisoning of US-backed Russian opposition figure Alexy Navalny and his \u201c coincidental \u201d evacuation flight to Germany was accompanied by very public statements by the Western media and European politicians calling on the German government to cancel Nord Stream 2 in light of the Kremlin \u2019 s supposed assassination attempt .\nGerman state media , Deutsche Welle ( DW ) , would note in their article , \u201c European Parliament calls for halt on Nord Stream 2 construction after Navalny arrest , \u201d that : Clearly Moscow stood nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly unpopular opposition figure in Russia \u2013 especially at a time when Nord Stream 2 is so close to completion .\nIt is also abundantly clear that the US stood everything to gain .\nWhen the ploy failed to deter Germany \u2013 pressure and sanctions targeting Germany directly were increased \u2013 first under Trump \u2013 and now under Biden .\nBoth under Trump and now Biden \u2013 similar calls have been made .\nDuring Secretary Blinken \u2019 s confirmation hearing , he agreed with Senator Ted Cruz over the \u201c necessity \u201d to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions including additional sanctions and pressure including on Germany itself were on the table .\nWorse still Blinken found himself arguing with US Senator Rand Paul over why he believed NATO should be further expanded to include Georgia and Ukraine \u2013 part of a much more aggressive method of encircling and isolating Russia \u2013 a method of expanding NATO toward Russia \u2019 s very borders that has been pursued by every US president since the fall of the Soviet Union .\nFrom the 1990s when US \u201c color revolutions \u201d were honed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc of client states around Russia \u2019 s peripheries \u2013 to today where Ukraine remains destabilized and Belarus , directly on Russia \u2019 s border , faces similar US-backed destabilization \u2013 it remains clear that regardless of who is in the White House a singular agenda is pursued against Russia \u2013 and when necessary \u2013 against European \u201c allies \u201d who impede this singular agenda .\nVirtually every aspect of US foreign policy in regards to North Africa and the Middle East also stretches back to the end of World War 2 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the two regions ever since .\nThe overthrow of the Libyan government in 2011 was a project one US president after another oversaw since at least as early as the 1980s \u2013 and in particular \u2013 through the use of extremists funded and armed clandestinely by the US government .\nThe overthrow of the Iraqi government spanned from the time of US President George Bush Sr. to his son George W. Bush , culminating in the 2003 US invasion of Iraq \u2013 and has resulted in an enduring US occupation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of the Obama administration , all 4 years of the Trump administration , and very unlikely to end under Biden who has expressed no plans \u2013 even on the campaign trail \u2013 to end America \u2019 s military presence in the region .\nLikewise for Syria \u2013 the US has sought to remove the Syrian government from power since Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad \u2019 s father held the office .\nThe 2011 proxy invasion of Syria began under Obama and continued under Trump , and under the new President Biden , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 with no plans of leaving any time soon .\nYemen faces a similar and enduring conflict driven by US interests and through US and European support for aggressors including Saudi Arabia , Qatar , the UAE , and others .\nThe current conflict in Yemen \u2013 like in Syria \u2013 began in 2011 under the Obama administration as a component of the US-engineered \u201c Arab Spring \u201d and evolved into a violent war from 2015 onward \u2013 backed by the US and executed by Washington \u2019 s regional allies including Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif meet in 2016 ( Image Credit : Kevin Lamarque/Reuters at CFR ) Together , America \u2019 s various wars , proxy wars , and occupations across the Middle East aim at encircling , containing , and eventually collapsing the government of Iran .\nIran \u2013 a target of US aggression since the 1970s \u2013 has likewise faced decades-spanning plans pushed forward seamlessly from one US administration to the next .\nThe clearest example of this was the Joint Comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also known as the \u201c Iran Nuclear Deal.\n\u201d While it was signed in 2013 during the Obama administration \u2013 a 2009 policy paper published by the above mentioned Brookings Institution entitled , \u201c Which Path to Persia ?\n: Options for a New American Strategy Toward Iran \u201d made it clear that the US intended to betray the deal , shift the blame on Iran , and use the resulting crisis as a pretext to pursue further aggression with what US policymakers believed would be greater international support .\nThis was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal proposed and signed under Obama , broken under Trump , with the US left precariously close to war with Iran under Biden .\nWhile many have held on to hopes that Biden will return the US to the Iran Nuclear Deal \u2013 it should be noted that US foreign policy in places like Syria including the US-engineered proxy war waged while Biden was Vice President \u2013 was ultimately designed as one part of a wider strategy against Iran itself .\nIt was also noted in the 2009 Brookings Institution paper that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way before any direct confrontation with Iran could be pursued .\nNot only did Biden play a role in attempting to remove Syria as part of this prerequisite \u2013 it was his current US Secretary of State Antony Blinken who \u2013 then Deputy Secretary of State under Obama \u2013 helped perpetuate that proxy war .\nThe US proxy war in Syria ( and Yemen ) , along with the continued US military presence in Iraq , is directly linked to US aggression ( and planned aggression ) against Iran .\nThe idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal and offering a genuine path out of US-Iranian tensions \u2013 and for Iran \u2013 a path out from under US sanctions is at this juncture an impossibility .\nOne of several likely scenarios that will come into play will be Israeli belligerence \u201c sabotaging \u201d the deal .\nThe 2009 Brookings paper repeatedly cites Israel as a useful provocateur that could help goad Iran into a war or carry out highly unpopular and extremely illegal acts of aggression that might prompt an Iranian response and open the door to direct US military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden to \u201c appear \u201d willing to salvage the Iran Nuclear Deal only to have Israel spoil it and leave the US \u201c no choice \u201d but to reluctantly back its Israeli allies .\nHelping set the stage for this narrative is Biden appearing to backtrack on some of Trump \u2019 s more aggressively supportive policies regarding Israel \u2013 backtracking Israel could use as a pretext for stepping out on its \u201c own \u201d despite virtually every aspect of its military capabilities in the region being tightly integrated with the US \u2019 own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showmanship , Blinken during his confirmation hearing when questioned by Senator Lindsey Graham would affirm his belief that Iran remains the \u201c largest state sponsor of terror \u201d in the world today \u2013 a label that will make it impossible to ever genuinely offer a path out of conflict with Iran .\nAgain \u2013 we see that regardless of who has been president over the last 30 years or so \u2013 US foreign policy in the region continues along a singular path , driven by a singular hegemonic agenda .\nFor centuries Afghanistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s largest and most powerful nations has made it a tempting target for empire .\nThe US war in Afghanistan \u2013 starting in 2001 and continuing to this day has placed thousands of US troops and an extensive network of military facilities on the doorsteps of Iran , Russia and its peripheries , Pakistan , and China with whom Afghanistan also shares a section of its border .\nThe US occupation creates the perfect conditions to promote and export radicalism in all directions \u2013 into the territory of each of America \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves as a base for US military capabilities that can be projected in any direction if and when necessary .\nThe flow of drugs , money , weapons , and fighters ( and accompanying extremism ) through Afghanistan ensures US-backed militancy in Pakistan \u2019 s southwest Balochistan region , Iran \u2019 s Sistan and Baluchestan Province , China \u2019 s Xinjiang region , and post-Soviet Central Asia remains a constant threat .\nIt is a threat that conveniently overlaps China \u2019 s One Belt , One Road ( OBOR ) initiative \u2013 including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit routes through Xinjiang , China .\nAnd because Afghanistan is occupied by US troops \u2013 the prospects of any of the nations impacted by extremism and instability emanating from Afghanistan intervening in any way and affecting stability in Afghanistan remains unlikely .\nBiden \u2019 s Secretary of State Antony Blinken would affirm during his confirmation hearing when questioned by Senator Lindsey Graham that a withdrawal from Afghanistan was not likely or conducive to US interests .\nOf course \u2013 extremism in part exported from Afghanistan into China \u2019 s Xinjiang region is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing encirclement and containment of China .\nTo the south the US has used Tibet as a focal point of separatism and a source of political pressure to exert on Beijing since the 1950s .\nThe US has for decades up to and including today attempted to shape political outcomes in Southeast Asia in order to stitch together a united front against China .\nThis includes through the use of \u201c soft power \u201d and \u201c color revolutions \u201d in which the US builds up opposition groups and even political parties to seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US , rather than local and regional interests .\nThailand \u2013 at the writing of this article \u2013 is in the middle of months of US-funded anti-government protests targeting the nation \u2019 s current government , the nation \u2019 s military , and its constitutional monarchy .\nThais historically credit the monarchy \u2013 an institution over seven centuries old \u2013 for Thailand \u2019 s status as the only Southeast Asian nation to avoid Western colonization .\nIt is clear why the US would seek to undermine and remove it if its goal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now leaning heavily in China \u2019 s direction \u2013 and install a client regime eager to reverse that .\nThailand along with many Southeast Asia countries counts China as their largest trading partner , investor , source of tourism , and partner in both the development and acquisition of military technology as well as in the development of infrastructure projects including high-speed rail , power production , and communication networks .\nThe creation and cultivation of US-backed opposition in Southeast Asia is a process that has spanned multiple presidencies .\nIt was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Democracy ( NED ) funded fronts were founded and began their subversive work in Southeast Asia .\nIt was under Obama that the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative ( YSEALI ) was created to begin creating US-backed cadres of politically-active youths in a bid to transform Southeast Asia into a Western-leaning enclave .\nAlso under Obama we would see the US-funded and orchestrated protests in Hong Kong begin in the form of \u201c Occupy Central \u201d and the \u201c Umbrella Revolution.\n\u201d These protests would continue into the Trump administration where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring \u201d inspired \u201c Asia Spring \u201d which included US-backed anti-Chinese movements in Taiwan , the Philippines , Malaysia , and Thailand \u2013 some of which took to the streets including in Thailand .\nThe protests ended in Hong Kong \u2013 but only because of the National Security Law and its strict enforcement .\nThe protests directly linked to them in Thailand continue and are likely to do so until similar laws are passed by the Thai government .\nUS efforts to complicate the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China have also continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president .\nIt was under Obama that the US National Endowment for Democracy established a franchise in Taipei called the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy .\nOne of Trump \u2019 s parting gestures before leaving office was lifting restriction on contacts between US officials and the government in Taiwan .\nIt was a gesture US Secretary of State Blinken has vowed during his confirmation hearing to uphold and finalize .\nThe BBC in its article , \u201c Pompeo : US to lift restrictions on contacts with Taiwan , \u201d would explain : Taiwan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the US \u2013 as part of China under the \u201c One China Policy.\n\u201d Despite officially recognizing the One China Policy , Washington has undermined it at every juncture and regardless of who occupies either Congress or the White House .\nUnder the Biden administration , the US will most certainly continue its belligerence toward China regarding Taiwan with the new Secretary of State vowing as much during his confirmation hearing before the US Senate .\nThe South China Sea is another pressure point the US is using against China .\nAttempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South China Sea and transform them into a regional and even international conflict have been ongoing since the Obama administration and the so-called US \u201c pivot to Asia.\n\u201d A 2011 piece by then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Foreign Policy titled , \u201c America \u2019 s Pafic Century \u201d would specifically refer to \u201c defending freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.\n\u201d It was also under the Obama administration that the US organized an international tribunal on behalf of the Philippines over its disputes with China over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d court unsurprisingly sided with the US lawyers and delivered the Philippines a favorable verdict \u2013 but Manila refused to use it as leverage against China and opted for bilateral negotiations instead .\nThe South China Sea \u2013 just like the Nord Stream 2 pipeline \u2013 is transformed into an imaginary crisis to serve as a pretext for US interference in the region \u2013 oftentimes at the cost of the very nations it claims it is attempting to \u201c aid.\n\u201d A similar scenario plays out on the Korean Peninsula with South Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems allegedly put in place to counter threats from North Korea \u2013 but obviously as part of Washington \u2019 s agenda of ringing both Russia and China with such missile systems .\nAnd all the way across the Pacific back to the Americas \u2013 US foreign policy even in its own \u201c backyard \u201d has moved seamlessly from one administration to the next \u2013 with US-backed regime change efforts in Venezuela the clearest example of all .\nThe failed coup against Hugo Chavez in 2002 engineered under the administration of George Bush \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 8 years under Obama , through to the declaration and backing of Juan Guido as \u201c president \u201d under Trump \u2013 it is unlikely that with Biden now as president anything of substance is going to change in the Americas as well \u2013 with Secretary of State Blinken already affirming the administration will continue to recognize US-backed proxy Juan Guiado as \u201c president.\n\u201d Not only does US foreign policy in each region of the world continue seamlessly regardless of who sits at the helm in Washington \u2013 the policies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next .\nIn many instances , US foreign policy across multiple regions serves toward the primary goal of encircling and containing the vast territory of both Russia and China .\nUltimately this is not just about encircling and containing the physical territory of Russia and China \u2013 but rather containing and eliminating interests competing with the unelected interests in the West driving US foreign policy .\nGiant corporations like Boeing and Lockheed see China \u2019 s COMAC as a future threat .\nThis \u2013 and not Trump \u2019 s whims \u2013 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US sanctions .\nThe same could be said for Huawei vis-a-vis US tech giants like Apple .\nThere is of course a profit motivation behind perpetual , unending war driven by a continuity of agenda in Washington all in and of itself \u2013 but the primary goal is preserving Western corporate-financier hegemony worldwide and eliminating competition wherever and whenever it emerges through any means up to and including military aggression .\nPolicies that seem disconnected from geopolitics \u2013 like America \u2019 s role in monetizing \u201c climate change \u201d \u2013 can quickly seep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narratives serving it .\nA similar scenario is unfolding as part of the US pharmaceutical industry \u2019 s role in creating and compounding the COVID-19 socioeconomic crisis .\nIt is clear that this brand of geopolitics \u2013 while viable shortly after World War 2 and well into the Cold War \u2013 is no longer sustainable .\nBut it will be the shifting of the global balance of power that forces US policy to change \u2013 not a president or a member of Congress coming to this realization , nor any campaign promises made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any guide , the US will stubbornly resist this shifting balance of power even to

that elected US official are largely above the law on this issue , and have been allowed to amass personal fortunes for years on the back of their public office .\nHow has this situation been allowed to persist in a country which likes to market itself internationally as a transparent and pristine democracy ?\nThis situation has come to a head again this week , after the Democratic Party \u2019 s House leader Nancy Pelosi made some rather convenient stock purchases last month \u2013 which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethics and legality of Congresspeople buying and selling corporate shares which are directly affected by government announcements and laws which those same elected officials have advanced knowledge of , and in some cases , are directly involved in the decision-making which determines the policies and laws in question , which drive up share prices .\nBack in December , Nancy Pelosi ( who has managed to amass a personal family fortune of around $ 150 million during her time in Congress ) purchased 25 call options of Tesla stock , along with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behold , the Biden administration suddenly announced its \u2018 environmental \u2019 agenda which featured various government programs and incentives designed to boost the electric car market .\nThere is no question that Pelosi and her husband ( and who knows who else connected with her and the party ) have benefit financially from these trades and the policy moves which drive the markets .\nThis is corruption on an epic scale .\nWhat can be done ?\nWill anything be done ?\nCan government regulators or mainstream media hold Pelosi and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insider trading ?\nPresident Joe Biden is currently encouraging the purchase of electric vehicles , and that could mean lifting the cap on sales , providing tax credits to buyers , and a potential program incentivizing people to trade in used vehicles to buy an electric one .\nBiden also announced on Monday that he would be replacing the entire fleet of 645,000 federal vehicles with electric ones .\nThis could create a conflict of interest , as part of Pelosi \u2019 s job will include working to pass these environmental and clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family now stands to profit handsomely .\nAccording to the disclosure , Pelosi ( or her husband , Paul , who runs a venture capital firm ) purchased call options at a stake price of $ 500 .\nSince the calls were bought last month , shares of Tesla have risen from $ 640.34 to over $ 890 .\nThe call options are now valued at $ 1.12 ; they were purchased for between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million .\nQuestions of whether it \u2019 s ethical for members of Congress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLast year , former Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler was accused of insider trading and profiting off the coronavirus pandemic when she sold between $ 1.275 million and $ 3.1 million in stocks right after being briefed in January 2020 about the seriousness of the virus .\nIn June of 2020 , the investigation was dismissed by a Senate ethics panel .\nAnd since then , Loeffler lost her seat in the Senate to Democrat Raphael Warnock .\nAnother former Georgia Senator , David Perdue , was also criticized for potentially unethical stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress .\nThe Republican was investigated by the Justice Department for his stock market activity , though no wrongdoing was found ( he , too , lost his recent re-election campaign to a Democrat , Jon Ossoff ) .\nIn the past , there has been legislation aimed at combating this .\nThe STOCK Act , passed after the 2008 financial crisis , attempted to stop insider trading by making it illegal for government officials to trade stocks after receiving material or nonpublic information \u201c derived \u201d from their jobs , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs .\nIn light of the Loeffler and Perdue activity , that bill has been re-examined and some people have argued it did not go far enough .\n\u201c Given that Congress \u2019 first obligation is to the American people and that serving that obligation so often requires having more knowledge than ordinary American investors , why should members of Congress be permitted to trade individual stocks at all ?\n\u201d Tyler Gellasch , a former Senate staffer who helped draft the STOCK Act , wrote last year in a piece for Politico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to even be capable when making business decisions of

@ power distribution professor .\nGermany now finds itself in the dead of winter .\nMuch of the country has seen considerable snowfall , meaning solar panels are often covered by snow and thus rendered useless .\nEven without snow cover , the weeks-long overcast sky prevents any noteworthy solar power generation .\nMoreover , this winter there have been many long windless periods , and so

report has been taken down from the archives , yet is fortunately available on YouTube thanks to wind energy protest group Vernunftkraft.de .\nIn the report Daniel Bartig , a mechanic at the LEAG Lausitz plant , tells RBB he is skeptical that green energy can do the job , and says \u201c the greatest share of power is currently coming from coal.\n\u201d Green energies will not keep pace with demand Next in the report , RBB interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Cottbus , who tells RBB he \u2019 s very skeptical of wind and solar energy doing the job .\nAs Germany moves to shut down its reliable nuclear and coal power plants , the gap between supply and demand will grow dangerously wide .\nWith this supply of wind and photovoltaic energy , it \u2019 s between 0 and 2 or 3 percent \u2013 that is de facto zero .\nYou can see it in many diagrams that we have days , weeks , in the year where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time for example \u2013 there is no wind and PV , and there are

Pfizer/BioNTech genetic product .\nFor the first time , there is an eyewitness report from a Berlin nursing home on the situation after the vaccination .\nIt comes from the AGAPLESION Bethanien Havelgarten retirement home in Berlin-Spandau .\nThere , within four weeks after the first vaccination with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 seniors , who suffered from dementia but were in good physical condition according to their age before the vaccination , died .\nThe first death occurred after only six days , and five other seniors died approximately 14 days after vaccination .\nThe first symptoms of the

no detailed information about the novelty of this mRNA vaccine which has only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been provided .\nAttorney at Law Viviane Fischer and Attorney at Law Dr. Reiner F\u00fcllmich of the Corona Committee spoke in a video interview with the whistleblower about the closer circumstances of the vaccination , the symptoms that occurred and the different nature of the deaths in temporal connection with the vaccination .\nOn January 3 , 2021 , 31 female and male residents of the dementia ward \u201c ground floor/protected area \u201d had been vaccinated with Comirnaty .\nRelatives of another three seniors had objected to vaccination , and two residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccination was given .\nThe residents of this ward are very active , \u201c self defending \u201d dementia patients who are physically in good condition .\nThey are allowed to move around the ward all day without restriction .\nThe day before the vaccination , the 31 vaccinated persons were all in good health .\nA few days earlier , all had tested negative for Corona , according to the whistleblower report .\nAccording to the whistleblower , the first vaccination event with Comirnaty on January 3 , 2021 , took place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered in the recreation room of the first floor area .\nA vaccination team consisting of an aged vaccinator , three aides and two federal soldiers in camouflage uniforms performed the vaccinations .\nThe home staff as well as the home physician assisted in the process .\nThe role of the soldiers , who at no time moved away from the vaccine , has not been conclusively

in the case of unfamiliar treatments , was hardly recognizable , so predominantly \u201c lamblike \u201d they had let the vaccination with Comirnaty pass over them .\nThe whistleblower suspects that this could also be related to the fact that the elderly seniors , who had still experienced the war , could not properly assess the role of the soldiers and possibly felt reminded of war-traumatic circumstances .\nDuring the first vaccination , a resisting senior citizen was detained by a nurse under the watchful eyes of the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial decision for the detention , which as such represents a coercion and therefore requires in principle a judicial evaluation in the individual case , had not been issued .\nAccording to the whistleblower \u2019 s account , the

is also regularly done with the use of physical force against the seniors resisting the unwanted treatment , the whistleblower said .\nAccording to the whistleblower , the vaccination education of the caregivers and relatives \u2013 the seniors are unable to effectively consent to vaccination due to their dementia \u2013 was based on outdated information sheets from the RKI/Gr\u00fcnes Kreuze .\nIn

information should have been provided that from the point of view of the regulatory authority EMA , the data situation still needs to be improved with regard to various aspects , e.g .\nthe interaction of Comirnaty with other drugs .\nAlready on the day of vaccination , four of the vaccinated seniors began to show unusual symptoms .\nIn the evening of that day they were fatigued and extremely tired , some of them fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sharp drop in blood oxygen saturation was noted .\nIn the further course , the leaden fatigue continued , the oxygen saturation in the blood remained insufficient , in some cases gasping breathing occurred , and fever , edema , skin rash , a yellowish-gray discoloration of the skin , and a ( characteristic ) muscle tremor of the upper body and arms occurred .\nThe seniors also showed a change in demeanor , were partially unresponsive , and refused to eat or drink .\nOne vaccinated senior , who had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her age and suffered from no serious previous illnesses , died as early as January 9 , 2021 , just six days after vaccination .\nDeaths among vaccinated seniors and senior citizens occurred on January 15 ,

their authoritative source exculpating the vaccine .\nI was curious to know what cutting-edge test the medical examiner might have performed that would so definitively rule out the vaccine as a contributing culprit .\nUnder the best circumstances , vaccine injuries are notoriously difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to diagnose \u2014 so difficult , in fact , that doctors miss MORE than 99 % of them , according to a 2010 U.S. Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) study .\nVaccine injuries wear so many guises that nobody even knows what they look like .\nManufacturers \u2019 U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) -required product inserts on the 16 vaccines the Centers for Disease and Prevention ( CDC ) recommends for children list some 400 ways that vaccines can kill or injure people .\nThese include heart attacks , myocardial infarction , strokes , seizures , tachycardia , a long list of allergies and allergic reactions , encephalopathy , anaphylaxis , arteritis , autoimmune injuries , blood clots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden death and many , many others .\nVaccine injuries and deaths generally result from aggravations of existing comorbidities .\nBut since the vaccine rarely leaves a distinctive fingerprint , there is almost no way to determine if the vaccine triggered the fatal event \u2014 even with an extensive autopsy .\nThe National Academy of Sciences has listed 175 injuries closely associated with vaccines , and concludes that there is insufficient science to exonerate or definitively inculpate any of them .\nIn cases before the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program ( Vaccine Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflexive position that something else caused the injuries .\nThe Vaccine Court has nevertheless paid out $ 4.5 billion for vaccine injuries .\nThe deciding factor in most of these cases is timing ; If the injury or death associated with that vaccine occurred within a few days or weeks following inoculation , the court is more likely to assume culpability .\nContrary to the positions of the so-called \u201c Fact Checkers \u201d and others , no one can say that the Moderna vaccine killed Aaron , and no one can rule it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to accurately assess a vaccine \u2019 s risks is through placebo studies \u2014 or retrospective studies \u2014 that compare health outcomes in vaccinated versus unvaccinated cohorts .\nThese studies must be of sufficient duration to capture injuries with longer incubation periods or diagnostic horizons .\nWhile such studies , properly designed , can tell us if a particular vaccine can cause , for example , heart attacks or strokes , it is virtually impossible to tell if a vaccine caused a particular heart attack or stroke in a specific patient .\nModerna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assess the vaccine \u2019 s risks to the elderly Hank Aaron was 86 years old .\nThe Moderna vaccine trials included no individuals over 80 years old and only 20 individuals over 70 .\nA study of this anemic statistical power could detect no special vulnerabilities in people over 80 and could detect risks only from lethal injuries like heart attacks if they killed more than 1 in 20 vaccine recipients over 70 .\nThis is unfortunate , since this was the very cohort that the CDC targeted for the first round of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 70 .\nTherefore , a vaccine that kills one in every 21 seniors could conceivably cost the lives of 1,619,047 Americans \u2014 far more than have died from coronavirus .\nFurthermore , Moderna tested its vaccine on a carefully selected group that included only the healthiest representatives of each age group .\nModerna purposefully excluded individuals with comorbidities or vulnerabilities .\nThe Moderna study group , as a whole , had 1/6th the daily death rate of average Americans .\nIn other words , Moderna \u2019 s trial tells us virtually nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average Americans in any age group .\nNevertheless , the study results were bristling with red flags .\nDespite the extreme vitality of its elite participants , Moderna \u2019 s Phase I clinical trial reported astonishingly high injury rates .\nA stunning 100 % of vaccine recipients suffered adverse events .\nMoreover , 6 % of the low-dose group ( 1 in 20 ) and 21 % of the high-dose group ( 1 in 5 ) reported \u201c serious injuries \u201d so grave that they required medical intervention or hospitalization .\nThe Moderna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phase 2 as Pfizer \u2019 s vaccine .\nRegulators are relying on the VAERS surveillance system to assess the risk of Moderna \u2019 s vaccine The elite participants , small sizes and abbreviated approval periods in Moderna \u2019 s COVID vaccine have highlighted the grave deficiencies of our government \u2019 s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) as a national crisis .\nHere \u2019 s why : Based on its devastating reactogenicity , the Moderna vaccine could never qualify for FDA approval .\nNevertheless , in consideration of the pandemic crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fauci \u2019 s peculiar commitment to this vaccine ) , the FDA nonetheless gave Moderna Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) .\nEUA is , by definition , a mass population-wide science experiment with an unapproved and unusually dangerous drug on millions of people .\nFauci justifies this high-risk gambit by arguing that , as they administer the Moderna vaccine to millions of people , regulators will quickly see if it is causing unacceptable levels of injuries or deaths .\nIn that case , officials will make rapid course corrections , seamlessly shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson & Johnson .\nHere \u2019 s the big problem : This bold scheme can ONLY work if the existing surveillance system is capable of detecting virtually all potential vaccine injuries over the first two months \u2014 the time when most vaccine-related deaths are likely to occur .\nSince there is no placebo group , regulators \u2014 using national health data \u2014 could then compare death rates among recently vaccinated 80-year-olds to background death rates from unvaccinated 80-year-olds over a similar two-month period .\nIf fatalities occurring in the vaccinated group are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same period , then we can assume that the vaccine is dangerous .\nAt best , this methodology for determining vaccine risks has many ethical and statistical deficiencies .\nAnd its capacity to predict risk is ABSOLUTELY DEPENDENT on EVERY DEATH following vaccination being meticulously counted as potentially vaccine-related \u2014 no matter what the patient \u2019 s doctor or coroner believes .\nBut what if the injuries are invisible ?\nWhat if the surveillance system doesn \u2019 t spot them ?\nWhat if doctors don \u2019 t recognize or report vaccine injuries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report them are censored , ridiculed , gaslighted , shamed and de-platformed on social media ?\nWhat if the national media denounces individuals who raise common sense questions ?\nTo paraphrase Emerson \u2019 s query about falling trees , \u201c If no one records the vaccine injury in the VAERS system \u2014 and no one reads about it in the media \u2014 can Fauci and Moderna declare that the injury didn \u2019 t occur and that their vaccine is therefore safe , no matter how many people it actually kills ?\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media has joined a dangerous project to suppress the reporting of potential vaccine injuries that , itself , gravely jeopardizes public health .\nThis conundrum highlights the larger problem that Children \u2019 s Health Defense ( CHD ) has struggled to bring to the attention of health officials .\nOn Dec.18 , 2020 , CHD sent a letter to COVID-19 Advisory Board member Dr. David Kessler urging him to replace the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) and to implement a functioning surveillance system prior to authorizing population-wide administration of COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally dysfunctional .\nIn 1993 , then-Surgeon General David Kessler , now President Biden \u2019 s COVID czar , joined a gathering clamor by public health advocates demanding reform of the VAERS system .\nKessler complained that vaccine injury reports received by FDA \u201c represent only a fraction of the serious adverse events.\n\u201d In 2010 , 17 years later , CDC had done nothing to remedy the deficiency .\nThat year a comprehensive report funded by HHS concluded that VAERS collects \u201c fewer than 1 % of vaccine injuries.\n\u201d Even vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 memo \u201c a fifty-fold underreporting of [ vaccine ] adverse events.\n\u201d Sadly , VAERS is therefore wholly inadequate for capturing vaccine injuries and worthless for assessing vaccine risks .\nVAERS has all the inefficiencies of any voluntary reporting system and many others that are unique .\nHealthcare workers are unlikely to recognize , and even less likely to report , most vaccine injuries .\nAccording to Los Angeles physician Dr. Rachel West , \u201c Physicians receive no training as to how to recognize vaccine injury in medical school .\nTo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries don \u2019 t exist .\nMost physicians don \u2019 t know how to identify them.\n\u201d There are overwhelming financial and professional disincentives to reporting .\n\u201c No one pays us for the time spent filing VAERS reports , \u201d said West , \u201c and most doctors don \u2019 t want to acknowledge to their patients that an intervention they recommended caused a death or severe injury .\nIt \u2019 s always easier to dismiss injuries as \u2018 unrelated to the vaccine.\n\u2019 \u201d Most importantly , the medical establishment actively discourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are punished in hundreds of subtle and direct ways if we acknowledge that a vaccine caused harm , \u201d said West .\nThe medical cartel treats doctors who frequently report or treat vaccine injuries as dangerous and irresponsible pariahs , and systematically punishes them .\nMedical boards , acting as commissars for the orthodoxy that all vaccines are safe for all people , shut down clinics and remove the licenses of physicians who take an interest in studying , reporting , and treating vaccine injuries .\nIn December 2020 , a team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children comparing health outcomes in vaccinated versus unvaccinated children using medical records from Dr. Paul Thomas \u2019 extensive pediatric practice in Oregon .\nThe study documented high levels of a dozen types of injuries related to vaccination .\nIn retaliation , the Oregon Medical Board suspended Thomas \u2019 s license five days after the study \u2019 s publication .\nAttorney Richard Jaffe , who specializes in representing doctors who treat vaccine injuries , said that the California Medical Board has either filed delicensing proceedings or is actively investigating virtually every doctor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever written a vaccine exemption .\nJaffe represents a long roster of beloved physicians whose livelihoods are in jeopardy because they treat vaccine injury as a reality .\nIn all 50 states , doctors have little recourse against all-powerful medical boards that strip away the licenses of physicians who question vaccine safety .\nMedia acts in concert with medical establishment to suppress acknowledgment of vaccine injury The Tiffany Dover incident offers a template for how media and medical authorities act in concert to gaslight the public to suppress reports of vaccine injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , collapsed on national TV after receiving a vaccine at a press event .\nHer injuries reportedly required subsequent hospitalization .\nMedical officials who sponsored the event and their media partners immediately circled their wagons .\nHer hospital hastily released a statement that Dover had suffered long-existing pain reflex unrelated to the vaccine .\nThe credulous national press assured the public that her loss of consciousness was not vaccine-related .\nDover \u2019 s accounts disappeared from social media .\nSocial media campaigns censored and de-platformed individuals who reposted the video of her collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a role in Dover \u2019 s faint .\nTo this day , no one knows what really happened to Dover .\nThe media \u2019 s lack of curiosity should alarm anyone interested in vaccine safety , as press scrutiny is often the lone force that safeguards the public from vaccine companies that are immune from legal liability or market forces , in the case of mandated vaccines .\nOn Sunday , citing my \u201c fake \u201d Hank Aaron claim , the St. Paul Pioneer Press published an article urging the national press to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories about COVID vaccine injuries .\nSuch advice is largely gratuitous .\nDenying vaccine injury is a survival skill for journalists .\nWhen it comes to public health , the media no longer does journalism .\nReporters instead play the role of ideological inquisitors \u2014 guardians of the sacred orthodoxy that \u201c all vaccines are safe and effective.\n\u201d And as with all orthodoxies , its zealots act in concert to silence , discredit and ban the heretics who question dominant dogmas .\nAmong American journalists , blind faith in undeserving authorities has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific literacy and peer review as the source of scientific knowledge .\n\u201c Fact-checking \u201d under the current rubric means checking the disputed statement against the pronouncements of government agencies like the World Health Organization or CDC .\nFact checkers who are supposed to expose \u201c vaccine misinformation \u201d are instead its purveyors .\nAny discussions of the well-documented financial entanglements and corrupting conflicts between the pharmaceutical companies and their captured regulators are similarly taboo in the mainstream media .\nHank Aaron \u2019 s death was unrelated to vaccines , the media told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis script is now so familiar that The New York Times can safely invent this coroner \u2019 s verdict , knowing that no reporters will fact-check a story that supports vaccination .\nSo why bother actually calling the coroner ?\nThe actual definition of this exercise is not \u201c journalism , \u201d it is \u201c propaganda.\n\u201d These public kabuki plays \u2014 starring Hank Aaron and Tiffany Dover \u2014 teach us all how to think and to behave .\nThe barrage of national media vituperation that met my common-sense question about Aaron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted to voice similar heresies .\nMy decades of experience on the front line , my thick skin and inclination for combat , my infrastructure \u2014 the deep bench of scientists and physicians who support CHD \u2019 s mission \u2014 all give me the resilience to withstand such attacks and to push back .\nVery few people are similarly equipped .\nBut consider the effect that my high-profile public shaming will have on others tempted to proffer similar questions about the sudden deaths of Cicely Tyson , Larry King and Andrew Brooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented the COVID-19 saliva test before dying on Jan. 23 of an unexpected heart attack .\nIf any of these individuals received COVID vaccines , I can practically guarantee that none of their family doctors reported those deaths to VAERS as potential vaccine events .\nIt \u2019 s hard to imagine that any reporter or investigative journalist in the country would be rash enough to incinerate their careers by investigating these potential associations .\nThe media has thus made itself complicit in Pharma \u2019 s campaign to mask vaccine injuries .\nThis \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame , marginalize , demonize and silence questioning is a formula for making vaccine injuries vanish by fiat and intimidation .\nIt is a recipe for a national health calamity .\nEvidence suggests dysfunction of VAERS system is deliberate strategy by U.S. health authorities In 2010 , following decades of complaints about systematic undercounting of vaccine injuries , CDC finally acted to correct the VAERS system \u2019 s notorious dysfunction .\nCDC contracted its sister HHS agency , the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) , to design an \u00fcber-efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture most vaccine injuries .\nAHRQ \u2019 s new Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) system would use HMO data to overlay injury claims atop vaccination records for every patient and then perform a cluster analysis to identify vaccine injuries .\nAHRQ \u2019 s pilot system performed brilliantly .\nUnfortunately , its very efficiency spelled the project \u2019 s doom .\nWhen AHRQ tested its artificial intelligence counting system on the Harvard Pilgrim HMO \u2019 s database , the new system detected vaccine injuries in 2.6 % of vaccine recipients .\nThis meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an embarrassing departure from the 1/1,000,000 publicly claimed by CDC .\nWhen CDC saw these alarming results , it cancelled AHRQ \u2019 s contract , derailed the system \u2019 s planned rollout to the other HMOs , and subsequently stopped answering phone calls from the AHRQ contractor .\nThe AHRQ consultants explained that their promising project was suddenly dead in the water \u201c because the necessary CDC contacts were no longer available and the CDC consultants responsible for receiving data were no longer responsive to our multiple requests to proceed with testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broken vaccine system apparently precisely because it masked vaccine injuries and allowed CDC to continue to publicly underestimate risks .\nThis incident suggests that CDC , putting Pharma profits ahead of public health , has purposefully designed VAERS to fail .\nVAERS allows dangerous vaccines to remain on the market Vaccine proponents often argue that vaccine deaths are collateral damage in the battle against the pandemic , and that no matter how many people die from a vaccination , the vaccine will still yield a net saving of lives .\nBut is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a particularly reactogenic vaccine ( like Moderna \u2019 s ) could even kill more people than the disease against which it purportedly promises immunity ?\nAnd is it possible that health authorities would continue administering that vaccine year after year and never notice all the carnage ?\nAs it turns out , this is quite possible .\nThe most sickening example is the DTP .\nThe DTP vaccine is the world \u2019 s most popular inoculation .\nApproximately 116 million African children have been receiving DTP shots annually for three decades .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others have long claimed that DTP saves \u201c millions of lives.\n\u201d Then in 2017 , the Danish government and a Danish vaccine maker , the Statens Serum Institut ( SSI ) , funded a study of the DTP to confirm its beneficial impacts on mortalities .\nAfter researching 30 years of data , the scientists concluded that the DTP vaccine was probably killing more children than died from diphtheria , pertussis and tetanus prior to the vaccine \u2019 s introduction .\nVaccinated girls were dying at 10 times the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inoculation .\nWhile protecting the children from diphtheria , pertussis and tetanus , the vaccine had ruined their immune systems , rendering them susceptible to other illnesses .\nThe vaccinated children were dying of pneumonia , bilharzia , leukemia , anemia , malaria and dysentery \u2014 all diseases that no one recognized as vaccine injuries .\nFor 30 years , no one realized that virtually all the deaths were occurring in the vaccinated children .\nThe DTP vaccine scandal offers a cautionary tale for anyone who believes that vaccine injuries are easily recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risks of Moderna \u2019 s vaccines without a functioning surveillance system .\nModerna vaccine could be causing more deaths than it is averting , without attracting notice To date ( as of Jan. 29 ) , VAERS has tabulated 11,249 reports from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines of one or more \u201c health impact events , \u201d which HHS defines as \u201c unable to perform normal daily activities , unable to work , required care from doctor or health care professional , \u201d and 501 deaths .\nSince according to HHS \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer than 1 % of injuries , \u201d it is fair to assume an actual rate of 1,124,900 injuries and 50,100 deaths .\n( These figures may undercount the casualties since I \u2019 m giving the vaccine makers the benefit of the doubt by assuming that a full 1 % of injuries are reported , rather than \u201c fewer than 1 % \u201d estimated by the AHRQ study . )\nApproximately 9.9 % of the population has been vaccinated so far .\nIf we then extrapolate the resultant injury ratios to the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could mean 13,391,666 injuries and 595,000 deaths if all Americans receive vaccines as currently projected .\n\u2022 And even this grisly projection could underestimate Moderna \u2019 s mortalities since Moderna \u2019 s reported death rate during clinical trials ( 0.36 deaths/100K/day ) is 5.41 times greater than Pfizer \u2019 s ( 0.07 deaths/100K/day ) .\n\u2022 Furthermore , current death and injury rates mainly reflect administration of only a single dose .\nThe clinical trials indicated that the vast majority of injuries occurred after the second dose .\nFinally , because the Moderna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , we know almost nothing about the long-term risks of those vaccines , including the very real risks for an enhanced and dangerous immune reaction known as antibody-dependent enhancement , or pathogenic priming \u2014 violent and deadly reactions that occur when vaccinated subjects encounter wild coronaviruses .\nThis dangerous reaction has affected all past coronavirus vaccines in decades of research .\nAn April 2020 study in the Journal of Translational Autoimmunity suggests that \u201c Pathogenic priming likely contributes to serious and critical illness and mortality in COVID-19 via autoimmunity.\n\u201d The authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-vaccination.\n\u201d A January 2021 peer-reviewed article in Microbiology and Infectious Diseases by former National Institutes of Health contract scientist , Dr. J. Bart Classen , M.D.\n, suggests that mRNA vaccines may cause a prion disease similar to Mad Cow Disease , that can trigger : \u201c ALS , front temporal lobar degeneration , Alzheimer \u2019 s disease and other neurological degenerative diseases .\nThe enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than benefit.\n\u201d There is also a serious risk from autoimmune disease that might remain hidden for years .\nDuring the 2009 swine flu pandemic , GlaxoSmithKline won Emergency Use Authorization for its shoddily tested Pandemrix vaccine .\nBefore the regulators withdrew Pandemrix a few months later , it caused a wave of debilitating and permanent neurological injuries , including narcolepsy and catalepsy , across Europe .\nWe are already seeing injuries reported from the mRNA vaccines , including : To make an accurate risk/benefit calculation for any vaccine , regulators and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s efficacy .\nThe agencies sold us on their vaccine enterprise based upon two endpoints .\nThey promised that the vaccine would ( 1 ) provide herd immunity that would end the pandemic , and ( 2 ) prevent deaths .\nBut in their clinical trials , neither the Moderna nor the Pfizer vaccines demonstrated that either vaccine prevents COVID-19 related deaths , or disease transmission .\nThe trial endpoints indicated that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines prevent mild and moderate symptoms in 95 % of COVID cases and no demonstrated efficacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watered-down endpoint , Moderna \u2019 s and Pfizer \u2019 s claims to 95 % efficacy appear exaggerated .\nThe British Medical Journal suggested that Pfizer \u2019 s raw data is more indicative of 19-29 % efficacy against mild to moderate symptoms .\nThe Johnson & Johnson trials , in contrast , did show a strong beneficial impact against deaths .\nEqually alarming , the Pfizer and Moderna trials indicated that their vaccines don \u2019 t prevent transmission , which is the only basis for herd immunity .\nWorst , recent studies suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms but does not prevent infection or transmission is likely to drive the evolution and spread of more virulent and deadly strains of the disease .\nWe are already witnessing the evolution of such superbugs in South Africa and England .\nSo take a minute to absorb this information .\nAccording to the World Health Organization , these two mRNA vaccines are not shown to prevent transmission \u2014 so they can not give us herd immunity and can not end the pandemic .\nAnd they could not show that they prevented deaths .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking them ?\nThe best explanation is some combination of magical thinking or mass psychosis .\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines , it seems , will do little other than enrich Pharma and empower the regulatory technocrats .\nThese medical authorities and their media partners are currently preparing the public for this disappointing news by informing us that we should expect to continue to wear masks and to quarantine , because the vaccines will not stop the spread of COVID : \u201c the COVID will always be with us !\n\u201d Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at elevated risk and should therefore not be vaccinated .\nThese include up to some 100 million Americans who appear to have natural immunity from exposure to COVID-19 or a closely related strain , and even more who are part of peer groups that have an infinitesimal risk from COVID-19 and yet a measurable but unquantified risk from vaccination .\nSince these vaccines are not proven to prevent transmission , there is no rational basis for vaccinating these cohorts , which represent perhaps 80 % of the American population .\nThese individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor these cohorts , the vaccines are all risk and zero benefit .\nElderly Americans dying from COVID vaccines , but media and medical authorities systematically suppressing reports The Washington Post specifically fact-checked and \u201c debunked \u201d the second part of my comment \u2014 that Aaron \u2019 s death was \u201c part of a wave of deaths following COVID vaccines.\n\u201d The Post faithfully repeated the assurances of public officials that elderly were not dying disproportionately .\nA journal that once prided itself on exposing the lies of federal officials during Watergate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now cites the unsupported statements of technocrats as the only evidence needed .\nCDC \u2019 s own data demonstrate that the WaPo \u2019 s statement is \u201c vaccine misinformation.\n\u201d CDC \u2019 s VAERS shows that 53.8 % of reported vaccine deaths are in people over 75 , and that the average age of death is 77 .\nVAERS reports people over 65 account for 70 % of death reports post-COVID-19 vaccine .\nFor comparison , CDC data indicates that for \u201c Influenza disease , \u201d people over 65 account for only 48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reports are pouring in of elderly people dying shortly after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine .\nIn many cases , they die suddenly within hours of getting the shot .\nIn others , death occurs within the span of a couple of weeks .\nMost of the reported reactions are in the under-65 age range , yet most of the deaths are over 70 years .\nThe VAERS database contains many reports of healthy elderly getting vaccinated and then dying suddenly .\nThe Guardian reported on Jan. 16 that weekly nursing home deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to 1,200 deaths , since introduction of vaccines .\nIn Norway , 29 of 40 elderly patients in a nursing home receiving the vaccine died .\nMost were over the age of 75 .\nThe findings have prompted Norway to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines may be too risky for the very old and terminally ill .\nThe suppressing of these reports is now systematic .\nDoctors and nurses around the country are reporting to CHD that their hospitals are discouraging them \u2014 even disciplining them \u2014 for reporting injuries .\nMedical institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths following vaccination to COVID-19 instead of reporting them to VAERS .\n( This solution is both elegant and potentially lucrative as it allows medical institutions to cash in on rich incentives for treating COVID-19 . )\n\u2022 Prior to the vaccine , Gibraltar recorded a total of 10 deaths due to COVID-19 .\nFollowing Gibraltar \u2019 s launching of a COVID vaccine program on Jan. 10 , 75 seniors quickly died .\nVaccine critics termed the incident \u201c senior genocide.\n\u201d Gibraltar \u2019 s Chief Minister Fabian Picardo said , \u201c This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gibraltarians in over 100 years .\nEven in war , we have never lost so many in such a short time.\n\u201d Without irony , British health officials blamed the deaths on COVID-19 .\n\u2022 On Dec. 22 , 2020 , an Auburn , New York nursing home started vaccinating 193 residents .\nNo one in the nursing home had died from COVID-19 prior to the jab campaign .\nAs of Jan. 9 , 2021 , 24 seniors had died .\nHealth officials reflexively blamed the post-vaccination deaths on COVID-19 .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported 22 deaths among the 72 recently vaccinated residents of Pemberley House Care Home in Basingstoke .\nPredictably British health officials blamed the deaths on coronavirus , saying a disease outbreak had begun soon after the vaccine program .\n\u2022 On Jan. 28 , a German paper reported that 13 of 40 residents of the Uhldingen Muhlhofen senior citizens residential park died soon after vaccination .\nOfficials also blamed Covid-19 .\n\u2022 At Toronto \u2019 s Roberta Place Long Term Care Home , six people died after launch of its COVID vaccine program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2022 On Feb. 7 , the government of Spain \u2019 s Andalusia province suspended the vaccination of the elderly at the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario nursing home in Los Barrios , Cadiz , after 46 of them died after receiving the first dose of COVID vaccines .\nIn a nearby nursing home in Sancti Petri , in Chiclana , 22 elderly people died of COVID-19 immediately following vaccination .\n\u2022 In Belgium , the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products ( FAMHP ) reported that 14 people died after being vaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been found .\nIn addition to the demonstrated fatalities among elderly described in grim detail in VAERS , two websites document a multiplicity of news stories , studies , testimonies , etc .\nattesting to serious adverse events and deaths reasonably attributable to the relatively recent administration of the double-dose Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccines .\nThese reports document adverse events to all people but disproportionately to seniors .\n( The websites are here and here ) .\nFauci , who knows the critical importance of counting EVERY death following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping to drive the suppression of reported deaths among the elderly .\nFauci commented that the waves of fatalities in nursing homes following vaccination have to be \u201c put into context with the population they occurred in.\n\u201d In other words , these were old people \u2014 and old people die .\nFauci offered no data to support his claim .\nThere has been no formal analysis of the data to determine if , after the distribution of vaccines to nursing homes , the death rate in residents who were vaccinated was higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were not vaccinated .\nWhen seniors die before vaccination , officials and their media partners blame COVID-19 and use the mortalities to ratchet up fear levels and mobilize every institution to fight the dread disease .\nBut when seniors die following vaccination , media and the medical establishment declare their sudden departures to be from \u201c natural causes \u201d with no action necessary .\nMultiple studies lend biological plausibility to the hypothesis of the mRNA vaccine \u2019 s extreme reactogenicity and devastating lethality to seniors .\nIn a Dec. 8 , 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick Whelan , the immediate past president of the Los Angeles Pediatric Society , warned FDA that current research indicates that viral proteins generated by the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines are likely to cause tissue damage similar to that caused by COVID-19 .\nWhelan is no lightweight .\nHe holds triple teaching appointments at the medical schools at Harvard , UCLA and UC .\nHe weekly commutes between his practices at Mass General and UCLA Hospital System .\nWhelan reviewed animal studies that strongly suggest that it is not the live virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ injuries associated with COVID-19 infections , but breakdown products \u2014 most particularly the debris from spiked protein \u2014 that are the agents of COVID-19 \u2019 s signature devastation to distant organs , including the brain , heart , lungs and kidneys .\nWhelan warned that mRNA vaccines actually reproduce these same proteins and may also cause similar damage .\nHe describes particularly acute inflammation in human vascular systems that might result in clusters of blood clots , vascular inflammation , vascular collapse and other vascular disruptions that could cause deaths in older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility that proteins from the Moderna vaccine could inflame blood vessels over several weeks , causing potentially lethal circulatory problems in men Aaron \u2019 s age .\n\u201c Before any of these vaccines are approved for widespread use in humans , \u201d Whelan cautioned in his letter , \u201c it is important to assess in vaccinated subjects the effects of vaccination on the heart ( perhaps using cardiac MRI , as Puntmann et al .\ndid ) .\n\u201d Whelan concluded his letter this way : \u201c As important as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus by immunizing the population , it would be vastly worse if hundreds of millions of people were to suffer long-lasting or even permanent damage to their brain or heart microvasculature as a result of failing to appreciate in the short-term an unintended effect of full-length spike protein-based vaccines on these other organs.\n\u201d Front-line doctors and regulatory officials are seeing other evidence that seniors might face unassessed risks from the mRNA vaccine .\nA high-level neurologist M.D .\nworking in San Diego \u2019 s elite COVID-19 research unit ( he requested anonymity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look at the injury reports for all age groups , over half of the young people reporting adverse events experienced tachycardia .\nTheir heart rates were ramping up to 200 beats per minute .\nYoung people can tolerate that rate , whereas tachycardia following vaccination could actually kill an older patient .\nSudden death is often a cardiac event , I think we need to consider the possibility that a robust initial immune reaction initiated by the Moderna vaccine could result in tachycardia and potential deaths in the elderly .\nWe need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly post-vaccination .\nInstead , we are being told not to talk about this rash of deaths in the elderly.\n\u201d \u201c We have no idea whether it \u2019 s safe for seniors , \u201d warns the renowned pathologist Dr .\nSin Hang Lee , M.D.\n, F.R.C.P .\n( C ) , FCAP , director of Connecticut \u2019 s Milford Molecular Diagnostics .\nReferring to the Jan. 29 CDC data dump , Lee told me : \u201c One-fifth of all deaths were cardiac/myocardia as a symptom \u2014 average age 74 .\nOverall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tachycardia reported in VAERS.\n\u201d Lee believes these deaths are from myocardial damage related to vaccine reactions : \u201c Sudden unexpected deaths are usually cardiac origin , unless there is evidence of massive cerebral hemorrhage into much of the intracerebral compartment , which is easy to spot .\nI think there should be a national investigation into the manner of nursing home deaths , 1 ) due to COVID-19 , and 2 ) after injections of mRNA vaccines.\n\u201d *** Author

as part of carrying out satellite communication and navigation warfare .\nThe concept of having a dedicated branch of the US Armed Forces monitoring the space domain for threats and developing capabilities to defend against those threats makes perfect sense , particularly at a time when space is becoming increasingly accessible and space-based capabilities for civil , economic and military applications become increasingly central to modern daily life .\nRussia and China have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces to do precisely this as well , with Russia having established the Russian Space Forces and China having created the People \u2019 s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force .\nThe real problem with the US Space Force is not the concept behind its face-value creation or its stated mission , but with the inevitable abuse of this new branch of military service by the special interests that drive US foreign policy .\nProtecting America or Preventing Others from Protecting Themselves From America ?\nWhen the US Space Force talks about protecting its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not talking about a Russian or Chinese attack on GPS capabilities over the United States to disrupt applications essential for daily life in America .\nIt is actually talking about the disruption of GPS capabilities overseas in theaters of war the US is illegally involved in .\nThe National Interest in a 2019 article titled , \u201c GPS Jammed : Russia Is Messing with America \u2019 s F-35s , \u201d would claim : Syria is a nation the US has illegally occupied for years .\nThis is in addition to its military

protecting the United States , its people or its economy , but actually playing a role in preventing other nations around the globe from protecting themselves and their allies from US military

military presence in places like the South China Sea and in or around the Taiwan Strait , and likewise the USSF will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that uninvited military presence .\nNew Branch , New Domain to Target China The US aerospace industry \u2019 s ties to the newly established US Space Force is essential .\nAmong the leading companies in that industry is Elon Musk \u2019 s SpaceX .\nIt was interesting to see Musk interact with US Air Force Lieutenant General John Thompson during the 2020 Air Warfare Symposium , and in particular , the latter \u2019 s reoccuring concern over America \u2019 s ability to maintain a competitive edge over China .\nThe thing that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy is going to be probably at least twice as big as the U.S. economy .\nMaybe three times , but at least twice .\nYeah , so , that assumes a GDP per capita still less than the U.S .\nBut since they have about four or five times the population , then it would only require getting to a GDP per capita of half the United

better be real innovative .\nIf you \u2019 re not innovative , you \u2019 re gon na lose .\nFor Musk , it seems , it is not a matter of whether or not China would overtake the US , but a matter of how the US would remain competitive once it did .\nChina is a geographically enormous nation and possesses the largest population on Earth .\nIf allowed to develop , it will inevitably surpass @ @ @ @ @ @

tank policy papers they echo in their talks , the US seeks primacy , and not merely remaining competitive versus a larger and more powerful China .\nThe US seeks to prevent China from ever becoming larger and more powerful in the first place .\nTo do so will obviously involve the use of force , whether in the form of economic sanctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual warfare .\nAnd it will be in this vein that the US Space Force will seek to use its capabilities to achieve this as part of a continued campaign of political , economic and military pressure aimed at China , its allies and at its ongoing development and in turn , at its ability to surpass the US economically and militarily .\nThe US Space Force will be tasked not with defending space-based infrastructure , but ensuring others , particularly Russia and China , can not be defended from it and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , the orbital warfare capabilities the US Space Force is developing will not likely be used for defense or even retaliation as many would probably like to assume , but for the same sort of military aggression other US military branches carry out terrestrially .\nThus , the concept behind the US Space Force is sound , but the current path of US foreign policy ensures that its actual mission will drift far from both this concept and its stated mission , potentially impeding its development into a

career climatists make it out to be .\nAndrew Montford Spectator Mag As I watch the snow blow past my window , it \u2019 s hard not to scoff at the idea of a \u2018 climate emergency \u2019 .\nHowever , I \u2019 m probably in a minority .\nThe idea that we are currently experiencing a dangerous deterioration in our weather has been pushed so hard , and for so long , that the man in the Clapham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us who have the time and inclination to look at the evidence for such claims , on the other hand , realize that they are largely overblown .\nThe Global Warming Policy Foundation , where I work , has just published a review of the impacts of climate change and it \u2019 s a valuable antidote to the relentless alarmism pushed by some academics .\nThe paper is written by Indur Goklany , an American whose involvement in the climate field goes back 30 years when he was involved in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( IPCC ) review of the world \u2019 s climate .\nSo he knows what he is talking about , and the story he tells is one of almost unmitigated good news .\nThere is a great deal of evidence that mankind is able to take the effects of climate change in its stride .\nSEE ALSO : Bjorn Lomborg : \u2018 Don \u2019 t Waste Trillions on BAD Climate Policy \u2019 Take extreme weather for example .\nFor 30 years , everyone from the Met Office to Al Gore has been telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make things much worse .\nBut as Goklany shows , it just hasn \u2019 t happened ; three decades of shirt-tearing , tears , and wailing on the subject have changed things barely at all .\nIn most areas , this should mostly be uncontroversial : the IPCC said in 2013 that it has \u2018 low confidence \u2019 that droughts and hurricanes have become worse globally , and the best it can say of extreme rainfall is that it thinks there have been more areas with increases than decreases .\nOn heatwaves it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 medium confidence \u2019 of a global increase .\nBut while we shouldn \u2019 t shy away from discussions over how to tackle these issues , it is not the impending catastrophe that some might make it out to be .\nGoklany \u2019 s report isn \u2019 t just about refuting the bald claim that extreme weather has become worse across the board .\nIt also deals with the broader suggestion that worsening weather will adversely affect human welfare .\nAs he shows , mortality from extreme weather events is almost a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 99 percent over the last century .\nSimilarly , mankind now seems much better equipped to deal with the impact of weather and climate .\nOnce you have adjusted for rising population and growing wealth , records of weather damage show , if anything , a long-term decline too .\nWhen you look at the broader impacts of climate change , it \u2019 s the same story .\nTake sea-level rise , for example .\nWhile it \u2019 s possible to argue about how fast it \u2019 s happening , and the relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measuring the rate , Goklany points to a recent study that showed that siltation and reclamation are giving us new land around our coasts faster than any sea-level rise is removing it .\nIn other words , we are taking sea-level rise in our stride \u2014 perhaps unsurprising since we have been building sea defenses for the last 7,000 years .\nSimilarly , a few years back , we were regularly assailed by stories of the disappearance of coral atolls , but the excitement seems to have died away , no doubt prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most atolls are actually stable or getting bigger .\nAmusingly , just as global warming was previously said to cause the atolls to disappear , it is now said to be the cause of their growth .\nWhatever the truth , it \u2019 s surely hard for any reasonable person to portray growing atolls as an emergency .\nAnd on it goes .\nRates of death from climate-related disease \u2014 another favorite of the doom-mongers \u2014 haven \u2019 t just got better , they have collapsed , with astonishing falls in almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an example , the death tolls from malaria and diarrhea have both fallen by around a half .\nOf course , this is not a function of climate change ; it \u2019 s all down to better medical care and the deployment of simple preventative measures such as insecticide-treated mosquito nets .\nThe conclusion is hard to avoid : climate-related disease can be addressed with a little money and even less fuss .\nLike sea-level rise , it \u2019 s simply not an emergency .\nGlobal warming doesn \u2019 t seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply continues to grow , with fossil-fuel-derived fertilizers and the beneficial effects of higher carbon dioxide levels delivering new record yields across the globe almost every year .\nThis is not to say that it hasn \u2019 t got warmer , but simply that any deleterious effects have been swamped by the benefits of carbon dioxide and by the technological advances that mankind has deployed .\nFertilizers \u2014 both man-made and natural \u2014 have also had the beneficial side effect of reducing pressure on the natural world .\nSince the 1960s , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the area devoted to farmland has increased by only 8 percent .\nIndeed , if it were not for environmentalists persuading governments that biofuels were a good idea , we might have seen countless thousands of hectares returned to nature already .\nOf course , Dr. Goklany \u2019 s pointing this out will make not the slightest difference to the scientists whose livelihoods depend on keeping politicians firm in a belief that the world is about to end .\nIt \u2019 s easy enough for them to come up with new measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 Rising crop yields ?\nPah , take a look at the fall in crop yield potential !\n\u2019 they say .\n\u2018 Millions no longer dying from malaria ?\nBut look at the\u2026 erm\u2026 a couple of thousand dying from dengue fever !\n\u2019 .\nOr they can predict that things will get worse \u2014 or more often , much worse \u2014 in the future .\nSoils will degrade they say , new diseases will arise , and of course , extreme weather will get worse too .\nThey say we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world \u2019 s economies and industrial practices to alleviate carbon emissions , just in case they are a threat to global climate stability .\nBut as we career headlong into our net-zero emissions future , there is every sign that the costs of what is proposed will not only reverse many of the gains we have made in the last half-century but make things far worse than if we simply adopted a policy of adapting to what the climate throws at us .\nAs Goklany shows , we are good at adaptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time .\nAnd with the government stubbornly refusing to release an array of financial figures supporting their decarbonization plans , there is a strong suggestion that they know the course they have started us down is unsupportable on any rational grounds .\nTheir plans to \u2018 build back better \u2019 are therefore likely to be a hammer blow to an economy that is already reeling from the pandemic .\nSo if in a few year \u2019 s time you find you are worrying about paying the heating bill , or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can \u2019 t afford the government-mandated insulation measures , you might like to cast your eye back over Dr. Goklany \u2019 s paper and wonder why we set out on the course we did .\n***

Virtual G7 remote conference where he promised to force Americans to pay for more \u2018 climate action.\n\u2019 His strategy centers around two main concepts : \u2018 decarbonization \u2019 and deindustrialization .\nWe \u2019 re told that both of these theoretical utopists ideas are urgently needed , supposedly to \u2018 save the planet , \u2019 according to activists and the Davos billionaire jet-set .\nBut is it true ?\nWhile the usual green polemics may play well to the Democrats \u2019 ultra-left progressive alliance , the specifics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are routinely omitted from the political rhetoric , maybe because they often do not square with either technological and economic reality .\nIf Americans really knew the consequences of these proposed radical climatist policies , then they would likely reject them as impractical , and even reckless .\nJust ask the residents of Texas after the state \u2019 s wind turbines froze during last week \u2019 s epic cold surge .\nBut what the Biden Administration is currently proposing may be far worse .\nIt seems that the only real guarantee being given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reap a massive windfall in profits from any Green New Deal government mandates .\nOn Friday , President Joe Biden pledged climate action at the virtual G7 and teased an upcoming major summit on Earth Day , April 22 , 2021 .\nDeep decarbonization is what Team Biden wants \u2013 the complete end of carbon fuel for electricity , cars , trucks and industrial production .\nMajor economies must \u201c chart a path to deep decarbonization , \u201d former Secretary of State John Kerry , who is special presidential envoy for climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s all about finding another way to power our planet .\nWhat \u2019 s that add up to ?\nAccording to Kerry , the U.S. must phase out coal five times faster , phase in renewables six times faster , and bring in electric vehicles 22 times faster .\nOh my .\nI love trees and rivers and clean air .\nBut realize , there are dirty secrets behind this all-out drive to decarbonization .\nHere are five .\n1 .\nWind and Solar Can \u2019 t Meet US Electricity Demand Now or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Energy projected that coal and natural gas will still contribute nearly 40 % of U.S. electricity generation in 2050 .\nWind and solar power will increase but they aren \u2019 t ready to meet the huge demand for electricity without fossil fuels and nuclear power in the mix .\n2 .\nChina \u2019 s Not Ready to Go Green and is Still Building Coal-Fired Electricity Plants China is the world \u2019 s biggest polluter .\nChina generates 28 % of the planet \u2019 s yearly carbon dioxide emissions and won \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions until 2030 .\nYes , Xi Jinping has a plan to get China to net-zero emissions in 2060 , 10 years after everyone else .\nHowever , China \u2019 s plan starts with increasing carbon emissions for 10 years , then radically scaling back .\nHuh ?\nFact is , China can \u2019 t slack off economic growth .\nEven down the road , China \u2019 s plan won \u2019 t stop all emissions , it just includes a lot of offsets from carbon capture and planting trees .\nIn my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuclear arms control agreement ( which China won \u2019 t join ) than to track China \u2019 s true status on greenhouse gas emissions .\n3 .\nBiden Ordered the Military to Tackle the Climate Crisis Speaking of national security , Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin declared \u201c climate considerations \u201d an essential element of national security on Jan. 27 .\nThe military has already dabbled in clean energy .\nYou \u2019 ll find solar panels on military bases , and the U.S Air Force got a green fuel award for flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2006 .\nWhat \u2019 s new is that Team Biden wants sweeping involvement by the military and perhaps more important , the defense budget involved in climate change technology experiments .\nAustin \u2019 s directive covers everything from climate risk in wargames to overall defense strategy .\nScary stuff , given the slate of national security threats from China , Russia , Iran and others .\n4 .\nClean Energy Is Big Business , If the Fossil Fuel Gang Can Be Pushed Aside Global investment in renewables will exceed $ 10 trillion through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hype around the Paris climate accords covers up the brawl between fossil fuels and renewables .\nTeam Biden is directing U.S. government money away from \u201c carbon \u201d coal , oil and gas to renewables .\nThe Jan. 27 White House climate directive orders federal funding not to directly subsidize fossil fuels .\nIt \u2019 s complicated , but renewable energy isn \u2019 t big enough or efficient enough to dominate the market itself yet , so it needs help .\nIt requires tax incentives such as wind power production tax credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax dollars are the only way to make \u201c clean \u201d energy cheaper right now .\nDespite all this , it \u2019 s no secret that Kerry wants Wall Street money committed to climate goals .\nKerry has for years rallied Wall Street investors like Citigroup and Goldman Sachs to green energy .\nThe recent climate policy actions by the White House plus the slew of incentives already in place aim to stimulate market demand for renewables .\nWhen you consider that Berkshire Hathaway owns 7 % of the wind turbines in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late to stop this juggernaut .\nAll that cash from globalization has to go somewhere .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR WINTER FUNDRAISING DRIVE HERE", "author": "NEWS WIRE",

pushed on the public over the last 12 months .\nBack in December of 2020 , when Michael Gove was asked directly about whether there were any plans to introduce a new \u201c vaccine passport \u201d in order to restrict unvaccinated peoples \u2019 access to places such as shops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for travel , the Cabinet Office minister flatly told the BBC , \u201c That \u2019 s not the plan.\n\u201d Not quite a straight answer , but but most people took it on faith at the time .\nHe was asked a subsequent time , and again denied it , saying \u201c no.\n\u201d In early February , after The Times reported that the government would be implementing COVID vaccine passports in time for summer , however vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi responded by categorically denying it .\nSpeaking to Sky News , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don \u2019 t know the impact of the vaccines on transmission.\n\u201d \u201c Two , it would be discriminatory and I think the right thing to do is to make sure that people come forward to be vaccinated because they want to rather than it be made in some way mandatory through a passport.\n\u201d Despite these and other public denials by politicians , today it was revealed that the government \u2019 s NHS COVID Track & Trace App will become the new digital COVID \u201c digital certificate \u201d allowing people to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the experimental vaccine , or have tested negative .\nAccording to the new report , Downing Street is considering allowing businesses to demand to see a person \u2019 s Vaccine Passport before allowing entry to a

fast-tracking this new vaccine passport regime .\nThere is no doubt that the chief purpose of this new regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening to withhold basic right and freedoms .\nThe Times story explains how the NHS App was conveniently positioned already for its seamless upgrade to serve as a vaccine passport : It is understood that the government wants to give people the option of showing either vaccination status or test results to ensure that the scheme not does penalise those who can not receive the vaccine for health reasons .\nHealth chiefs are looking at using the existing NHS app to

appointment booking app would be relatively straightforward to use .\nThe app already allows people to see their medical records \u2014 including Covid-19 vaccinations \u2014 and test results are shared with the GP databases it uses , making it feasible to upload and access them quickly .\nGovernment health officials appear to be using conciliatory language to make it appear as if there is still a chance \u2019 of not approving it , claiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethical and clinical questions \u201d that need to be reviewed by the likes of Gove , but this is clearly not the main focus .\nFor the government , it \u2019 s now clear that their primary focus is a technocracy issue , like whether users will be able \u2018 input and verify \u2019 the results of a new COVID \u2018 lateral flow \u2019 test carried out from home .\nAlso , the Government is claiming to be seriously considering what they are calling \u2018 broader issues \u2019 which should be rightly referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as whether people could be denied access to purchasing food , getting medical care , or being allowed to work unless they can prove their Covid-19 testing or vaccine status .\nThat is beside the question of whether this medical martial law regime will also be used to refused entry to theatres , pubs , hotels , bus and train stations , and other public places .\nWhen asked about this , Boris Johnson is clearly headging his answers , and not very convincingly at that , half-heartedly admitting that , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app ] but other people will think there \u2019 s a case for it \u201d , and reassured the media that Gove would somehow be \u201c getting the best scientific , moral , philosophical and ethical viewpoints on it and will work out a way forward.\n\u201d In other words : \u2018 trust us , we \u2019 ll let you know what we think is best , and get back to you after we decide to roll-out the plan.\n\u2019 According to The Times , it \u2019 s already in the works : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 date pencilled in for a full reopening of the economy and Johnson said yesterday : \u201c There are deep and complex issues that we need to explore , and ethical issues about what the role is for government in mandating or for people to have such a thing or indeed in banning from people doing such a thing .\nWe can \u2019 t be discriminatory against people who for whatever reason can \u2019 t have the vaccine.\n\u201d However , Number 10 believes that including test results would get round this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be another way of showing that someone is at much lower risk of passing on the virus if allowed to a festival or other crowded place .\nNeither that nor vaccination is regarded as 100 per cent proof that someone can not be infectious .\nIn November the head of Test and Trace , Baroness Harding of Winscombe , said that she was \u201c working very closely with the vaccine team to make sure that as we build tools that will enable people to be testing themselves at home .\n.\n.\nwe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have the opportunity in the future to be able to have a single record as a citizen of your test results and whether you \u2019 ve been vaccinated \u201d .\nThe government is also considering incorporating facial recognition : The NHS app uses facial verification technology developed by iProov , a company that was given a \u00a375,000 grant by the arms-length government agency InnovateUK to look into vaccine passports .\nSpeaking to The Times before the government \u2019 s review of Covid-19 status certification was announced , Andrew Bud , iProov \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department of health and social care had a \u201c pivotal role \u201d to play in deciding whether it was willing to allow its existing databases to be used to develop

EU \u2019 s own Green New Deal to succeed , \u201c a certain degree of eco-dictatorship will be necessary.\n\u201d Needless to say , the implications of this are far-reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society and the political economy .\nAs this author aptly points out , in order to achieve carbon neutral by 2050 , Europe \u2019 s economy and entire political and legal systems will have to be fundamentally altered .\nAn analysis published by Deutsche Bank sharply criticises the \u201c dishonest debate \u201d with which the EU is selling its \u201c Green Deal \u201d to the people of Europe .\nThe massive risks of the project for prosperity , the economic system and democracy itself should not be concealed , but should be addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economist at Deutsche Bank Research , warns that Europe \u2019 s Green Deal and its goal of climate neutrality by 2050 threatens a European mega-crisis , leading to \u201c noticeable loss of welfare and jobs \u201d .\nAnd he warns : It won \u2019 t work without \u201c a certain degree of eco-dictatorship \u201d .\nThe analyst describes it as dubious that the Green Deal is being touted across the board as \u201c a new growth strategy \u201d which would allow the EU to become a \u201c fair and prosperous society.\n\u201d While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heymann writes , in order to achieve carbon neutral by 2050 , Europe \u2019 s economy and its entire political and legal systems will have to be changed fundamentally .\nFor the time being , the revolutionary consequences of the EU \u2019 s climate agenda for everyday life are \u201c still relatively abstract \u201d and for most households \u201c still acceptable.\n\u201d Soon , however , the path towards climate neutrality will require drastic interventions in the choice of means of transport , the size of housing , the means of heating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as restrictions in the consumption of meat and tropical fruits .\nAnd he warns these restrictions and infringements will inevitably trigger \u201c massive political resistance.\n\u201d Below are excerpts of Eric Heymann \u2019 s ( Deutsche Bank Research ) analysis .\nClimate neutrality : Are we ready for an honest discussion ?\nA certain degree of eco-dictatorship will be necessary The impact of the current climate policy on people \u2019 s everyday lives is still quite abstract and acceptable for many households .\nClimate policy comes in the form of higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make heating and mobility more expensive .\nSome countries have set minimum energy efficiency standards for buildings or similar rules in other areas .\nHowever , climate policy does not determine our lives .\nWe take key consumption decisions , for example whether we travel at all , how much we travel and which means of transport we use , whether we live in a large house or a small apartment and how we heat our homes , how many electronic devices we have and how intensely we use them or how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These decisions tend to be made on the basis of our income , not on climate considerations .\nIf we really want to achieve climate neutrality , we need to change our behaviour in all these areas of life .\nThis is simply because there are no adequate cost-effective technologies yet to allow us to maintain our living standards in a carbon-neutral way .\nThat means that carbon prices will have to rise considerably in order to nudge people to change their behaviour .\nAnother ( or perhaps supplementary ) option is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c ecodictatorship \u201d is a nasty word .\nBut we may have to ask ourselves the question whether and to what extent we may be willing to accept some kind of eco-dictatorship ( in the form of regulatory law ) in order to move towards climate neutrality .\nHere is an example : What should we do if property owners do not want to turn their houses into zero-emission buildings ; if they do not have the financial means to do so ; if doing so is not possible for technical reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay off ?\nLoss of competitiveness or restrictions to free trade If the EU moves considerably more quickly towards climate neutrality than the rest of the world , carbon prices in the EU will rise more rapidly , too .\nThis will reduce the competitiveness of energy-intensive companies in the EU .\nAre we willing to pay that price ?\nProbably not \u2013 remember , nobody is to be left behind .\nSo will we subsidise these companies to enable them to use expensive , but climate-friendly technology ?\nThis option will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to budget constraints .\nAn honest discussion will have to deal with the truth that each euro spent on climate protection is no longer available for expenses on education , research , public health , digital infrastructure , domestic and external security , tax cuts or higher pensions .\nThe EU commission plans to introduce a carbon border adjustment system to address the competition problem .\nDo we really believe that doing so will not make the affected countries introduce countermeasures ?\nAre we really willing to give up the advantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nNobody is to be left behind on the path towards climate neutrality .\nThis statement from the Green Deal probably amounts to trying to square the circle .\nA major turnaround in climate policy will certainly produce losers among both households and corporates .\nIn addition , prosperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably .\nIf this was not the case , climate protection would be an easy undertaking .\nThese developments will obviously have an impact on the political landscape , both at the national and EU level .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection policies if the latter lead to a significant increase in energy prices or to restrictions of personal freedom or ownership rights .\nAnd let us not fool ourselves : these parties will find voter support .\nAt the EU level , there will be major conflicts about distribution , which may contribute to ( further ) divisions within the bloc .\nAre we ready to deal with this polarisation ?\nOr will we adjust our climate policy ambitions if we find that ( overly ) ambitious climate policies are not acceptable to @

"title": "Imperial Folly: Neil Ferguson Has No Qualification in Biological Sciences", "content": "This is undoubtedly one of the most extraordinary stories of the entire \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 which has turned the world upside down over the twelve months .\nIn an article published by Lockdown Skeptics by Derek Winton entitled , The Imperial Model and its Role in the UK \u2019 s Pandemic Response , the author rightly calls into questions to relevant scientific experience of who is arguably the UK government \u2019 s most consequential science advisor of the COVID crisis \u2013 the notorious Neil Ferguson from Imperial College .\nIndeed , it was Ferguson who created the original fictional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and mainstream media that COVID would somehow cause over 500,000 deaths in Britain unless the government \u2018 acted swiftly \u2019 to institute harsh \u2018 mitigation \u2019 measures such as lockdowns , or as Freddie Sayers of UnHerd describes , a \u201c forecast that in a scenario without interventions , 81 % of the UK population would become infected , and that 0.9 % of them would die , ie 510,000 fatalities .\nThat , famously , was the scenario that bounced the UK government into changing its approach.\n\u201d Like with previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , and yet here we are again .\nThe lockdowns that followed last March have decimated the British economy and society , and in only 12 months has nearly destroyed the country \u2019 s education system .\nIt has led to one totalitarian policy after another , and with no end in sight \u2013 even though the alleged \u2018 novel \u2019 coronavirus in question was only a seasonal respiratory virus , and as proven statistically now \u2013 this coronavirus not at all lethal or a danger to the general population , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly with multiple chronic health conditions .\nDespite his epics failures , he still sits on the government \u2019 s venerated SAGE science conclave .\nNot surprisingly , these high priests of The Science have been wrong about every aspect of the pandemic since day one of the crisis .\nBut it \u2019 s not just problems with performance and competency , there is also the question of expertise .\nWhat makes Ferguson an expert on viruses ?\nIt is here that Winton questions his qualifications , commenting , \u201c The expertise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguably it \u2019 s the only thing that is relevant .\nSo let \u2019 s look at the qualifications of our expert.\n\u201d As it turns out , Ferguson hold no formal qualifications at all in the biological sciences \u2013 not as a microbiologist , a virologist , nor as an epidemiologist or biological statistician .\nInstead he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics ( 1990 ) from Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford , followed by his Doctorate of Philosophy in theoretical physics ( 1994 ) form Linacre College , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which repeated describe Ferguson as \u2018 one of the country \u2019 s top epidemiologists \u2019 \u2013 are quite misleading .\nWhile Ferguson has worked on lots of computer modelling and abstract simulations for various epidemics ( and wildly inaccurate on many of them ) , he is not at all qualified to warrant any authoritative cach\u00e9 in field of biological science .\nHe shouldn \u2019 t be anyway , and yet he is .\nIt \u2019 s a strange situation to say the least .\nAs with so many thing in media and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check .\nWinton reveals , \u201c In an interview on the BBC \u2019 s Life Scientific , Ferguson conceded to not having an A-level in Biology .\nAs far as publicly available information is accurate , he appears to have no formal training in computer modelling , medicine or epidemiology either.\n\u201d But it \u2019 s actually much worse than that .\nMany recoiled in horror after another Times in December 2020 when Ferguson openly admitted that he was guided ( inspired ? )\nby the unprecedented actions of the Chinese Communist Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of social control to supposedly contain COVID in Wuhan province in early 2020 .\n\u201c I think people \u2019 s sense of what is possible in terms of control changed quite dramatically between January and March , \u201d he said .\nAccording to Ferguson , both he and and the UK government \u2019 s increasingly shaky SAGE science committee regarded China experimental totalitarian lockdown policy as \u201c innovative intervention \u201d : \u201c It \u2019 s a communist one party state , we said .\nWe couldn \u2019 t get away with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy did it .\nAnd we realised we could.\n\u201d \u201c If China had not done it , \u201d he said , \u201c the year would have been very different.\n\u201d This proves beyond any doubt that this science team entrusted by the UK government actually had no idea what they were doing at the time , and that there was no scientific basis at all for instituting draconian lockdown measures .\nIt was all guesswork policy , and highly destructive at that .\nPolicy which remains in place to this day .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the celebrated computer model which Ferguson used to invent the outlandish death predictions was not even fit for purpose .\nAmong other problems , it completely left out seasonality as a variable in projecting the progress of a pandemic .\nLockdown Skeptics and author Derek Winton go on to chronicle some of Ferguson \u2019 s other past failure , leading even the casual observer to question how it was possible that he has been allowed to be involved in any government advisory position .\nIn addition to these debacles , Ferguson as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the disastrous Foot and Mouth disease crisis \u2013 which sparked the mass-culling of farm animals during the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic which cost the country billions of pounds , with most rural areas never recovering from the over-the-top government intervention .\nIncompetent and unqualified , and he \u2019 s still employed .\nThat \u2019 s your pandemic in a nutshell .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR WINTER FUNDRAISING DRIVE HERE", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

despite various public denials by UK ministers it has been revealed that the Government is indeed planning to roll-out a new Vaccine Passport , and will be using the NHS COVID Track & Trace App as the

the COVID vaccine does not actually provide immunity ) .\nAfter managing to sneak this unprecedented bio-surveillance measure under the radar for months , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious push-back by virtue of the fact a Vaccine Passport is a total abrogation of constitutional , civil and human rights .\nCertainly , on a domestic level this would be draconian in the extreme \u2013 potentially restricting access to shops , transport , schools and other venues on the basis of one \u2019 s vaccine status .\nBut for international travel , it \u2019 s now abundantly clear that governments are already colluding in order to normalise what can only be described as a new level of social control and medical fascism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelers , conspiring governments are seeing to be providing what looks like a conciliatory gesture for travelers between regime countries by allowing the \u2018 non-vaccinated \u2019 to bypass Vaccine Passport control by taking a COVID test .\nIf they negative , they will then be allowed to pass through unhindered .\nThis includes use of the wildly inaccurate and arbitrary PRC Test .\nThis is exactly what the UK and Greece governments have quietly cooked-up , proposing what is an illegal regulation behind the backs of the population \u2013 without any public debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is literally pharmaceutical fascism by administrative fiat .\nWith summer rapidly approaching , and millions suffering under repressive lockdown measures , the governments have already engineered an artificial supply ( freedom ) and demand ( holiday travel ) for this new policy which they are in completely control of .\nThe British government \u2019 s convenient excuse for falling into this seemingly \u2018 unavoidable \u2019 situation is that a vaccine passport is \u201c going to come on the international stage whatever \u201d for foreign travel as \u201c other countries would insist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no alternative.\n\u2019 This is patently untrue , but by employing this policy by stealth and laundering via \u2018 other countries \u2019 politicians can safely push the illegal vaccine passport regime without ever having to take a legal or ethical position on it \u2013 in effect , creating a de facto standard by fiat .\nBy pushing ahead in a bilateral fashion , the UK and Greek governments have created a political juggernaut \u2013 an artificial accelerator designed to pressure Brussels to \u2018 move quicker on the issue \u2019 and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue .\nThe headlines are proving that this is exactly what the UK and

have begun to take this all for granted .\nThe impact of this technology in orbit on our ability to engage in commerce and maintain military preparedness has become so vital over the past several decades that nations have begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaceborne capabilities , but also creating the ability to monitor threats in space and develop methods to defend against them .\nThis has led to several

into Earth orbit and beyond .\nChina has begun launching as many , if not more rockets per year than the United States .\nIts capabilities range from placing entire satellite constellations into orbit , to launching its own astronauts and even space station segments , as well as commercial missions for clients from around the globe .\nRussia continues to develop its space launch capabilities and currently still has these most reliable manned space launch systems on Earth \u2013 the Soyuz .\nTheir plans to develop reusable rockets to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Russia too remains a significant

colonize Mars .\nAnd just beyond reach of current technology are resources in space in the form of minerals and ore on the Moon and trapped in near-Earth objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a multi-trillion dollar space economy that could sustain a population within our solar system many times larger than the 7.6 billion people on Earth today .\nThrough this now quickly shifting and rapidly developing space industry we can see the stage being set for a new , and much more wide-ranging \u201c space race \u201d for the 21st century .\nWhile the first space race was bipolar \u2013 between the United States and the Soviet Union \u2013 today \u2019 s new space race includes old adversaries \u2013 the US and Russia \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even Iran .\nThere are also a growing number of private space companies from US-based firms like Elon Musk \u2019 s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos \u2019 Blue Origin , to Japan \u2019 s iSpace , and Galactic Energy in China .\nThere is a very real space-based economy already .\nIt consists of constellations of satellites providing everything from communication to navigational services \u2013 services that are playing an increasingly important role in the global economy .\nIndustries like delivery services heavily depend on satellite navigation to connect drivers with their destinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allowing customers to track their progress in real-time .\nFood delivery alone is an industry of over $ 100 billion worldwide .\nThere are also taxi services that increasingly rely on satellite navigation to find and deliver passengers .\nThe growing importance of satellite navigation for the economy is only set to grow as companies around the globe explore the possibility of drone delivery services and modes of land transportation that are increasingly autonomous .\nCommunication satellites have long served an important role in advancing and connecting modern information technology .\nSatellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already available around the world .\nThese services depend on satellites in higher orbits over the Earth meaning that latency is higher \u2013 and internet speeds slower .\nGeostationary orbits , while higher and providing slower communication speeds , require fewer satellites to cover any particular area \u2013 with specific satellites assigned to and stationed permanently over a single region of the planet .\nCommunication satellites in low earth orbit can not remain over a single region of the planet permanently .\nThey are constantly moving , and thus to create worldwide coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocols meant to relay signals not only from the ground to orbit , but between satellites in orbit are required \u2013 and in large numbers .\nThe lowering costs of both satellite manufacturing and space launches to place them into orbit makes this possible today .\nWith SpaceX \u2019 s Starlink service , consisting of thousands of satellites in low earth orbit ( and eventually tens of thousands of satellites ) , low latency satellite internet will be available worldwide with a partial network already being tested .\nOther companies are attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including OneWeb and Amazon \u2019 s Project Kuiper .\nRussia \u2019 s Roscosmos is planning to create a similar constellation and China via its Hongyun project is already launching satellites in a bid to create its own low earth orbit broadband internet constellation .\nThese would constitute global internet service providers \u2013 though satellites would still depend on ground stations that connected to the physical backbone of the Internet in order to receive and transmit data \u2013 and companies involved in proposing and building these constellations are designing custom tailored solutions on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age where information warfare is as serious a threat as actual warfare .\nThere are also clear military implications regarding satellite navigation and communication .\nIts use on the battlefield includes collecting intelligence , coordinating the locations of and communication between troops in the field , guiding warships at sea as well as warplanes overhead , guiding munitions accurately to their targets and for managing the growing fleet of unmanned military vehicles on land , in the air , and both on and under the sea .\nThe obvious importance of satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s economy and its defense is why nations like the United States , Russia , China , and the EU have developed their own networks that they control and that they can not be excluded from .\nThese are networks that they can offer access to for allies and customers , to enhance their alliances and to open up streams of revenue .\nThe United States maintains the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) with a constellation of 31 satellites .\nThe maintenance and protection of America \u2019 s GPS satellites was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRussia maintains the Global Navigation Satellite System ( GLONASS ) with 24 satellites in orbit .\nThe EU \u2019 s Galileo network also consists of 24 satellites .\nChina recently completed its BeiDou network with 35 satellites in orbit \u2013 the largest network of its kind and one of several key indicators illustrating not only how serious China takes this new space race , but the competence it is able to bring to it .\nThe BeiDou network has already become a key component of China \u2019 s One Belt , One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China is using to help stitch together the economies of Eurasia and to help augment the military capabilities of its allies \u2013 including nations like Pakistan who now have access to BeiDou \u2019 s higher military-grade positioning resolution .\nSince China is building continent-spanning transportation infrastructure \u2013 creating and maintaining its own network of navigation satellites with global coverage prevents nations like the US from cutting it off from the GPS network at junctures of geopolitical tensions and potentially stranding logistical operations across entire continents .\nUnited Launch Alliance ( ULA ) \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lockheed \u2013 has proposed what it calls a \u201c cislunar

titled , \u201c ULA \u2019 s Tory Bruno argues for U.S. investments in the production of fuel in space , \u201d that economy would include mining , transportation , manufacturing and space tourism .\nSpace.com in an article titled , \u201c Inside ULA \u2019 s Plan to Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d would note just how many people would make up that economy .\nMining and in-situ manufacturing in space alone would be transformative for human civilization \u2013 akin to moving from the bronze age to the iron age .\nThe resources trapped in near earth objects dwarf the total amount of resources here on Earth .\nIt is just a matter of accessing it and possessing the tools to use it in manufacturing processes in space .\nThe science fiction future imagined in books and movies for decades could become a reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that featured in the 2013 film , \u201c Elysium , \u201d hopefully without the accompanying dystopian class divide .\nWhile ULA \u2019 s own expendable launch vehicles

edge in overall competitiveness \u2013 again because of SpaceX \u2013 and owed in particular to SpaceX \u2019 s reusable Falcon 9 launch vehicle .\nSome of its Falcon 9 boosters have flown and landed

and second stages .\nIt is designed ultimately not only to send people to Mars , but to be able to lift enough material , equipment , and people into orbit frequently enough to build a city on the red planet .\nWhile this goal remains on a more distant horizon , the cargo lift capabilities of Starship \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 and its rapid reusability will make access to space cheaper than ever before .\nIt will open up a variety of possibilities both economically and militarily for the United States and its allies , as well as for commercial partners around the world \u2013 while leaving other nations playing catch-up .\nNothing like Starship is even under development elsewhere around the globe .\nWhile China and Russia are developing heavy-lift rockets nearing Starship \u2019 s lift capabilities , none of them will be even partially reusable .\nThere is also the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system \u2013 other than Earth orbit .\nThe US , China , Russia , and Japan all possess the capability to reach the Moon , Mars , and even near earth objects like asteroids .\nIn 2020 when the most recent launch window opened to send missions to Mars , the US and China both sent major

Martian surface to Earth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as an experiment for in-situ oxygen production which will be vital for human habitation and the production of fuel on Mars in the future .\nChina \u2019 s mission \u2013 Tianwen-1 \u2013 has also reached the red planet , featuring an orbiter , a lander , and a rover .\nIf China successfully lands on the surface of Mars it will signify a major

mission has successfully collected a sample from asteroid Bennu and is slated to return it to Earth by 2023 .\nGetting into space and being able to reach a wide variety of destinations there \u2013 and being able to carry out a wide variety of activities will be key to expanding Earth \u2019 s economy into space .\nGovernment agencies and private companies are developing these capabilities at an increasingly faster pace each year with large implications regarding cooperation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe networks being placed into orbit will enhance the economic and military capabilities of the respective nations on the ground launching them .\nThe importance of creating and defending these networks is obvious .\nSatellite navigation \u2019 s use in conducting warfare and in particularly accurately guiding unmanned aircraft and even munitions across the battlefield makes it an obvious target for electronic jamming .\nHere we can see the clearest example of how geopolitical competition on Earth is extending into the domain of space .\nThe National Interest in a 2019 article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Messing with America \u2019 s F-35s , \u201d would claim : GPS is essential for US military operations \u2013 and for pilots of warplanes like the F-35 in particular \u2013 both regarding navigation and guiding munitions to target .\nJamming GPS signals in theater means partially blinding US warplanes and severely inhibiting their ability to carry out military operations .\nWhile the US has claimed this jamming is a serious provocation , Syria is a nation the US has illegally occupied for years .\nThis is in addition to its military occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article points out , its planned military aggression against Iran , all nations thousands of miles from America \u2019 s shores , and all nations that pose no direct threat to the US itself .\nThe use of America \u2019 s GPS in the Middle East is explicitly for enabling military aggression abroad \u2013 not the defense of the United States itself .\nWith the founding of the US Space Force in late 2019 , and with the new armed forces branch overseeing America \u2019 s GPS capabilities , it is certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from disrupting these capabilities overseas will become part of its mission .\nIt is clear that the US Space Force will be used \u2013 not to defend the United States itself \u2013 but to prevent others from defending themselves from US aggression and its spaceborne capabilities used to enable it .\nRussia \u2019 s use of electronic jamming has complicated American aggression in the Middle East .\nBut there are other threats to America \u2019 s spaceborne capabilities \u2013 and theoretically , to those of all other nations as well .\nIn 2007 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ASAT ) missile which destroyed one of its aging Fengyun series weather satellites , the West vocally protested \u2013 so much so \u2013 that many might believe China was the first ever to carry out such a test .\nIn reality , the US conducted a very similar test as early as 1985 using an ASM-135 ASAT missile mounted on an F-15 Eagle fighter aircraft .\nThe missile was used to destroy the Solwind P78-1 satellite \u2013 a scientific platform nearing the end of its lifespan .\nThe early US test \u2013 like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debris that posed a hazard to other satellites and spacecraft in orbit .\nThe US test even delayed the construction of what is now the International Space Station ( ISS ) .\nAfter the Chinese test in 2007 \u2013 and despite the US already demonstrating its ability to destroy satellites in orbit \u2013 the US carried out an additional ASAT mission a year later using a modified SM-3 missile to destroy the USA-193 reconnaissance satellite operated by the US National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) .\nWhile the mission was justified by claiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could enter the atmosphere and cause contamination with its highly toxic fuel \u2013 the timing following the Chinese missile test made it clear this story was just cover for what was a tit-for-tat demonstration vis-a-vis China and a test of US missile defense systems as provocative as the US claimed China \u2019 s test was .\nRussia began testing modern ASAT missiles in 2015 , conducting several tests but none of them directed at actually destroying a satellite in orbit .\nIndia \u2013 a nation with an increasingly capable space program \u2013 tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test satellite in low earth orbit ( LEO ) .\nIn other words , several nations now possess the ability to not only jam satellites but also destroy them .\nFor nations like the US who depend heavily on its GPS network when fighting wars of aggression abroad \u2013 the destruction of even parts of its GPS network would immediately impact its fighting capacity and require a time consuming and expensive process to replace lost satellites .\nThe advent of ASAT systems has increased the cost of US military aggression abroad should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or China decide to begin targeting this crucial component of American military might .\nOn the other hand , US-based SpaceX \u2013 should its Starship launch vehicle begin placing payloads into orbit , it would be capable of replacing entire constellations faster than they could be shot down .\nHere , we can see the potential ingredients for a space-based arms race .\nShould ULA \u2019 s cislunar economy \u2013 or a version of it \u2013 begin to take shape , it will be difficult to imagine how economics in orbit and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will inevitably arise will take full shape .\nIt may resemble in many ways the process of exploring for and exploiting hydrocarbons here on Earth with a process of staking and exploiting claims clearly defined and competitors moving on to other objects in search for resources .\nIf current studies of near earth objects are accurate , there would be more resources in space than human civilization has the ability to fully exploit \u2013 although real estate on the Moon or Mars , or specific asteroids in closer proximity to Earth would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and possible conflict .\nConflict might be fought out on Earth between respective nations over what is happening in space or a new class of weapons and tactics might be developed for use in space-to-space combat .\nHere on Earth we can already see attempts by the US to pressure nations like Iran and hinder the development of Iran \u2019 s space program \u2013 which has already successfully placed payloads into orbit and is developing more capable launch vehicles as well as its own satellites to place in orbit .\nDenial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space may become common themes in near-future warfare .\nCooperation in space or exclusion of certain nations from specific projects has already become a geopolitical tool .\nRussia \u2019 s monopoly over manned space launches \u2013 only recently broken by SpaceX \u2019 s crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft \u2013 was a useful tool for Moscow to remind America of the limits of its omnipotence .\nAmerica \u2019 s plans for a Lunar Gateway station now exclude Russia \u2013 a politically-motivated decision that will cost America in terms of technical expertise can capabilities Russia could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion of China from virtually all cooperation with NASA including on the International Space Station would at first serve to hinder China \u2019 s space program \u2013 but now appears to be spurring it .\nChina now plans to launch its own space station and will use it to cooperate with any and all nations in space \u2013 including those thus far excluded by US-dominated projects .\nThese are possibilities that are no longer the domain of science fiction writers but the serious topics of policymakers and the aerospace branches of national armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moon bases , Mars rovers , space stations , rockets taking off and landing under the power of their own engines \u2013 are fast becoming a reality or in some cases , are already here .\nThe new space race has begun and it is a race a growing number of nations and companies are joining on a nearly monthly basis .\nRockets are taking off from traditional launch sites in Florida and Kazakhstan \u2013 but also now from places like New Zealand and Amur Oblast in eastern Russia .\nSpaceX is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , near America \u2019 s border with Mexico .\nAnd China is constructing new launch facilities on land and at sea .\nThe scale and importance of activity in space is expanding rapidly , with ever-expanding rewards of the wealth , power and influence for its participants .\nWherever there are people and resources \u2013 there will be competition , and in this new space race we will likely see this competition move beyond flag-planting and toward something that resembles actual conflict .\n*** VIDEO : Amazon founder Jeff Bezos presents his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of outer space .\nWatch : Author Brian Berletic , formerly known under his pen name Tony Cartalucci ,

Were Duped.", "content": "Because the PCR test can not discern between live virus and dead , noninfectious viral debris , the timing of the test ends up being important .\nOne example of this was presented in a letter to the editor of The New England Journal of Medicine , in which the author describes an investigation done on hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Seoul , South Korea .\nWhereas the median time from symptom onset to viral clearance confirmed by cultured samples was just seven days , with the longest time frame being 12 days , the PCR test continued to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe shortest time between symptom onset to a negative PCR test was 24 days .\nIn other words , there was no detectable live virus in patients after about seven days from onset of symptoms ( at most 12 days ) .\nThe PCR test , however , continued to register them as \u201c positive \u201d for SARS-CoV-2 for about 34 days .\nThe reason this matters is because if you have no live virus in your body , you are not infectious and pose no risk to others .\nThis then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , day 12 to be safe , after symptom onset is pointless , as any positive result is likely to be false .\nBut there \u2019 s more .\nAs noted in that New England Journal of Medicine article : \u201c Viable virus was identified until 3 days after the resolution in fever \u2026 Viral culture was positive only in samples with a cycle-threshold value of 28.4 or less .\nThe incidence of culture positivity decreased with an increasing time from symptom onset and with an increasing cycle-threshold value.\n\u201d This suggests symptomology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle .\nIf no viable virus is detectable beyond day 3 after your fever ends , it \u2019 s probably unnecessary to retest beyond that point .\nA positive result beyond day 3 after your fever breaks is , again , likely to be a false positive , as you have to have live virus in order to be infectious .\nEven more important , these results reconfirm that CTs above 30 are inadvisable as they \u2019 re highly likely to be wrong .\nHere , they found the CT had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test to correspond with live virus .\nAs noted by the authors : \u201c Our findings may be useful in guiding isolation periods for patients with Covid-19 and in estimating the risk of secondary transmission among close contacts in contract tracing.\n\u201d To circle back to the Curative PCR test , the company argues that the test is accurate when it comes to detecting active infection , and as CEO Fred Turner told Buzzfeed : \u201c If you \u2019 re screening for a return to work and you \u2019 re picking up everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one \u2019 s going to return to work .\nIf you want to detect active COVID , what the \u2018 early \u2019 study shows is that Curative is highly effective at doing that.\n\u201d Again , this has to do with the fact that the Curative spit test has a sensitivity resembling that of a nasopharyngeal PCR set at a CT of 30 .\nThe lower CT count narrows the pool of positive results to include primarily those with higher viral loads and those who are more likely to actually carry live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat the FDA wants Curative to do is to widen that net so that more noninfectious individuals can be labeled as a \u201c case.\n\u201d In an email to Buzzfeed , Dr. Michael Mina , an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H .\nChan School of Public Health , stated that using a CT of 45 is \u201c absolutely insane , \u201d because at that magnification , you may be looking at a single RNA molecule , whereas \u201c when people are sick and are contagious , they literally can have 1,000,000,000,000x that number.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCR test \u201c would potentially detect someone 35 days post-infection who is fully recovered and cause that person to have to enter isolation .\nThat \u2019 s crazy and it \u2019 s not science-based , it \u2019 s not medicine-based and it \u2019 s not public health-oriented.\n\u201d While the FDA has issued a warning not to use the Curative spit test on asymptomatic people , Florida has dismissed the warning and will continue to use the test on symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals alike .\nOnly Miami-Dade County is reconsidering how it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision has yet to be announced .\nThe lower the CT , the greater the accuracy While the FDA claims high sensitivity ( meaning higher CT ) is required to ensure we don \u2019 t end up with asymptomatic spreaders in our communities , as reviewed above , this risk is exceedingly small .\nWe really need to stop panicking about the possibility of healthy people killing others .\nIt \u2019 s not a sane trend , as detailed in \u201c The World Is Suffering from Mass Delusional Psychosis.\n\u201d According to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases , to get 100 % confirmed real positives , the PCR test must be run at just 17 cycles .\nAbove 17 cycles , accuracy drops dramatically .\nBy the time you get to 33 cycles , the accuracy rate is a mere 20 % , meaning 80 % are false positives .\nBeyond 34 cycles , your chance of a positive PCR test being a true positive shrinks to zero .\nSimilarly , a Dec. 3 , 2020 , systematic review published in the journal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings of 29 different studies , found that \u201c CT values were significantly lower \u2026 in specimens producing live virus culture.\n\u201d In other words , the higher the CT , the lower the chance of a positive test actually being due to the presence of live ( and infectious ) virus .\n\u201c Two studies reported the odds of live virus culture reduced by approximately 33 % for every one unit increase in CT , \u201d the authors noted .\nImportantly , five of the studies included were unable to identify any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCR test had used a CT above 24 .\nIn cases where a CT above 35 was used , the patient had to be symptomatic in order to obtain a live virus culture .\nThis again confirms that PCR with a CT over 35 really shouldn \u2019 t be used on asymptomatic people , as any positive result is likely to be meaningless and simply force them into isolation for no reason .\nIn closing , the whole premise of PCR testing to diagnose COVID-19 is in serious question , as the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper that didn \u2019 t even undergo peer-review before being implemented worldwide .\nNov. 30 , 2020 , a team of 22 international scientists published a review challenging the scientific paper on PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 written by Christian Drosten , Ph.D. , and Victor Corman ( the so-called \u201c Corman-Drosten paper \u201d ) .\nAccording to Reiner Fuellmich , founding member of the German Corona Extra-Parliamentary Inquiry Committee mentioned at the beginning of this article , Drosten is a key culprit in the COVID-19 pandemic hoax .\nThe scientists demanded the Corman-Drosten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors , \u201d one of which is the fact that it was written , and the test itself developed , before any viral isolate was available .\nThe test is simply based on a partial genetic sequence published online by Chinese scientists in January 2020 .\nIn an undercover DC interview , Kevin Corbett , Ph.D. , one of the 22 scientists who are now demanding the paper \u2019 s retraction , stated : \u201c Every scientific rationale for the development of that test has been totally destroyed by this paper \u2026 When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t given them a viral isolate .\nThey developed the test from a sequence in a gene bank .\nDo you see ?\nChina gave them a genetic sequence with no corresponding viral isolate .\n\u201c They had a code , but no body for the code .\nNo viral morphology \u2026 the bits of the virus sequence that weren \u2019 t there they made up .\nThey synthetically created them to fill in the blanks \u2026 \u201c There are 10 fatal errors in this Drosten test paper \u2026 But here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viral isolate to validate what they were doing .\nThe PCR products of the amplification didn \u2019 t correspond to any viral isolate at that time .\nI call it \u2018 donut ring science.\n\u2019 There is nothing at the center of it .\nIt \u2019 s all about code , genetics , nothing to do with reality \u2026 \u201c There have since been papers saying they \u2019 ve produced viral isolates .\nBut there are no controls for them .\nThe CDC produced a paper in July \u2026 where they said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 Do you know what they did ?\nThey swabbed one person .\nOne person , who \u2019 d been to China and had cold symptoms .\nOne person .\nAnd they assumed he had [ COVID-19 ] to begin with .\nSo , it \u2019 s all full of holes , the whole thing.\n\u201d The critique against PCR testing is further strengthened by the Nov. 20 , 2020 , study in Nature Communications , which found no viable virus in any PCR-positive cases .\nI referenced this study earlier , noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in close contact with an asymptomatic individual ended up testing positive .\nBut that \u2019 s not all .\nAfter evaluating PCR testing data from 9,899,828 people , and conducting additional live cultures to check for active infections in those who tested positive , using a CT of 37 or lower , they were unable to detect live virus in any of them , which is a rather astonishing finding .\nOn the whole , it seems clear that mass testing using PCR is inappropriate , and does very little if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary result is simply the perpetuation of the false idea that healthy , noninfectious people can pose a mortal threat to others , and that we must avoid social interactions .\nIt \u2019 s a delusional idea that is wreaking havoc on the global psyche , and it \u2019 s time to put an end to this unhealthy , unscientific way of life .\nThis article

health officials in China are now no longer content with simply using nasal cavity and throat swabs in order to test for the illusive virus .\nFollowing a series of localized outbreaks , including in the capital city Beijing , Chinese authorities have begun deploying anal swabs to test for coronavirus .\nThe reason for the switch ?\nAllegedly , some experts believe that an anal swab test might be better at detecting the virus \u2013 despite the fact that there is no scientific evidence to suggest this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row has since erupted between China and Japan , after the Chinese bio surveillance officials ordered the anal testing of Japanese citizens visiting the country .\nThe new swab test involves inserting a cotton swab 1 to 2 inches up the subject \u2019 s rectum , then rotating the swab several times , and place the sample into a container for processing .\nSuch was the uncomfortable and humiliating nature of the procedure \u2013 that Tokyo has requested that Beijing please stop taking anal swab tests for COVID-19 of its Japanese citizens .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ says his government has not received any response from Beijing about halting the invasive procedure .\n\u201c Some Japanese reported to our embassy in China that they received anal swab tests , which caused a great psychological pain , \u201d said Kato at a recent press conference .\nIn an attempt to pursue a \u201c Zero COVID \u201d environment , the Chinese Communist Party has ordered that cities use samples taken from the anus in order to detect any potential COVID-19 infections \u2013 to make sure that no potential carrier of the coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more to this new strategy than China officials are openly admitting , namely that reason for this new procedure is to catch any supposed \u201c asymptomatic cases \u201d using a nucleic acid amplification test , otherwise know as the notorious PCR Test .\nAs Li Tongzeng , a senior doctor from Beiking \u2019 s Youan hospital , told CCTV : \u201c We found that some asymptomatic patients tend to recover quickly .\nIt \u2019 s possible that there will be no trace of the virus in their throat after three to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the virus lasts longer from the samples taken from the patient \u2019 s digestive tract and excrement , compared to the ones taken from the respiratory tract .\nIf we conduct anal swabs for nucleic acid testing , it would increase the detection rates of patients and lower the chance of a missed diagnosis.\n\u201d As a result , China will be able to harvest more false positive tests through this method \u2013 enabling health officials to quarantine more healthy people \u2013 and ultimately extending the perception of a pandemic indefinitely .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic incident to Japan \u2019 s broke out between China and the United States , after Chinese officials ordered anal swabs be taken from U.S. diplomatic there .\nThe move by Beijing was an awkward one to the least .\nIn order to avoid any undue diplomatic static over the issue , orders appear to have been given by the Biden Administration and it \u2019 s partner mainstream media outlets not to cover this story , hence the MSM blackout last week .\nThe Chinese government has promised to stop using anal swabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Washington complained that the practice was undignified , the U.S. State Department said .\n\u201c The State Department never agreed to this kind of testing and protested directly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when we learned that some staff were subject to it , \u201d a State Department spokesperson told VICE World News on Wednesday .\nThe spokesperson said Beijing had assured Washington that the test was given \u201c in error \u201d and that diplomatic personnel were exempt from the test , which was mandatory for incoming travelers in some parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff to decline this test if it is asked of them , as was done in the past.\n\u201d On Thursday afternoon , China \u2019 s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian denied Beijing had asked U.S. diplomats in China to undergo anal swab tests .\nSome Chinese regions have been ordering anal swabs for people under quarantine , including those who arrived from abroad .\nAuthorities say the tests can avoid missing infections .\nIt \u2019 s not clear how many U.S. diplomats or their family members have gone through the tests .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to preserving the \u201c dignity \u201d of American diplomats and their families , consistent with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and other diplomatic law provisions .\nIn an online post earlier in February , China \u2019 s National Health Commission said in some cases , the coronavirus can be more readily detected in anal samples than in throat and nasal samples .\nBut it acknowledged rectal swabs are not suitable for mass use because they are inconvenient and unpopular .\nAccording to the commission \u2019 s

last deployed in record numbers to the streets of Minneapolis during last summer \u2019 s riots .\n( Photo via Twitter ) ( MINNEAPOLIS , MN ) \u2013 Citizens and businesses of Minneapolis will be forced to reckon with a high street presence of the National Guard as the city prepares for the upcoming murder trial of Derek Chauvin , the disgraced ex-cop accused of killing George Floyd , with jury selection set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this past Monday \u2019 s City Council Public Briefing , it was confirmed by the Minneapolis Police Department ( MPD ) that the National Guard will be playing a key role in coordination of all city , county , state and federal law enforcement and security operations for the trial .\nAccording to a recent New York Post report , Mayor Jacob Frey said as many as 3,000 law enforcement personnel could be deployed throughout the city during the trial .\nDuring last summer \u2019 s street chaos in the city , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the violence and property destruction came under heavy criticism for its delayed response and lack of direction .\nThe criticism was largely directed at Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as businesses continued to be destroyed while the city continued to burn .\nThis time , law enforcement officials are making big promises to the public .\nMPD Commander Scott Gerlicher , who leads the Special Operation and Intelligence Division , said at the public briefing that the plan is to have two-thirds of the National Guard assigned to \u201c Property Protection Detail \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business corridors throughout the city.\n\u201d OSN will be helmed locally by Gerlicher and MPD Chief Medaria Arradondo ( pictured above ) .\nAccording to the OSN rollout plan , the main goals will be to ensure the public \u2019 s safety and protect businesses throughout the trial .\nHere \u2019 s a look at what activities are \u201c encouraged \u201d and considered \u201c unlawful \u201d : OSN will operate with a \u201c Unified Command Structure \u201d allowing the following agencies to coordinate their security fusion efforts with MPD Chief Arradondo acting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underscored in the plan , and should give the pubic an early indication of where operational resources are being spent , is when the ramp-up of \u201c full deployment of law enforcement and National Guard begins \u201d \u2013 according to the OSN it will begin during the closing arguments and verdict phase of the trial , as indicated in the slide below : Also prominent in the OSN , protection and safety measures to allow people to exercise their constitutional rights to free speech and peaceful demonstration .\nChief Arradondo has indicated he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around \u2013 something his department was largely unable to achieve as violence

abolitionists \u2019 are already warning would-be demonstrators \u2018 Don \u2019 t Get Caged \u2019 \u2013 a reference to what they are calling \u2018 free speech cages \u2019 ( see image above ) set up around the perimeter of the courthouse plaza designed to \u2018 kettle \u2019 protesters .\nHennepin County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial will convene in courtroom C-1856 , has already been heavily fortified with concrete barriers and barbed wire security fencing in anticipation of large crowds of protesters .\nHere \u2019 s a good look at the security infrastructure deployed around the government plaza : Communications will also play a key role in ensuring the public safety during the trial .\nCity officials have created an organizational structure for communications called the \u201c Join Information System \u201d ( JIS ) that includes OSN , illustrated in the diagram below : In the JIS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all law enforcement and fire communications .\nThere will also be a set of approved communication channels , both public and private , coordinated by the city for disseminating information about the trial and public safety .\nThese include weekly media briefings and social media .\nOne proposal , that eventually received backlash and got nixed from the communications plan , was to pay \u2018 local influencers \u2019 on social media to spread the city \u2019 s message about the trial and more .\nDavid Rubedor , the city \u2019 s community relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference : It didn \u2019 t take long for this fantasy proposal to get shut down : While city officials have spent the last eight months preparing for the high-profile trial , it is still unknown exactly who , and how many will ultimately show up for street actions .\nIn total , expect to see at least a dozen different protest group take to the streets of Minneapolis and beyond .\nBesides Black Lives Matter , the following groups are being deployed Democrat and other leftwing and foundation-funded political action organizations : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Climate Justice Committee , Communities United Against Police Brutality , Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence , Freedom Road Socialist Organization \u2013 Twin Cities , Good Trouble for Justice , MN Immigrant Rights Action Committee , MN Uprising Arrestee Support , MN Workers United , Native Lives Matter , On Site Public Media , Racial Justice Network , Students for Democratic Society at UMN , Twin Cities Coalition 4 Justice 4 Jamar , Women Against Military Madness , and more to come .\nPictured above : A masked Mayor Frey prostrates to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 , after calls to \u2018 defund the police \u2019 began to explode across the city and country .\n\u201c We will not be denied , we will not move back , we will not be afraid , but we will stand up , and we will continue to protest .\nWe will continue to take to the streets , \u201d said activist Nekema Levy-Pounds .\n\u201c These barricades , and all this fencing and barbed wire will not stop us from getting in the streets , and speaking truth to power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our community be set free from police violence and unnecessary harassment.\n\u201d It \u2019 s interesting to note how the Democrat and the Progressive left \u2019 s BLM/Antifa tent is expanding with new subgroups like Don \u2019 t Get Caged .\nThe Democratic Party machine is still keen to cultivate social justice street actions in order to harvest political capital , but the leadership do not want to be tarred with any negative associations with violent Antifa mobs , or radical BLM cells taking over government buildings or city blocks as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 .\nSo it makes sense that this new street action coalition is being rebranded for the Chauvin Trial , adding a couple new brands into the Media mix \u2013 something which mainstream media pundits love , but which also help to dilute the focus on mainstream Democratic Party umbrella networks like MoveOn.org , as well as the outright Marxist affiliations which some of the activist groups have .\nIn terms of radical social justice activist groups , the introduction of rebranded subgroups or affiliates is also useful if a more high-profile organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance between itself and any of the extremist actions it is planning to carry out .\nIn order to protect the parent brand and its lucrative funding streams , new cut-out organizations have been launched in order to run street agitation for the Chauvin Trial .\nIn this case , following a summer of rioting in 2020 , BLM built-up a sizeable multi-million dollar war chest thanks to patronage and generous donations from Silicon Valley and America \u2019 s top corporations like Google , Facebook and Walmart , to name only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlets will still focus on BLM and Antifa , while Democrat-oriented outlets like CNN , MSNBC , New York Times and Washington Post will steer away from BLM and Antifa and draw attention to other and new activist groups , particularly if violence , arson , looting and general rioting ensues .\nWith the \u201c George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020 \u201d passing the U.S. House of Representatives and now being considered by the Senate , one can only imagine just how hyper-politicized the jury selection and trial of Derek Chauvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bottom , Federal to local .\nEven the initial juror questionnaire that the court sent out to potential jurors was laden with social justice themes \u2013 setting the stage for what looks to be a dominant narrative the prosecution will pursue in this case .\nThe trial will be televised \u201c gavel-to-gavel \u201d with Court TV being the only network with cameras in the courtroom \u2013 serving as the central feed for all other media outlets .\nThe trial will also be live-streamed across the Internet to global audiences .\nTo get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being packaged to the public , just watch your local or national media .\nOr , this Court TV video trailer for the event , where the legal cable network appears to be going full \u2018 BLM \u2019 for their trial coverage : Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter for the death of Floyd , and had another charge of third-degree murder thrown out last fall by presiding Judge Peter Cahill .\nProsecutors are now making a last-ditch effort to reinstate the third-degree murder charge , and they just might succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Judge Cahill \u2019 s prior decision to toss out the additional murder charge to be erroneous and have sent the issue back to district court to be added to the charging sheet prior to jury selection .\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison , the state \u2019 s top cop , has been pushing hard to get the third-degree murder charge re-instated .\nHe will lead the prosecution \u2019 s case against Chauvin and promises to \u2018 get justice \u2019 for George Floyd .\nLast summer , AG Ellison , in the wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend his son Jeremiah Ellison \u2019 s \u2018 pro-Antifa \u2019 tweet : The younger Ellison , who currently serves the 5th Ward of Minneapolis as a City Council Member , has

clinical presentation , a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology .\nWHO reminds IVD users that disease prevalence alters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease prevalence decreases , the risk of false positive increases ( 2 ) .\nThis means that the probability that a person who has a positive result ( SARS-CoV-2 detected ) is truly infected with SARS-CoV-2

( the proverbial Kemalists ) still manage to linger on .\nIn this connection , some time ago , a very momentous anniversary took place in Turkey \u2013 on 28 February , to be precise .\nBack in 1997 , a so-called \u2018 post-modern \u2019 coup took place on that date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process \u2019 ( a final futile attempt to revive the Kemalist ideology ) that has left deep and long-lasting marks in

pro-Islamist and anti-democratic \u201d tendencies .\nBasically , the Turkish Army , as the self-proclaimed \u2018 Guardian of Turkish Secularism \u2019 put a stop to the political life of Necmetttin Erbakan ( 1926-2011 ) and his latest vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translated as the Welfare Party ) .\nAnd , at the time , a popular saying was doing the rounds about this \u2019 28 February process , \u2019 indicating that \u201c [ i ] t effects will last for a thousand years , if need be , \u201d which was based on a statement made by General H\u00fcseyin K\u0131vr\u0131ko\u011flu .\nAs the \u201c Islamist-rooted AKP , in power since 2002 , emerged from the Welfare Party , \u201d worded by the BBC , this anniversary seems particularly poignant and even significant today .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ centenary of the Turkish Republic \u2019 s foundation in two years \u2019 time .\nThe political scientist Dr \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00f6kmen has even termed the \u2019 28 February process \u2019 an attempted \u201c restoration of Westernization , \u201d as the Turkish Armed Forces ( TSK ) tried to revive Kemalist principles as the political lifeblood of the land , liberally wielding the term \u2018 irtica \u2018 in the process .\nThis originally Arabic term used to denote religious reaction or simply Islamic fundamentalism in a Turkish context , but nearly a quarter century later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turkish vocabulary .\nA circumstance that can only be explained by the fact that the country has been led by the blatantly Islamist Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ( aka the Prez ) and his Justice and Development Party ( or AKP ) into an openly post-Kemalist era where Islam has once again entered the political process and Turkish society as a whole has been slowly but surely weaned off supposedly secularist or merely lenient habits and attitudes \u2013 for as I argued as long ago as 2011 , in a Turkish context , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c beer and bikinis , \u201d as a shorthand for a permissive interpretation of Islamic strictures and prohibitions regulating society and social life as a whole .\nAgenda 2023 : A New Constitution for a New Turkey I have been arguing for nearly a decade now that the AKP \u201c government \u2019 s long-term goal ( as arguably expressed in the AKP \u2019 s policy statement Hedef 2023 ) is to transform the nation state Turkey into an Anatolian federation of Muslim ethnicities , possibly linked to a revived caliphate \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For in the Republic of Turkey ( established in 1923 following the signature of the Treaty of Lausanne ) , the nation \u2019 s founding father Mustafa Kemal and the Ankara government abolished Sharia law in 1926 , to replace the Islamic legal codex regulating human actions and social relations with the so-called Kanun-\u0131 Medini , itself a copy of the Swiss Code civil .\nNearly a decade ago , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s \u201c [ then- ] oft-repeated reference point [ wa ] s the first assembly of what was to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1920 [ , predating the foundation of the Republic ] .\n.\n.\nThe first assembly consisted of representatives of Anatolia \u2019 s Muslim population , the then-Kemalist constituency , who had pledged allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan-Caliph , Mehmed VI.\n\u201d Last month then , Erdo\u011fan talked about the need for a new constitution , a new constitution that takes the pre-republican 1921 constitution ( Te\u015fkilat-\u0131 Esasiye Kanunu ) as its \u201c reference point.\n\u201d As voiced by the independent news outlet Ahval , \u201c Turkey \u2019 s governing party is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the constitution.\n\u201d A constitutional referedum that could very well become a Turkish version of the Pakistani referendum held on 19 December 1984 , and that presented the population of Pakistan with the following question : \u201c Do you endorse the process initiated by the President of Pakistan , General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq , for bringing the laws of Pakistan in conformity with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet ( peace be upon him ) .\n\u201d Arguably , the wording of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t be this open-and-shut , but there is little doubt that a new Turkish Constitution would usher in an era of revived Islamic awareness that would culminate in a possible renewed implementation of Sharia Law , as seems vividly illustrated in many public displays clamouring for a revived Caliphate and reinstituted Sharia during last year \u2019 s restoration of the Aya Sofya Mosque in \u0130stanbul .\nA few months later , on 9 December 2020 to be precise , the AKP lawmaker Cengiz Aydo\u011fdu , while addressing deputies on the budget of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement : This shows that some , if not all , AKP politicians appear ready to embrace the return Sharia Law in the New Turkey .\nIn fact , already in December 2019 , the constitutional law professor Kemal G\u00f6zler has written that there are \u201c [ t ] hose who think that it is necessary for the modern legal system in Turkey to be replaced by Islamic law.\n\u201d G\u00f6zler \u2019 s article \u201c The Value of Islamic Law \u201d ( \u2018 \u0130SL\u00c2M HUKUKUNUN DE\u011eER\u0130 \u2019 ) gives some salient numbers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has increased fivefold in the period from 2010 to 2019 , going from 6,252 to 33,202 .\nWhile the overall number of theology faculties has also risen from 24 to 92 while the number of faculty members rose from 1,120 to 4,121 in the same nine-year period .\nG\u00f6zler states that at the moment a grand total of 407 individual Turkish academics are working at Islamic law and Fiqh ( F\u0131k\u0131h or Islamic jurisprudence ) departments in nationwide theology faculties .\nDr Kemal G\u00f6zler has thus written a clear warning that dangeous groundwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes far removed from the glare of public scrutiny .\nLast month , the prominent AKP member Cahit \u00d6zkan supported his leader in calling for a new constitution , saying that \u201c our intention with this renewed foundational constitution is a demand for the preparation of a new constitution with a broad participation , [ a new constitution ] that is endowed with a progressive spirit taking account of the knowledge of the past and that would renew our material and spiritual values that holding us together.\n\u201d In response , the investigative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c real target \u201d of this constitutional enterprise would seem to be the principle of secularism ( or as he put it , \u201c laiklik \u201d or laicism ) , which he sees as the glue \u201c holding 83 milllion together.\n\u201d Fara\u00e7 \u2019 s piece is significantly headlined as \u2018 Will First Laicism and then the Republic be Destroyed ?\n\u2019 The \u201c material and spiritual values \u201d alluded to by Cahit \u00d6zkan are but a not-so veiled way of saying Islam and Muslim beliefs and habits .\nLooking back at early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of a great variety of ethnic groups whose main common traits had been their Sunni Muslim identity , as I explained in 2008 : The subsequent successful War-of-Independence ( 1919-22 ) and formation of the Republic of Turkey ( 1923 ) by Mustafa Kemal and his followers led to a form of social engineering ( knows as Turkification ) that transformed the Anatolian Muslims into Anatolian Turks \u2013 \u201c the idea of the Anatolian population as a Turkish entity was first proposed as early as 1922 , the year prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in 1924 , the first Turkish constitution proclaimed that the \u2018 name Turk , as a political term , shall be understood to include all citizens of the Turkish Republic , without distinction of , or reference to , race or religion \u2019 , \u201d as I have argued in 2013 .\nIn fact , the Kemalist stress on \u201c Anatolia as the homeland of the Turks , \u201d led the Kemalist intelligentsia and educational establishment to present the \u201c pre-Islamic ancient civilisations of Anatolia .\n.\n.\nas the primordial Turks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winrow .\nAs a result , liberal as well as Islamist critics of Atat\u00fcrk \u2019 s reforms had long been arguing that Kemalism suppresses ethnic diversity , turning the multi-ethnic mosaic that is Anatolia into a supposedly mono-ethnic Turkish state and homeland .\nIn the late 20th century , an awareness of the Turkish population \u2019 s ethnic diversity became current again as a result of the originally American concept of identity politics .\nIn the early 21st century , \u201c the concept of identity politics is ubiquitous.\n\u201d These days , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnic identity .\nIn Turkey , an Islamist politician like Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has craftily exploited this sudden blooming of ethnic awareness in the land .\nAs long ago as 2005 , when he was Turkey \u2019 s Prime Minister , Erdo\u011fan first launched his verbal assault on the Kemalist policy of Turkification .\nAddressing a crowd in the eastern city of \u015eemdinli , he said that \u201c [ a ] Turk will say I am a Turk , a Kurd , I am a Kurd , a Laz , I am a Laz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bosnian .\nBut the upper identity that unites us all is [ our ] citizenship of the Republic of Turkey.\n\u201d At the time , the then-leader of the opposition CHP ( Republican People \u2019 s Party , founded on 9 September 1923 by Mustafa Kemal himself ) Deniz Baykal vehemently objected , saying that the expression the \u201c Turkish people \u201d can not be replaced by the phrase \u201c citizen of the Turkish Republic.\n\u201d Alas , Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s words had released the genie out of the bottle and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleven years later , the American journalist Sabrina Tavernise wrote in the New York Times that Erdo\u011fan was then busy \u201c sculpting \u201d a \u201c new Turkish identity.\n\u201d His words had given rise to a new concept , to the idea that a Turkish citizen possessed a lower ( ethnic ) identity and an upper ( civic ) identity as a Turkish citizen or Turk .\nThe unspoken message was that the religion of Sunni Islam provided the common ground uniting various Anatolian ethnic groups under the banner of Turkey , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Turkey founded by the new Atat\u00fcrk that is none other than Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan .\nThe New Turkey : Anatolian Federation of Muslim Ethnicities In May 2015 , the now-Prez went to \u201c the south-eastern city of \u015eanl\u0131urfa , a place with a mixed population consisting primarily of Kurds , Arabs and Turkmens .\nAddressing his audience directly , Erdo\u011fan expressed the wish that \u2018 [ o ] ur Lord would make our unity , our togetherness last forever.\n\u2019 This sentence appears very significant indeed .\n[ In early 2016 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headman ( known as muhtar , in Turkish ) in the capital Ankara , he elaborated on the phrase , \u2018 [ m ] ay our Lord make our unity , our togetherness last forever .\nWhat are we saying then ?\nWe will be one , [ we ] will be strong , we will be brothers , all together we will be Turkey \u2019 .\n\u201d In the space of ten years , the AKP leadership had succeeded in re-defining the concept of Turkish unity ( or Turkish citizenship , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a state of unity and togetherness that is grounded in a common faith , grounded in Sunni Islam .\nFor , as verbalized by the well-respected Atat\u00fcrk biographer Andrew Mango ( 1926-2014 ) in 1999 , Islamist and other critics of Mustafa Kemal \u2019 s experiment have always thought that the Kemalist \u201c policy of secularism divided Turkish society and severed the link between the rulers and the ruled.\n\u201c That a secularist ( and arguably irreligious ) elite ruled a pious people beholden to the tenets of the Prophet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNow , in the 21st century , the Prez and his AKP henchmen have initiated a process stressing that the political class in Ankara is not different from the regular citizenry living in each and every corner of Turkey , that the rulers and the ruled of Turkey are equally united in their pious dedication to Sunni Islam .\nArguably , this process will come to completion with a new constitution , a legal document that will once and for all banish the memories of Atat\u00fcrk \u2019 s legacy and Turkish Secularism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days ago , Erdo\u011fan has publicly said that \u201c [ f ] or years , the CHP [ denoting not just the opposition party but really encompassing each and every politician and/or individual in the mould of Atat\u00fcrk ] has abused some of our citizens by using principles such as Atat\u00fcrkism and modernity , \u201d indicating that the Kemalist consensus of old has all but turned Turkey \u2019 s pious masses into second-class citizens .\nTalking directly about the Kemalist elite of yesteryear , the Prez then said : \u201c They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d In this way , a proposed new Turkish constitution would predicate the New Turkey \u2019 s future on Anatolia \u2019 s pre-Republican past , undoing the effects of the past policies of Turkification and replacing the latter with a strict policy of Sunnification .\nThe CHP parliamentarian and member of the national assembly \u2019 s judicial committee , Rafet Zeybek ominously , yet arguably , quite correctly said that the \u201c aim of the government is not a democratic Turkey , but a theocratic republic based on the principles of religion.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matter Will the New Turkey now inexorably move towards becoming an Anatolian federation of Muslim ethnicities , possibly linked to a revived caliphate and ruled by Sharia Law ?\n!\n?\n?\nLate in 2011 , the godfather of Oriental studies Bernard Lewis ( 1916-2018 ) , who had a special interest in Turkey and who had never hidden his personal admiration for Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk , made the following bleak pronouncement : Dr. Lewis painted a dire picture , but the shift away from the Middle East has been noticeable ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia \u201d at the outset of the previous decade , which all but underlined that the 21st century is going to a Chinese century to the detriment of the hydrocarbon-rich Middle East and its American protector .\nAnd it seems , a number of Middle Eastern governments have also seen the writing on the wall .\nAs pointed out by Dr Aisha Al-Sarihi , saying that \u201c Gulf countries have begun to shift their attention toward renewables .\n.\n.\n[ s ] ince the 2014 drop in oil prices ; \u201d Adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2018 , the total renewable electricity installed capacity in the Gulf Arab states increased by almost 313 percent \u201d \u2013 listing such countries like Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates .\nIn contrast , the AKP-led New Turkey steadfastly keeps pursuing its hydrocarbon dreams of old , trying to become a regional and even global energy hub .\nSuccessive AKP governments have long been paying lip service to renewables but the reality is that Turkish government policy seems solely geared towards fossil fuels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , though , the economic situation in the New Turkey is quite dire , the Global Source Partners \u2018 country analyst for Turkey , Atilla Ye\u015filada quite openly speaks about the blatant economic mismanagement of the country by the AKP government and he does not shy away from laying the blame directly at the feet of none other than the Prez himself .\nThough his country \u2019 s economic woes do trouble Tayyip Erdo\u011fan , and his personal avarice seems quite plain to see , as a pious believer he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon territories forming the successor nation state to the multi-ethnic , poly-religious yet staunchly Islamic Ottoman State with \u2018 Pure Water for Thirsty Muslims , \u2019 to use the words of the Ottoman poet and bureaucrat Gelibolulu Mustafa Ali Efendi ( 1541-1600 ) .\n\u201d And the upcoming centenary in 2023 seems like an ideal moment and opportunity to do just that , to go \u2018 back to the future \u2019 .\n.\n.\nand I would like to end here by once again quoting the eminent Dr Lewis \u2019 s quite prescient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided yet .\nBasically their choice is to go back in the past or go into the future .\nThe Turks themselves will have to decide on

Cahill Warned of \u2018Tainted Jury Pool\u2019 Several Months Ago", "content": "Judge Cahill \u2019 s warning has gone largely unheeded .\nIs this case headed for a mistrial ?\nIMAGE : A masked Judge Peter Cahill presiding over the trial .\nFollow our LIVE trial coverage ( MINNEAPOLIS , MN ) \u2013 As jury selection in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin finishes its fourth day in the televised courtroom , viewers of this high-profile case are beginning to see just how politicized it has become .\nEven the trial \u2019 s presiding Judge Peter Cahill saw this coming \u2013 having warned public officials about it months ago .\nBack in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at a hearing for the officers charged in George Floyd \u2019 s death , which included Chauvin , Judge Cahill \u201c warned state prosecutors not to allow further public comment on the case before it goes to trial.\n\u201d Judge Cahill was specific in his admonishment at the time , telling Asst .\nAttorney General Matthew Frank , who is now part of the state \u2019 s prosecution team in the Chauvin case , that \u201c recent statements by Governor Tim Walz , Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arrrodondo , Floyd family attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury pool and could result in a gag order or change of venue.\n\u201d IMAGE : Attorney General Keith Ellison , pictured above standing up , though rarely seen on camera in the courtroom , leads the state \u2019 s prosecution team .\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison , the state \u2019 s top cop , pushed hard to get the third-degree murder charge re-instated .\nHe leads the prosecution \u2019 s case against Chauvin and also promised back in June of 2020 to \u2018 get justice \u2019 for George Floyd .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pool of potential jurors in this case have had ample opportunity to marinate in the media coverage , while very few media outlets question the motives behind everything from sweeping new police reform legislation to multimillion dollar civil suits .\nThe jury pool has now lived through almost a year of 24/7 media coverage of social justice movements all across America \u2013 for many , locked in their homes and \u2018 sequestered by COVID \u2019 \u2013 and George Floyd \u2019 s death remains a big part of this narrative .\nWith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act of 2020 \u201d passing the U.S. House of Representatives and now being considered by the Senate , media coverage of police reforms and how it \u2018 converges \u2019 with the events of the trial has already reached a fever pitch , including in this recent MSNBC report : \u201c How can we prevent the next George Floyd ?\nPrevent the next Derek Chauvin \u201d .\nAnd this just in from earlier today , another media impression for this unsequestered jury pool to process : Now , the city of Minneapolis has succumbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements and approved a \u2018 record-breaking \u2019 financial settlement with Floyd \u2019 s family .\nThe timing of such a civil suit judgment seems conspicuous and inverted , since these types of civil actions are typically resolved after the criminal trial .\nIt will be difficult for the media to avoid portraying the civil settlement \u2019 s \u2018 largest payment in history \u2019 as anything other than evidence of a victory for both George Floyd \u2019 s legacy and the state \u2019 s case against Chauvin \u2013 assuming guilt before the trial officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime type connotations .\nAre all the histrionics of this case to date just a prelude to the inevitable ?\nA mistrial ?\nIt appears that Judge Cahill \u2019 s warning from several months ago about the potential for a tainted jury pool in this case has gone largely unheeded .\nArradondo called Floyd \u2019 s death a murder for the first time in a statement last week , a characterization Walz made much earlier .\nCrump leaked the planned trial date of March 8 to local press last week .\nThat news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date Monday , with the caveat that if the four cases are not joined he would prioritize those of Derek Chauvin and Tou Thao , who are still in custody .\n\u201c From this day forward , everyone has had their warning , and if they don \u2019 t abide by the court \u2019 s instructions , it will be the court \u2019 s gag order , and possibly a change of venue , \u201d the judge said .\n\u201c The state has met its obligations , I think , with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they will advise those over whom they have influence , but not control.\n\u201d Cahill cited similar reasons when he denied the officers \u2019 motion to allow audio and video coverage inside the courtroom for pretrial proceedings on Friday .\nDefense attorneys Earl Gray , Thomas Plunkett , Eric Nelson and Robert Paule had requested that video coverage be allowed , arguing that in a case where public officials from the police chief to the governor had made statements decrying their clients , camera access to courtrooms could help them present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are involved in the investigation , in the prosecution , and they \u2019 ve been making public comments , \u201d said Paule , who represents Thao .\n\u201c My client has a constitutional right to a fair trial , but there are also ethical considerations here.\n\u201d *** Visit our LIVE Blog coverage or follow us for trial updates @ 21stCenturyWire on Twitter .\nIf you like our trial coverage

continue to mount internationally , officials in the United States have been working behind the scenes to try and censor any dissent against the official party line on COVID policy , and vaccine efficacy , safety and distribution .\nA recent Reuters report has revealed how a worried Biden administration has reached out to Silicon Valley \u2019 s digital monopoly firms Google Inc , Facebook , and Twitter \u2013 to coordinate effort to shut down any discussions or independent journalism online which might challenge the credibility of either government or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vaccine policies , as well crush any serious challenge to the credibility of pharmaceutical firms and the products they are pushing , namely their new experimental range of COVID vaccines .\nAccording to a White House official , the new effort is meant to curb supposed \u201c COVID misinformation \u201d included making sure Google , YouTube , Facebook and Twitter prevented any independent content from going viral .\nA Twitter spokesman admitted that the firm was coordinating their censorship operation with the Biden team , and were \u201c in regular communication with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical issues including COVID-19 misinformation.\n\u201d According to a report by Reuters , a source confirmed the collusion between the White House and Big Tech is focused on protecting Biden \u2019 s vaccine numbers : \u201c Disinformation that causes vaccine hesitancy is going to be a huge obstacle to getting everyone vaccinated and there are no larger players in that than the social media platforms , \u201d \u201c We are talking to them \u2026 so they understand the importance of misinformation and disinformation and how they can get rid of it quickly.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies \u201c were receptive \u201d as they engaged with the White House .\n\u201c But it is too soon to say whether or not it translates into lessening the spread of misinformation.\n\u201d The mainstream media have been applying continuous pressure on Facebook and Instagram for allowing \u201c anti-vaxxer propaganda \u201d , with Facebook responding by applying its notorious \u2018 fact-check \u2019 labels and other censorship measures .\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. from Childrens Health Defense recently explained how this coordinated censorship effort is also targeting high-profile advocates , including himself : Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other social media sites have deplatformed me and many other critics of regulatory corruption and authoritarian public health policies .\nSo , here is some fodder for those of you who have the eerie sense that the government/industry pandemic response feels like it was planned \u2014 even before there was a pandemic .\nIn fact , a simulation called Event 201 , which involved top public health officials , academics and NGOs was in fact paid for by Bill and Melinda Gates , taking place only a few months before the \u2018 global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nKennedy describes the confab which took place in late October 2019 at Johns Hopkins University in Washington DC : Gates \u2019 co-conspirators included representatives from the World Bank , the World Economic Forum ( Great Reset ) , Bloomberg/Johns Hopkins University Populations Center , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , various media powerhouses , the Chinese government , a former Central Intelligence Agency/National Security Agency director ( there is no such thing as a former CIA officer ) , vaccine maker Johnson & Johnson , the finance and biosecurity industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading corporate PR firm .\nAt Gates \u2019 direction , these eminences role-played members of a Pandemic Control Council , wargaming government strategies for controlling the pandemic , the narrative and the population .\nNeedless to say , there was little talk of building immune systems , off-the-shelf remedies or off-patent therapeutic drugs and vitamins , but lots of chatter about promoting uptake of new patentable antiviral drugs and vaccines .\nBut the participants primarily focused on planning industry-centric , fear-mongering , police-state strategies for managing an imaginary global coronavirus contagion culminating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real danger here is the Government and Big Tech may in fact be censoring important critical voices of what are fast proving to be highly problematic experimental vaccines .\nIn doing so , they may be preventing important public health opinion and commentary from being heard , which raises the likelihood that any rank corruption like with the WHO \u2019 s Swine Flu hoax in 2009 , or the Swine Flu vaccine disaster in 1976 \u2013 may happen again , only this time on a global scale .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR WINTER @ @ @", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

follow-up video interview , Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche , says that by vaccinating everyone with a vaccine that doesn \u2019 t prevent transmission , we are destroying people \u2019 s immune systems , and setting the stage for a global health disaster .\nGeert Vanden Bossche , DMV , Ph.D. , has nothing against vaccines .\nIn fact , the independent virologist formerly worked for Gavi , The Vaccine Alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .\nBossche says the COVID vaccines approved so far have been developed by \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no criticism of them But , as he tells Dr. Phillip McMillan in an interview , \u201c please use the right vaccine at the right place .\nAnd don \u2019 t use it in the heat of a pandemic on millions of millions of people.\n\u201d Bossche says that a mass vaccination campaign in the middle of a pandemic , with vaccines that don \u2019 t prevent transmission , is disastrous at an individual \u2014 and at a global \u2014 level : \u201c We are going to pay a huge price for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I \u2019 m thinking of my children , of the younger generation .\nI mean , it \u2019 s just impossible what we are doing .\nWe don \u2019 t understand the pandemic.\n\u201d In an open letter to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , Bossche wrote that \u201c we are currently turning vaccinees into asymptomatic carriers shedding infectious variants.\n\u201d Bossche hasn \u2019 t heard back from WHO , which concerns him .\n\u201c It is about humanity \u2026 I mean , it \u2019 s about your children .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s my family .\nIt \u2019 s everyone .\nRight .\nAnd it \u2019 s simply for me , I put everything at stake because I \u2019 ve done my homework .\nAnd this is simply a moral obligation .\nA moral obligation.\n\u201d Watch : McMillan : I think the first thing that we have to clarify is that we have to explain you are someone who is in the vaccine development business , so to speak .\nWhat has that background been like ?\nBossche : Well , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as vaccines are concerned , in industry as well as in the non-for-profit sector .\nSo I have been working with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , GAVI [ The Vaccine Alliance ] especially concentrating on vaccines for global health .\nAnd I \u2019 ve also been working with several different companies , vaccine companies developing of course essentially prophylactic vaccines and my main focus of interest has always been , in fact , the design of vaccines .\nSo the concept , how can we educate the immune system in ways that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do right now with our conventional vaccines .\nMcMillan : Right .\nAnd so any effect , this is the area of work you \u2019 ve been in .\nYou develop vaccines , you are as well working with the Ebola vaccine as well .\nOne of the really , really dangerous viruses we have out there in the world .\nHow does that work ?\nIs it , is that easy to do ?\nBossche : Well , I was not , let me be very clear .\nI was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo we were interacting with several different vaccine companies that were developing Ebola vaccines , because it was important for GAVI to make the right choice , the right vaccine in order for this vaccine to be rolled out in the Western African countries that had this severe Ebola crisis back a number of years ago .\nSo that was not a , let \u2019 s say operational practical work .\nThis was more a role of coordination , but of course was also a role of assessing what would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in larger populations and in an area where an epidemic really is going on because that \u2019 s a very particular and peculiar situation .\nMcMillan : Yes .\nAnd so in effect , we \u2019 ve had so much success over the past hundred years with some very big breakthroughs with vaccines , smallpox , you know , measles , mumps , rubella , polio .\nBut we have struggled with other vaccines .\nWithout going into the details , because this is very difficult to get across , but is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some easier to get a vaccine for ?\nBossche : Well , I think we have a , Philip .\nEssentially , we need to distinguish , of course , between what we call acute self-limiting diseases .\nThese are diseases that naturally come to an end in a sense that ultimately the individual will eliminate the pathogen .\nOf course , some people may die .\nOf course , let \u2019 s be very clear .\nThose who survive will ultimately eliminate the pathogen .\nThat is the vast majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far .\nThe , you know , I don \u2019 t need to tell you that with other viruses where we clearly see that they spread in a completely different way .\nThey spread , for example , from cell to cell , they tend to be more intracellular .\nThey tend to develop chronic infections where it \u2019 s not self-limiting , it \u2019 s not acute self-limiting , it \u2019 s chronic .\nIt is much more difficult .\nAnd the reason primarily is that most of the vaccines we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need these antibodies in the blood , or we need these antibodies to translate to the mucosa , for example , in order to capture the pathogen and to neutralize it .\nSo some of the other work , I mean , they have a very insidious strategy in the sense that they hide in cells , that they can already at the mucosal barrier penetrate , you know , immediately into cells .\nAnd then the cells may migrate , for example , to the lymph nodes .\nSo they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it very , very difficult because we know that we can catch them to some extent in the blood , but what they do all the time is that they insert mutation and they escape , they fully escape to our antibody responses .\nSo that makes it way more difficult .\nIt \u2019 s also the reason why also against cancer , et cetera , we have not been extremely successful with vaccines as I would say , stand alone therapy .\nMcMillan : Yeah , absolutely .\nYes .\nSo it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are with regards to COVID-19 .\nNow , if we have 20/20 vision at the moment , when we look back at the pandemic and where we started from , and I \u2019 ve always said that at the time , when the pandemic started , when it got from China and Italy into Europe , into the UK .\nI thought that the only way that we could manage this is to lock down and to prevent the spread of this apparently , this very dangerous virus .\nWe do have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not those decisions were correct .\nBut as we said , that hindsight is 20/20 .\nWhat would you say now , as we look back at the decisions we made then , were we about on the right track ?\nDid we make any mistakes ?\nBossche : Well , frankly speaking , from the very beginning , and I mean , there are many people who can witness this or testify this .\nI always said that it was a bad idea to do lockdowns that would also affect the younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people from having contact , from being exposed .\nBecause remember , the big difference back then was , of course , that we had a viral strain , COVID strain , that was circulating , dominant strain , and that was not as highly infectious as those that we are seeing right now .\nOf course , when a new virus gets into a population , it immediately gets to the folks that have , you know , weak immunity .\nAnd we know , we know these people , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elderly people , people that have underlying diseases or are otherwise immune suppressed , et cetera .\nAnd of course , I mean , it was certainly the right thing to do , to protect these people , and for them also to isolate , but we have to distinguish , frankly speaking , and that is what we have not been doing , between those people that have strong innate immunity .\nI mean , it \u2019 s not a , you can not see when you see a person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we know that young people have quite decent innate immune response and therefore they are naturally protected and even more , I mean , if they get in contact with coronavirus , it will boost their natural immunity .\nSo therefore from the very beginning , I disapproved , you know , the fact that schools got to close and universities and that youngsters were prevented even from having contact with each other .\nThat situation is of course completely different .\nIf you look at vulnerable people , the virus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no , you know , humoral immunity .\nThere is no immunity at all .\nIn fact , so nobody has been in contact .\nSo the youngsters , they can rely on good innate immunity .\nElderly people , I mean , the innate immunity is waning .\nIt gets increasingly replaced by antigen-specific , by specific immunity as people get older .\nSo these people very , very clearly needed to be protected , but it has taken a lot of time before we understood , in fact , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were interacting .\nSo there \u2019 s been a lot of confusion .\nA lot of mistakes made .\nMistakes , I mean , retrospectively .\nAnd that has also led to , you know , bad control right from the beginning .\nI would say .\nMcMillan : With that in mind and where we are now , as countries across the world have been drifting towards the Christmas period , there \u2019 s still a rise in cases .\nCountries had to try and lock down , mask mandates and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that vaccines would come and break the cycle .\nThis is where clearly now from your expertise , you seem to have a different thought about how we should have been thinking about vaccines then , and even now , what is your perspective ?\nBossche : Well , my perspective was , and still is , that if you go to war , you better make sure that you have the right weapon and the weapon in itself can be an excellent weapon .\nAnd that is what I \u2019 m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , just brilliant people who have been making these vaccines in no time and with regulatory approval and everything .\nSo the weapon in itself is excellent .\nQuestion is , is this the right weapon for the kind of war that is going on right now ?\nAnd there my answer is definitely no , because these are prophylactic vaccines and prophylactic vaccines should typically not be administered to people who are exposed to high infectious pressure .\nSo don \u2019 t forget we are administering these vaccines in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words while we are preparing our weapon , we are fully attacked by the virus .\nThe virus is everywhere .\nSo that is a very different scenario from using such vaccines in a setting where the vaccine is barely or not exposed to the virus .\nAnd I \u2019 m saying this , because if you have a high infectious pressure , it \u2019 s so easy for the virus to jump from one person to the other .\nSo if your immune response , however , is just mounting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of people who get their first dose , they get the first dose , the antibodies are not fully mature , the titers are maybe not very high .\nSo their immune response is suboptimal , but they are in the midst of this war while they are mounting an immune response , they \u2019 re fully attacked by the virus and every single time .\nI mean , this is textbook knowledge .\nEvery single time you have an immune response that is suboptimal in the presence of an infection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that infected person , you are at risk for immune escape .\nSo that means that the virus can escape the immune response .\nAnd that is why I \u2019 m saying that these vaccines , I mean , in their own right , are , of course , excellent .\nBut to use them in the midst of a pandemic and do mass vaccination , because then you provide within a very short period of time , the population with high antibody titers \u2013 so the virus comes under enormous pressure .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter if you can eradicate a virus , if you can prevent infection , but these vaccines don \u2019 t prevent infection .\nThey protect against disease because we are just , unfortunately , we look no further than the end of our nose in the sense that hospitalization , that \u2019 s all what counts , you know , getting people away from the hospital .\nBut in the meantime , we are not realizing that we give all the time during this pandemic , by our interventions , the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system .\nAnd that is of course , a very , very , very dangerous thing .\nEspecially , if we realize that these guys , they only need 10 hours to replicate .\nSo if you think that by making new vaccines , a new vaccine against the new infectious strains , we going to catch up , it \u2019 s impossible to catch up .\nI mean , virus is not going to wait until we have those vaccines ready .\nI mean , this thing continues .\nAnd as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean , if you do this in the midst of a pandemic , that is an enormous problem .\nThese vaccines are excellent , but they are not made for administration to millions of people in the midst , in the heat of a pandemic .\nSo that is my thoughts .\nMcMillan : Is this equivalent then , because you \u2019 ve mentioned this in your paper , is this equivalent to using either a partial dose of antibiotics in anti-microbial or in a bacterial infection where you then produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of example that you \u2019 re alluding to ?\nBossche : Well , that is a very good parallel .\nIt \u2019 s also the parallel I \u2019 m using actually in the paper .\nWe just post it on LinkedIn [ bad choice , LinkedIn has been deplatforming and censoring scientists and doctors more than any other platform ] which , you know , should be so open for everybody [ wrong , they outsource to low paid \u201c fact checkers \u201d who aggressively censor according to left media news narratives ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure science because as you were pointing out , the thing is the rule is it \u2019 s very simple .\nI mean , same with antibiotics .\nEither the antibiotics do not match very well with the bug .\nThat \u2019 s not good .\nThat \u2019 s why we are making antibiograms , you know , to first identify which is the germ .\nAnd then we choose the antibiotics .\nWe need to have a very good match .\nOtherwise there could be resistance .\nSo when I compare this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good match with our antibodies ?\nNo , at this point in time , we don \u2019 t have a good match anymore because we have this kind of like almost heterologous variants .\nSo that differs from the original strain .\nSo the match isn \u2019 t very good anymore .\nAnd hence we see people are still protected , but they are already shedding the virus .\nSo that is one thing .\nThe other thing is the quantity , of course .\nYou tell people , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prescription , please don \u2019 t as soon as you feel well , that doesn \u2019 t mean that you can stop the antibiotics .\nSame here .\nAnd I get just one example .\nIf you give people just like one dose , I mean , they are in the process of mounting their antibodies .\nThe antibodies still need to fully mature , et cetera .\nSo this is a suboptimal situation .\nWe are putting them in a suboptimal situation with regard to their immune protection .\nAnd on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of the war .\nThey are fully attacked by all , you know , by all these kinds of a highly infectious variants .\nSo , I mean , it \u2019 s very clear that this is driving immune escape and will ultimately drive resistance to the vaccines .\nSo my point is , yes , Philip , it \u2019 s very similar .\nThere is one difference .\nThe virus needs living cells .\nI mean , if you \u2019 re driving immune escape , but the guy has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cares ?\nThis situation is now different because we are in the midst of a war , there is a high infectious pressure .\nSo the likelihood that an immune escape immediately finds another living cell , that means another host is very , very high .\nIt \u2019 s per definition .\nIt \u2019 s the definition almost of a pandemic .\nMcMillan : So it raises a simple question that somebody has put in front of us here , which is , it \u2019 s perfectly common sense .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is very easy .\nI mean , we need to do a better job when we are confronted with situations that seem very dramatic .\nLike , you know , an epidemic .\nOur generation has not , you know , been living in times where there are epidemics or pandemics .\nAnd so we immediately take action and jump on the beast with the tools we have instead of analyzing what is really going on .\nAnd one thing that I thought was extremely interesting was , and it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know that the number of people or asymptomatically infected , so they are infected , but they don \u2019 t develop severe symptoms .\nOf course they can have some mild symptoms of respiratory disease , whatever .\nSo the question is what exactly happens with those folks that they can eliminate the virus , they eliminate the virus , they don \u2019 t transmit it .\nThey will shed it for like a week or so .\nAnd then they eliminate this , or you could say , yeah , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , wait a minute .\nThe antibodies come later , you have first the search of , you know , shedding of the virus .\nAnd it \u2019 s only afterwards that you see , you know , a moderate and short-lived raise of antibodies .\nSo the antibodies can not be responsible for elimination of the virus .\nSo what is responsible for elimination of the virus ?\nLuckily enough , we have a number of brilliant scientists , independent , brilliant scientists that have now increasingly been showing .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is happening is that NK cells are taking care of virus .\nSo NK cells that the virus gets into , into these epithelial cells and starts to replicate , but NK cells get activated and they will kill , they will kill the cell , you know , in which the virus tries to replicate .\nSo I was saying that the virus needs to rely on a living cell .\nSo you kill that cell .\nIt \u2019 s gone , it \u2019 s all over .\nSo we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people eliminate it .\nMcMillan : Absolutely .\nI just wanted to clarify , because when you said NK cells , somebody may not quite know what you mean .\nSo you mean non killer cells .\nSo it \u2019 s a specific group of \u2026 McMillan : Sorry .\nIt \u2019 s natural killer cells , a special group of white blood cells that go and take out the viral infected cell .\nSo , yes , you \u2019 re right .\nBecause I have seen from a clinical perspective , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overwhelmed by the virus and they have a few symptoms and then they \u2019 re okay .\nSo they , the body does manage to get rid of it in some cases .\nAnd so it raises the point that I \u2019 ve always been saying is that we haven \u2019 t spent enough time understanding how the virus impacts the body and understanding how the pandemic then will impact the world .\nWe \u2019 ve spent all of our time just going for solutions .\nHas that been a mistake ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the , you know , the most important mistake , I think .\nI \u2019 m not sure many people and I , I was part of them .\nSo in all modesty , I was part of them .\nNot sure whether many people understand how a natural pandemic develops and why we have this first wave .\nWe have the second wave .\nAnd we have this third wave .\nAnd , I mean , these waves of disease and mortality and morbidity , they shift from one population to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , the second wave , this was typically also the case with influenza , World War I , when basically more soldiers , young people died in the trenches of influenza than from from injuries or whatever .\nSo firstly , elderly , I mean , weak immune system , et cetera .\nThen it gets to the wave of morbidity and mortality to the younger people .\nAnd then it gets back to people who have antibodies .\nSo we have to understand this first , Oh , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden does this wave of morbidity and mortality shift , for example , why are the three waves ?\nHow do we explain this ?\nAnd also , how does it come that some people are naturally protected and others are not ?\nWhat are these mechanisms , what are these molecular mechanisms ?\nBecause if you make vaccines and all these things , at the end of the day , this is going to interact at the molecular level .\nAnd we have not been understanding this .\nI would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand our weapon because we don \u2019 t understand that prophylactic vaccines should not be used in the midst of an epidemic .\nAnd we don \u2019 t understand exactly what the virus is , do we .\nSo we go to a war and we don \u2019 t know our enemy .\nWe don \u2019 t understand the strategy of our enemy .\nAnd we don \u2019 t know how our weapon works .\nI mean , how is that going to go ?\nWe have a fundamental problem to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I completely accept that , but at the same time , I am still thinking that if the governments don \u2019 t respond in some way , because they have to be seen to be doing something .\nThey seem to be in a lose-lose situation .\nIf they don \u2019 t do anything , they \u2019 re going to be criticized .\nAnd if they do do something , they \u2019 re going to be criticized .\nIs that a fair statement to make ?\nBossche : I don \u2019 t think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , what \u2019 s the name of the guy ?\nHippocrates .\nYou know the rule ?\nMcMillan : The first .\nDo no harm .\nBossche : Okay .\nWell , I mean , it wouldn \u2019 t matter if you start vaccinating people and even if it doesn \u2019 t work .\nProblem is that we induce a long lived antibody response .\nAnd as a matter of fact , we know , I mean , that is not my knowledge .\nIt \u2019 s all published .\nProblem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the puzzle together .\nFact is that these long lived antibodies , which have high specificity , of course , for the virus .\nThey out-compete our natural antibodies because they \u2019 re natural antibodies , they have a very broad spectrum , but they have low affinity .\nRight ?\nAnd so by doing this , even if your antibodies don \u2019 t work anymore , because there is resistance or , you know , that the strains are too different from the original strain , we still , these antibodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-compete your natural antibodies .\nAnd that is a huge problem because I was saying just a few minutes ago , these natural antibodies , they provide you with broad protection .\nThis protection is , yes , it is variant nonspecific .\nDoesn \u2019 t matter what variant you get .\nIt doesn \u2019 t even matter what type of coronavirus is coming in .\nThey will protect you .\nUnless , of course , you suppress this level of innate immunity , or it is , for example , out-competed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s not like , okay , you know , you missed it .\nOkay , let \u2019 s try again .\nNo , you did some harm .\nI mean , this is different from drugs .\nImmunizing somebody is installing a new software on your computer .\nDon \u2019 t forget .\nI mean , these antibodies , they will be recalled every single time you \u2019 re encountering a coronavirus , right ?\nI mean , you can not just erase this .\nSo this is very serious .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ So this is an important point because when I was looking at some of the research around the challenges that they faced with the initial SARS , called the first epidemic , and they tried to develop the vaccines .\nOne of the things they found , certainly when they tested it on the ferrets , was that when they expose them to a coronavirus again , they got a very severe response to it .\nIs this what you \u2019 re saying ?\nThat we \u2019 re putting ourselves in a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe disease even to viruses that should normally be quite benign ?\nBossche : Well , you know , you see all my passion and my conviction , but I mean , I \u2019 ve been the last to criticize the vaccines in terms of , would they , in some regard , could they , in some regard be unsafe because , you know , you would have even this exacerbation of disease due to antibodies that doesn \u2019 t match very well with the coronavirus they \u2019 re exposed to et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this , and there is a lot of serious thoughts about this .\nBut I think what we are talking about right now , the epidemic or the pandemic problem of having a population that is at no point during the pandemic and to large extent , due to our intervention , has not a strong immune response .\nI mean , this is already serious enough .\nThis is more concerning than one or the other adverse events that could maybe elicited , I \u2019 m not downplaying it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have antibodies that do no longer match very well with the strain they were or with the strain they are exposed to .\nAnd therefore , you know , they build a complex , they don \u2019 t neutralize the virus , they build a complex and this complex could maybe even enhance viral entry into susceptible cells and hence lead to exacerbation of disease .\nI mean , this may be possible , but the problem I \u2019 m talking about is a global problem .\nIt \u2019 s not an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a global problem of , you know , making this virus increasingly infectious because we live it all the time , a chance and opportunity to escape an immune system and to drive this .\nSo to wake this up , you know , up to a level where the virus is so infectious , that we can even no longer control it , because I mean , these highly infectious strains , some people think , Oh , the virus is going to calm down and it will insert a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be gentle and kind with us .\nThat \u2019 s not going to happen .\nI mean , this highly infectious range remains .\nIt is not going to be spontaneous mutations that all of a sudden would become , would make this virus again harmless because such a virus would have a competitive disadvantage , could not be dominant anymore , so that \u2019 s not going to happen .\nSo we \u2019 re talking about a very , very , very serious problem here .\nMcMillan : So I \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite frankly , I get asked the questions .\nWe \u2019 re coming to a point where people are going to have to take these vaccines .\nThat looks as though it \u2019 s the reality .\nEither in the context of work or in the context of travel .\nBased on what you \u2019 re saying , they \u2019 re in a lose-lose situation .\nWhat does this mean ?\nBossche : Well , what does this mean ?\nIt \u2019 s very clear .\nIt \u2019 s very clear what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s consider the consequences of this both at a population level and at an individual level , because I would well understand if for the population is maybe not the best thing to do , but you know , on an individual level , it \u2019 s still okay .\nYeah .\nThen it \u2019 s not an easy , that \u2019 s not an easy question .\nBut as a matter of fact , it \u2019 s exactly the opposite .\nWell , it \u2019 s not the opposite .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as on an individual level .\nAnd I \u2019 m telling you why .\nI think the population level I explained to you , we are increasingly facing highly infectious strains that already right now , we can not control because basically what we are doing is that we are turning \u2014 when we vaccinate somebody , we are turning this person in a potential asymptomatic carrier that is shedding the virus .\nBut at an individual level , I just told you that if you have these antibodies and at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , people can challenge me on this , but , you know , reality will prove it .\nBossche : I think we are very close to vaccine resistance right now .\nAnd it \u2019 s not for nothing that already people start developing , you know , new vaccines against the strains , et cetera .\nBut what I was saying is that , okay , if you miss the shoot , okay , you could say nothing has happened .\nNo .\nYou are at the same time losing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you could ever imagine .\nAnd that is your innate immune system , because the innate antibodies , the natural antibodies , the secretary IGMs will be out-competed by these antigen-specific antibodies for binding to the virus .\nAnd that will be long lived .\nThat is a long lived suppression .\nAnd you lose every protection against any viral variant or coronavirus variant , et cetera .\nSo this means that you are left just with no single immune response with your , you know , it \u2019 s none , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s all gone .\nThe antibodies don \u2019 t work anymore .\nAnd your your innate immunity has been completely bypassed and this while highly infectious strains are circulating .\nSo , I mean , if that isn \u2019 t clear enough , I really don \u2019 t get it .\nAnd people please do read my , you know , what I posted because it \u2019 s science , it \u2019 s pure science , pure science .\nAnd as everybody knows , I \u2019 m a highly passionate vaccine guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no criticism on the vaccines , but please use the right vaccine at the right place .\nAnd don \u2019 t use it in the heat of a pandemic on millions of millions of people .\nWe are going to pay a huge price for this .\nAnd I \u2019 m becoming emotional because I \u2019 m thinking of my children , of the younger generation .\nI mean , it \u2019 s just impossible what we are doing .\nWe don \u2019 t understand the pandemic .\nWe have been turning it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain where all of a sudden , all these highly infectious strains come from ?\nNobody can explain this .\nI can explain it .\nBut we have not been seeing this during previous pandemics , during natural pandemics .\nWe have not been seeing it .\nBecause at every single time , the immunity was low enough so that the virus didn \u2019 t need to escape .\nSo back at the end of the pandemic , when things calmed down and it was herd immunity , it was still the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing is that we are really chasing this virus and it becomes all , you know , increasingly infectious .\nAnd I mean , this is just a situation that is completely , completely completely out of control .\nSo it \u2019 s also , we are now getting plenty of asymptomatic shedders .\nPeople who shed the virus because if they are vaccinated or they have even antibodies from previous disease , they can no longer control these highly infectious variants .\nSo how does that come ?\nDoes anybody still understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top scientists looking at this curve , at its waves .\nLike somebody else is looking at the currency rates at the stock market .\nAll they can say is , Oh , it goes up , it \u2019 s stabilizing .\nIt may go down , may go up , et cetera .\nI mean , that is not science .\nThey don \u2019 t have any clue .\nThey don \u2019 t even know whether the curve is gon na go up exponentially or whether it \u2019 s gon na go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely lost .\nAnd that is extremely scary .\nThat has been the point where I said , okay , guy , you have to analyze .\nYou have to , but you know , these people are not listening .\nThat is the problem .\nMcMillan : So you are , in effect , putting your reputation on the line because you feel so passionately about this because I guarantee you that no government , no health system is going to want to hear what you are saying .\nYou are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire for an anti-vaxxer who doesn \u2019 t want the vaccine .\nBossche : No , no , well , no .\nBecause I \u2019 ve clearly also addressed some emails from anti-vaxxers .\nI mean , I \u2019 m not interested , but I \u2019 m clearly telling them that at this point , it \u2019 s so irrelevant , you know , whether you \u2019 re a pro vaxxer or an anti-vaxxer , et cetera , it is about the science .\nIt \u2019 s about humanity , right ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose our time now with criticizing people or , I mean , anti-vaxxer , okay .\nIf you \u2019 re not an anti-vaxxer , you could be a stalker .\nYou could be , you know , we like to stigmatize because if you stigmatize people , you don \u2019 t need to bother about them anymore .\nOh , this guy \u2019 s an anti-vaxxer .\nOkay .\nI mean , he \u2019 s out of the scope .\nOh , he \u2019 s a stalker .\nHe \u2019 s out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a discussion that is completely irrelevant at this point .\nIt is about humanity .\nAnd of course I \u2019 m passionate .\nOf course , I mean , it \u2019 s about your children .\nIt \u2019 s your family .\nIt \u2019 s my family .\nIt \u2019 s everyone .\nRight .\nAnd it \u2019 s simply for me , I put everything at stake because I \u2019 ve done my homework .\nAnd this is simply a moral obligation .\nA moral obligation .\nMcMillan : Wow .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s very little one can say , as I said , when you position that you are in the business of developing vaccines and helping societies protect against infections through the use of vaccines , and in this circumstance , you are saying , hold it , we \u2019 re doing the wrong thing here .\nIt \u2019 s very difficult to not listen to that .\nThat \u2019 s the truth .\nBossche : Well , the answer is very easy .\nI mean , this is human behavior .\nIf you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic , we do something and we try to make ourselves believe that it is the right thing to do , until there is complete chaos and there is a complete disaster .\nAnd then people say , well , you know , I mean , politicians will probably say , you know , we have been advised by the scientists and scientists , you know , will maybe point to somebody else , but this is now a situation .\nI \u2019 m asking every single scientist to scrutinize , to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the science and to study exactly the , I call these the immune pathogenesis of the disease .\nAnd because I like people to do their homework .\nAnd if the science is wrong , you know , if I \u2019 m proven wrong , I will admit it , but I can tell you , I \u2019 m not putting my career , my reputation at stake .\nI would not do this when I would not be 200 % convinced .\nAnd it \u2019 s not about me , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s about humanity .\nPeople don \u2019 t understand what is currently going on .\nAnd we have an obligation to explain this .\nAnd I posted my paper on LinkedIn and I invite all independent scientists please to look at it because this can be easily understood by microbiologists , immunologists , geneticists , you know , plenty of biochemists , etc.\n, etc.\n, all the biologists , all these people who have elementary knowledge , it \u2019 s not rocket science , elementary knowledge of biology should be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can only appeal to these people , you know , to stand up as independent scientists and to voice their opinion .\nMcMillan : Yes , yes , yes .\nI mean , that was a long point that somebody put on about the innate immune response , the false overreacting of the innate immune response , leading to detrimental effects in other coronaviruses .\nSo I think you \u2019 ve expressed this so well , Geert .\nI think that just hearing your explanation , the passion , the focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s as much as you can do .\nI think that I don \u2019 t even want to say any more because I don \u2019 t want to lose that passion that you have just expressed .\nHow much you are doing in terms of trying to see if you can make a difference with regards to the impact that we are having in this pandemic .\nYou know , we really , really appreciate that , Geert .\nWe really , really appreciate that .\nI hope enough people share this @ @ @ @ @ @

.\nThat \u2019 s the best that we can do at this point .\nWonderful .\nJust stay on the line there .\nWe \u2019 re just going to close off now , Geert .\nSo thank you again very , very much , Geert

group around the Davos World Economic Forum\u2013 the so-called Great Reset or UN Agenda 2030\u2013 is no future proposal .\nIt is well into actualization as the world remains in insane lockdown for a virus .\nThe hottest investment area since onset of the coronavirus global lockdowns is something called ESG investing .\nThis highly subjective and very controlled game is dramatically shifting global capital flows into a select group of \u201c approved \u201d corporate stocks and bonds .\nNotably it advances the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Reset agenda .\nThe development is one of the most dangerous and least understood shifts in at least the past century .\nThe UN \u201c sustainable economy \u201d agenda is being realized quietly by the very same global banks which have created the financial crises in 2008 .\nThis time they are preparing the Klaus Schwab WEF Great Reset by steering hundreds of billions and soon trillions in investment to their hand-picked \u201c woke \u201d companies , and away from the \u201c not woke \u201d such as oil and gas companies or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment funds like BlackRock have done is to create a new investment infrastructure that picks \u201c winners \u201d or \u201c losers \u201d for investment according to how serious that company is about ESG\u2014Environment , Social values and Governance .\nFor example a company gets positive ratings for the seriousness of its hiring gender diverse management and employees , or takes measures to eliminate their carbon \u201c footprint \u201d by making their energy sources green or sustainable to use the UN term .\nHow corporations contribute to a global sustainable governance is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include anything from corporate donations to Black Lives Matter to supporting UN agencies such as WHO .\nThe crucial central goal of ESG strategists is to create a shift to inefficient and costly alternative energy , the Zero Carbon promised utopia .\nIt is being driven by the world \u2019 s major financial institutions and central banks .\nThey have created a dazzling array of organizations to drive their green investing agenda .\nIn 2013 , well before the coronavirus , the major Wall Street bank , Morgan Stanley , created its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon expanded in 2015 when Morgan Stanley joined the Steering Committee of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials ( PCAF ) .\nOn its website the they state , \u201c PCAF is based upon the Paris Climate Agreement \u2019 s position that the global community should strive to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and that society should decarbonize and reach net zero emissions by 2050.\n\u201d By 2020 the PCAF had more than 100 banks and financial institutions including ABN Amro , Nat West , Lloyds Bank , Barclays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIBC , Danske Bank and others .\nSeveral of the PCAF member banks have been indicted in money laundering cases .\nNow they sense a new role as virtue-models to change the world economy , if we are to believe the rhetoric .\nNotably , former Bank of England Governor , Mark Carney is an \u201c Observer \u201d or consultant to the PCAF .\nIn August 2020 the PCAF published a draft standard outlining a proposed approach for global carbon accounting .\nThis means the bankers are creating their own accounting rules for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s carbon footprint or green profile .\nMark Carney is at the center of reorganizing world finance to back the UN 2030 green agenda behind the WEF Davos Great Reset , where he is a member of the Board of Trustees .\nHe also is Adviser to the UN Secretary General as United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Action .\nHe has described the PCAF plan as follows : \u201c To achieve net zero we need a whole economy transition \u2013 every company , every bank , every insurer and investor will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop credible plans for the transition and implement them .\nFor financial firms , that means reviewing more than the emissions generated by their own business activity .\nThey must measure and report the emissions generated by the companies they invest in and lend to .\nPCAF \u2019 s work to standardise the approach to measuring financed emissions is an important step to ensuring that every financial decision takes climate change into account.\n\u201d As Governor of the Bank of England Carney [ pictured above ] played a key role getting world central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UN 2030 scheme .\nThe major central banks of the world , through their umbrella Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) in Basle , created a key part of the growing global infrastructure that is steering investment flows to \u201c sustainable \u201d companies and away from those like oil and gas companies it deems \u201c unsustainable.\n\u201d When then-Bank of England Governor Mark Carney was head of the BIS \u2019 Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) he established something called Task-force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure ( TCFD ) in 2015 .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to form the TCFD .\nChaired by billionaire Michael Bloomberg , it included in addition to BlackRock , JP MorganChase ; Barclays Bank ; HSBC ; Swiss Re , the world \u2019 s second largest reinsurance ; China \u2019 s ICBC bank ; Tata Steel , ENI oil , Dow Chemical , mining giant BHP and David Blood of Al Gore \u2019 s Generation Investment LLC .\nAnne Finucane , the Vice Chair of the Bank of America , a member of both the PCAF and the TCFD , noted , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks and opportunities are properly managed within our business and that we are working with governments and markets to accelerate the changes required\u2026 climate change presents risks to the business community , and it is important for companies to articulate how these risks are being managed.\n\u201d The Bank of America vice chair describes how they assess risks in its real estate loan portfolio by assessing , \u201c acute physical risk analysis on a sample portfolio of Bank of America residential mortgages across the US Each property was given a score based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential hazards : tornado , earthquake , tropical cyclone , hailstorm , wildfire , river flood , flash flood , coastal flood , lightning , tsunami , volcano , and winter storm.\n\u201d As well , the banks \u2019 investment \u201c risk \u201d in oil and gas as well as other industrial sectors is reviewed using the criteria of Carney \u2019 s TCFD .\nAll risks are defined as related to CO2 , despite the fact there is no conclusive scientific proof that manmade CO2 emission is about to destroy our planet by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity suggests we are entering an unstable cooling period , Grand Solar Minimum .\nThat \u2019 s of no concern to the financial interests who stand to reap trillions in the coming decade .\nAnother key part of the financial preparation for the Great Reset , the fundamental transformation from a high-energy intensity economy to a low and economically inefficient one , is the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ( SASB ) .\nSASB says it \u201c provides a clear set of standards for reporting sustainability information across a wide range of issues\u2026 \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who makes up the members of the SASB that will give the Climate-friendly Imprimatur .\nMembers include , in addition to the world \u2019 s largest fund manager , BlackRock ( more than $ 7 trillion under management ) , also Vanguard Funds , Fidelity Investments , Goldman Sachs , State Street Global , Carlyle Group , Rockefeller Capital Management , and numerous major banks such as Bank of America and UBS .\nMany of these are responsible for the 2008 global financial collapse .\nWhat is this framework group doing ?\nAccording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have has been working towards an ambitious goal of developing and maintaining sustainability accounting standards for 77 industries.\n\u201d Where this is all going is to create a web of globally-based financial entities who control combined wealth including insurance and pension funds into what they claim to be worth $ 100 trillion .\nThey are setting the rules and will define a company or even a country by the degree of carbon emission they create .\nIf you are clean and green , you potentially get investment .\nIf you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gas and coal industries are deemed today , the global capital flows will disinvest or avoid funding you .\nThe immediate target of this financial cabal is the backbone of the world economy , the oil and gas industry along with coal .\n[ It has also geopolitical and strategic implications ] .\nThe immediate target of this financial cartel is the backbone of the world economy , the oil , coal and natural gas sector .\nOil industry analysts predict that over the next five years or less investment flows into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fall dramatically .\n\u201c Given how central the energy transition will be to every company \u2019 s growth prospects , we are asking companies to disclose a plan for how their business model will be compatible with a net zero economy , \u201d BlackRock \u2019 s chairman and CEO Larry Fink wrote in his 2021 letter to CEOs .\nBlackrock is the world \u2019 s largest investment group with over $ 7 trillion to invest .\nAnother BlackRock officer told a recent energy conference , \u201c where BlackRock goes , others will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , portfolios have to be built around core advantaged assets \u2013 low-cost , long-life , low carbon-intensive barrels , \u201d said Andrew Latham , Vice President , Global Exploration at WoodMac , an energy consultancy .\nThe Biden Administration is already making good on his pledge to phase out oil and gas by banning new leases in Federal lands and offshore and the Keystone XL oil pipeline .\nThe oil and gas sector and its derivatives such as petrochemicals are at the heart of the world economy .\nThe 50 largest oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including both state-owned and publicly traded companies , recorded revenues of about $ 5.4 trillion in 2015 .\nAs a new Biden Administration pushes their ideological opposition to so-called fossil fuels , the world will see a precipitous decline in oil and gas investment .\nThe role of the Davos globalists and the ESG financial players are out to guarantee that .\nAnd the losers will be us .\nEnergy prices will skyrocket as they did during the recent Texas blizzards .\nThe cost of electricity in industrial countries will become prohibitive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is all part of the ongoing Great Reset and its new doctrine of ESG investing .\nIn 2010 the head of Working Group 3 of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Dr Otmar Edenhofer , told an interviewer , \u201c \u2026one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world \u2019 s wealth by climate policy .\nOne has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy .\nThis has

MINNEAPOLIS , MN ) \u2013 Opening arguments in State of Minnesota vs. Derek Chauvin are set to begin on Monday morning , as prosecutors are expected to portray the defendant , Chauvin , as an aggressive cop with racial animus towards the victim , George Floyd , who died while in the care of Chauvin and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The defense will rely heavily on medical evidence in its case to cast doubt on the state \u2019 s argument that Floyd \u2019 s death was \u2018 substantially \u2019 caused by Chauvin kneeling on his neck .\nIf you \u2019 ve been following pre-trial events both inside and outside the courtroom , the issue of race has remained dominant in the conversation about this case .\nAnd yet we \u2019 ve known from the very beginning , when the state first filed charges against the defendant , Derek Chauvin , on May 29th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of George Floyd , Minnesota \u2019 s \u2018 hate crime \u2019 statute , 609.2233 , was never and still isn \u2019 t part of state \u2019 s charges against Chauvin \u2013 which currently stand at second degree murder and second degree manslaughter .\nThis key point has been largely absent from the media coverage of the case , statements and actions by state and city officials , and Floyd \u2019 s family attorneys \u2013 and it \u2019 s been quite the opposite actually .\nThis all belies even the summer of \u2018 racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endured .\nThe $ 27 million \u201c George Floyd settlement press conference \u201d was streamed live by the city of Minneapolis on March 12 , 2021 during the first week of jury selection in the criminal case .\nMayor Jacob Frey spoke at the podium ( pictured above ) with a masked Benjamin Crump ( left ) , the Floyd family \u2019 s lead attorney .\nOn the eve of quite possibly the highest profile criminal case in several decades \u2013 think this generation \u2019 s O.J .\nSimpson Trial \u2013 race again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparked all of this talk of race stemmed from the horribly tragic scene caught on video of a white police officer , Chauvin , kneeling on the neck of George Floyd , a black man , who later died while in the care of Chauvin and the other officers .\nBut none of the officers involved , including the principal defendant , Mr. Chauvin , now ex-cop , who was fired after the incident by the Minneapolis Police Department , led by Police Chief Medaria Arradondo , also a black man , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias attached to the state \u2019 s hate crime statute .\nOpening statements in criminal cases in Minnesota typically do not include visual aids , such as pictures , audio and video \u2013 it \u2019 s still unclear if both sides have agreed to allow them .\nBut if they are allowed in , you can be almost certain the now infamous bystander video taken of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd \u2019 s neck that went viral around the world will be shown by the state during its opening statement .\nWhat to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Attorney Jerry Blackwell will give the state \u2019 s opening arguments .\nBlackwell is the founding partner , CEO and chairman of Blackwell Burke P.A .\nHe is also founder of the Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers .\nHe was not involved in questioning potential jurors .\nThe defendant , Chauvin , is likely to be painted as a \u2018 Mark Fuhrman \u2019 type , conjuring up images in the jurors \u2019 heads who might remember the evidence that O.J .\nSimpson \u2019 s defense team presented in that other high profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as an aggressive cop with allegations he had some level of ( how far will Blackwell go with this ? )\nracial animus towards Floyd , and showed criminal intent by keeping his knee on Floyd \u2019 s neck long after Floyd cried out \u2018 I can \u2019 t breath \u2019 to officers .\nWhat to expect from the defense \u2019 s opening arguments : Lead defense attorney Eric Nelson will give the defense \u2019 s opening arguments .\nNelson is managing partner at Halberg Criminal Defense , and also works with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Peace Officers Association \u2013 the organization that is funding Chauvin \u2019 s defense .\nHe also led the jury selection process for the defense .\nNelson is expected to focus on the medical evidence in the case , including giving jurors a preview of what they will hear from witness testimony , including the Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner , regarding Floyd \u2019 s post-mortem toxicology report \u2013 making the argument that there \u2019 s reasonable doubt that Floyd could not have died only because of Chauvin \u2019 s actions .\nIn @ @

"Arab Spring Redux: Is Myanmar Next Libya?", "content": "The age-old adage of history repeating itself because of a collective failure to learn from history \u2019 s lessons rings true yet again .\nIn so many ways , this current situation in Asia reflects the early stages of the Arab Spring .\nIn recent years , political instability has gradually been building in key strategic parts of Asia , accompanied by political pressure from Western powers and familiar calls for intervention to \u2018 protect the people and restore democracy.\n\u2019 This is happening alongside increasingly hostile Western rhetoric towards China .\nAs Western media influence continues building across Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and directed by Washington and its allies .\nIn this analysis , we will compare the geopolitical moves and motivations which drove the Arab Spring with those now unfolding in Asia .\nThe 2011 US-engineered \u201c Arab Spring \u201d was one of the largest and most ambitious attempts at region-wide geopolitical reordering since the Second World War .\nIt engulfed a region stretching from North Africa , across the Levant , to the Middle East and even into Central Asia .\nIt involved opposition groups trained , funded , and equipped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media and tech giants like Facebook and Google \u2013 years before the first protests began in 2011 .\nThe New York Times in its April 2011 article , \u201c U.S .\nGroups Helped Nurture Arab Uprisings , \u201d would admit : The International Republican Institute , National Democratic Institute , and Freedom House are all in turn subsidiaries of the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) \u2013 described by the NYT as : Evidence of this training can be traced back to as early as 2008 where the above-mentioned April 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City at the inaugural \u201c Alliance of Youth Movements ( AYM ) summit sponsored by the US State Department , Google , Facebook , MSNBC , YouTube , CBS News , and Columbia Law School .\nPreparations for the 2011 Arab Spring also included the cultivation of heavily armed militant groups who were meant to exploit the unrest being engineered across the region .\nSigns were clearly visible as early as 2007 , like with veteran journalist Seymour Hersh \u2019 s article , \u201c The Redirection : Is the Administration \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war on terrorism ?\n\u201d which warned of US support for the very extremists that would \u201c rise \u201d up out of the Arab Spring chaos .\nTo undermine Iran , which is predominantly Shiite , the Bush Administration has decided , in effect , to reconfigure its priorities in the Middle East .\nIn Lebanon , the Administration has co\u00f6perated with Saudi Arabia \u2019 s government , which is Sunni , in clandestine operations that are intended to weaken Hezbollah , the Shiite organization that is backed by Iran .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria .\nA by-product of these activities has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and sympathetic to Al Qaeda .\nWhile the US and its regional allies would feign surprise and alarm over the rise of extremist militant factions across North Africa and the Middle East from 2011 onward \u2013 it was always a very deliberate part of the plan , laid out years before it ever unfolded .\nThe protests \u2013 led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political opposition groups \u2013 led to violence deliberately mischaracterized by Western-funded fronts posing as human rights advocacy groups .\nThe violence served as a pretext for the introduction of militant groups openly backed by the US and its allies which then served as a pretext for direct Western military intervention under the pretext of \u201c Responsibility to Protect \u201d also known as \u201c R2P.\n\u201d The result of the Arab Spring and subsequent US military interventions was the complete destruction of Libya , the near complete destruction of Syria , enduring political instability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Yemen into what the UN now considers the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth today , as well as spill over of extremism and violence across North Africa and the Middle East , including the rise of the so-called \u201c Islamic State \u201d and its persistence for years in Syria and Iraq .\nThe chaos triggered by the US-engineered Arab Spring has served as a pretext for a continued US military presence across a region of the planet spanning North Africa , the Middle East , and Central Asia .\nAll of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of Western-backed political opposition groups , the use of fronts posing as human rights advocacy groups , Western-sponsored militant groups \u2013 in understanding the next destructive chapter of US-driven , region-wide geopolitical reordering \u2013 this time unfolding across Asia .\nThe US-engineered Arab Spring was the culmination of Near East geopolitical ambitions best summarized by retired US Army General Wesley Clark in a series of talks and in his memoirs , describing Washington \u2019 s drive to achieve global hegemony after the collapse of the Soviet Union , before any other global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his 2007 article for Salon , \u201c Seven countries in five years , \u201d writer Joe Conason would explain : And through the Arab Spring , this is precisely what the US attempted to achieve .\nIf the Arab Spring , which began in 2011 , was aimed at denying a reemerging Russia or a rising China access to the nations of North Africa and the Middle East as viable partners and allies \u2013 then it is all but certain that a new wave of US-backed political subversion will hit Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is part of a decades-long US strategy to encircle and contain China \u2019 s rise .\nThe Vietnam War fought between the 1950 \u2019 s and 1970 \u2019 s was not only an attempt to maintain Western hegemony over Indochina and contain Soviet inflence , but admittedly an attempt to ultimately encircle and contain China .\nWithin the so-called \u201c Pentagon Papers \u201d released in 1969 , it was revealed that the conflict was one part of a greater strategy aimed at containing and controlling China .\nThree important quotes from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first that : Finally , it outlines the immense regional theater the US was engaged in against China at the time by stating : The Pentagon Papers provide for us today the context with which to properly view current tensions in the Indo-Pacific region between the US and China \u2013 with the papers \u2019 contents being echoed in more recent documents like the 2021 \u201c U.S .\nStrategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific \u201d ( PDF ) focused on maintaining \u201c U.S .\nstrategic primacy in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\u201d It is clear what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indo-Pacific region vis-a-vis China .\nIt is also clear how far short the US has come to actually accomplishing this .\nWhile the nations of Asia had at one point counted the US and other Western nations as prominent if not primary trade partners in past decades \u2013 today this has changed entirely .\nChina is the largest trade partner of nearly every nation in Asia \u2013 including Japan and South Korea \u2013 two supposedly stalwart US allies .\nThe nations of Southeast Asia count China as their largest trade partner , investor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region \u2019 s largest arms suppliers .\nChina is also building region-spanning infrastructure projects ranging from ports , pipelines , and highways , to a high-speed railway that will connect China \u2019 s southern city of Kunming to Laos , and Thailand .\nBeyond China \u2019 s growing relationships , influence , and strength within Asia , it is also building ties beyond the region , with Russia , nations in the Middle East , Europe , Africa , as well as Central and South America .\nHence , in terms of encircling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have failed .\nIn a bid to reverse this failure , the US has resorted to increasingly aggressive \u2013 if not desperate measures .\nThis includes attempts to trigger a regional \u201c spring \u201d in the same fashion the US divided and destroyed the regions of North Africa and the Middle East .\nWithin China in places like Hong Kong , Taiwan , Xinjiang , and Tibet , the US is backing separatists , violent protests , and even terrorism .\nAlong China \u2019 s peripheries , opposition movements from Thailand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines , and Vietnam \u2013 and now Myanmar \u2013 seek to either destabilize and destroy Asia \u2019 s prosperity to spite a rising China , or turn the region entirely against China .\nThrough the National Endowment for Democracy , entire political parties and street movements have been created as fifth columns , to be turned against targeted nations , their governments , and their institutions .\nActivist Joshua Wong in Washington , used by US legislators as the face of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act ( 2019 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any role in political unrest across the region , it has already openly backed violent riots in Hong Kong which culminated with protest leaders like Joshua Wong finally flying to Washington D.C. to appeal directly to the US government for wider and more direct support , albeit too late .\nProtesters were lauded by US Senators and Congressman and given a platform to speak directly with US legislators .\nNumerous other similar opposition-building operations for other Asian nations are also underway .\nFor Cambodia , the political opposition is literally based in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ousting the current government and undermining and removing the constitutional monarchy \u2013 an institution that has unified and protected Thailand against Western imperialism for centuries \u2013 was quietly funded and supported via the National Endowment for Democracy for years , and eventually openly backed by a US Senate resolution late last year .\nIn each of these countries \u2013 China , Cambodia , and Thailand , US-backed subversion has been more or less supported and managed remotely .\nHowever , the real danger now lies in Myanmar , a key Southeast Asian country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bangladesh , India , and Laos .\nMyanmar has suffered for decades since declaring its independence from the British Empire \u2013 undermined by a combination of armed ethnic groups backed by the West and a growing army of fronts posing as \u201c nongovernmental organizations \u201d creating a parallel government within Myanmar \u2019 s own borders \u2013 a parallel government that had begun easily engineering elections , had full control of the media , and began working its way into virtually every other aspect of independent Myanmar \u2019 s internal political and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply be described as Myanmar \u2019 s recolonization .\nThe political opposition in Myanmar is led by Aung San Suu Kyi ( image , left ) and her National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party .\nOnce feted by the West as an icon of democracy and awarded a Nobel Peace Prize , she is now a target of Western political and media institutions , with some accusing her of being party to genocide in Myanmar .\nSuu Kyi herself has personally travelled to Washington DC and London on multiple occasions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US National Endowment for Democracy \u2013 which funds and directs the vast political network supporting her and her NLD party .\nShe has also attended NED events to award and encourage others carrying out political subversion in Myanmar .\nIndeed , some analysts have pointed out how Western pressure placed on Suu Kyi in recent years since taking power in 2015 \u2013 claiming she had begun pivoting Myanmar toward China , but this is only half the picture .\nSuu Kyi \u2019 s cooperation with China and Myanmar \u2019 s powerful , independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily an ideological one .\nHer obedience to the West was ultimately limited by the lack of alternatives the West could offer Myanmar in terms of economic ties , the construction of essential infrastructure , and other areas of national development Myanmar sorely lacks after decades of sociopolitical instability .\nWestern pressure was aimed at shaping Suu Kyi \u2019 s policies \u2013 not ousting her or her NLD party from power .\nPart of this pressure included helping exacerbate the Rohingya Crisis in Myanmar \u2019 s southwest Rakhine state .\nThis crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides by Western funding to disrupt Chinese infrastructure projects being built in this region as part of Beijing \u2019 s One Belt , One Road initiative .\nSimilar ethnic violence throughout the country has served as cover for attacking Chinese investments in Myanmar .\nWhile this pressure was placed on Suu Kyi , her party and the vast network of faux-NGOs supporting it , remained fully funded and backed by the US and its allies through the NED \u2013 which to this day still funds well over 80 projects that are admitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted to .\nA military takeover of the nation \u2019 s government earlier this year aimed at uprooting this malign influence .\nIt triggered violent protests across the country carried out by Suu Kyi \u2019 s NLD party and the army of fronts funded by the West through organizations like the NED , Open Society , and the British government .\nJust as was done across the Arab World during the 2011 \u201c Arab Spring , \u201d the Western media and an army of faux-human rights advocacy groups report only one side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely carried out by government security forces \u2013 either not explaining the deaths of police and soldiers \u2013 or failing to mention these deaths entirely .\nA parallel government led by NLD members who escaped arrest has been created in territory held by Western-backed militant groups who have stepped up armed violence against Myanmar \u2019 s military since the recent takeover .\nUS-funded fronts like the \u201c Karenni Information Center \u201d have reported on armed factions taking over military outposts , capturing prisoners , and seizing arms and equipment \u2013 in a fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed Libya began in 2011 .\nDubious human rights advocacy groups like the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners ( AAPP ) are regularly and uncritically cited by the Western media regarding death and detainment tallies \u2013 with no mention made that AAPP \u2019 s founder and joint secretary , Ko Bo Kyi , is a US NED \u201c fellow \u201d and his organization itself is a beneficiary of NED support .\nOther organizations like \u201c Myanmar Now \u201d \u2013 an alleged \u201c independent news agency \u201d operating in Myanmar , along with The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVB ) , and many others are also all funded by the US government via the NED .\nMuch of this funding is not transparently listed on the US NED \u2019 s webpage for Myanmar .\nFor example \u2013 Myanmar Now \u2019 s US NED funding was instead revealed in an older article published by the Columbia Journalism Review , 19 paragraphs in , where it claimed : Myanmar Now , which receives funding from the National Endowment for Democracy , prides itself on unflinching coverage of crimes against the Rohingya , dissidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is widely read by foreigners working inside the country .\nThis lack of transparency is meant to preserve the illusion of independence and legitimacy of an opposition movement entirely dependent on and directed by Washington and its allies \u2013 just as was the case in the early phases of the Arab Spring in 2011 .\nWestern influence throughout the media across Southeast Asia \u2013 and its investments in opposition groups in neighboring countries is helping add weight to the propaganda regarding Myanmar \u2019 s growing political crisis .\nPolitical momentum to stampede Myanmar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is building , while the West and its networks in the region continue placing pressure on ASEAN to abandon its principles of non-interference and intervene in Myanmar .\nWithin Myanmar , the opposition is openly invoking the \u201c responsibility to protect \u201d \u2013 US NED-funded media platforms like the Irrawaddy regularly publish op-eds calling for foreign intervention and \u201c responsibility to protect \u201d by name .\nResponsibility to protect was the geopolitical ploy used by US policymakers to justify its military intervention in Libya in 2011 \u2013 which led directly to the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since .\nIn addition to protesters in the streets demanding Western intervention under the guise of \u201c R2P \u201d and US-funded media platforms calling for it in their columns \u2013 Western propagandists are dusting off another gimmick used widely throughout the Arab Spring and subsequent US military interventions \u2013 the use of children to plead for intervention .\nMay Wong , a correspondent for Singapore-based Channel News Asia , shamelessly helped promote a mother exploiting her 9 year old daughter whom she claimed wrote a letter to the UN asking \u201c can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign is reminiscent of the notorious Bana of Aleppo campaign which was used to promote Western military intervention in Syria .\nPerhaps Wong would have served the public better had she rhetorically suggested Serbia , Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , or Syria , as an answer the girl \u2019 s question \u2013 pointing out that everywhere the UN helps \u201c authorize \u201d intervention , Washington \u2019 s war machine follows \u2013 making even the worst accusations made against supposed dictatorships fond memories in comparison to the systematic destruction that soon follows .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab Spring ?\nWhat \u2019 s perhaps most disturbing is that many of the \u201c activists \u201d involved both in the streets of Asia and across the region \u2019 s information space \u2013 regularly and enthusiastically invoke the notion of an \u201c Asian Spring.\n\u201d This is in apparent oblivion to how the Arab Spring of 2011 devolved into chaos , violence , war , the destruction of nations , and the destabilization of regions .\nGovernments across Asia also appear unprepared \u2013 particularly for the accompanying information warfare that comes with US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat in Myanmar what it had done in Libya and partially did in Syria .\nThailand , for example , is already facing an influx of refugees fleeing the violence in Myanmar .\nYet , state-funded media like Thai PBS ( already infiltrated by Western-educated Thais who lean West in their reporting ) continue repeating uncritical narratives identical to that of Western media organizations and various Western-funded opposition groups inside Myanmar itself .\nIn essence , many working across Asia \u2019 s information space are throwing fuel into a fire that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn some cases , those promoting Western narratives regarding Myanmar , and backing other Washington-sponsored opposition groups throughout Asia , do so deliberately because they themselves are funded by or associated with the US and its allies .\nHowever , if governments , media outlets , and institutions across the region not linked to or part of Western interference in the region fail to summon the courage to work against the powerful pressure placed on them by Western embassies , Western media outlets , faux-rights groups funded by the West , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history repeat itself again \u2013 starting in Myanmar , before seeing instability spreading over Thailand \u2019 s borders , and potentially inviting foreign intervention , placing Western troops directly on China \u2019 s borders and tipping off a dangerous confrontation that could last years or even decades .\nThis would compound the slow economic recovery of the region following the COVID-19 economic crisis and mire Asia in the sort of destructive conflicts that have set the Middle East and its respective nations back decades .\nAs an empire in terminal decline , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if it can not have the Indo-Pacific region \u2013 then no one else will either .\nJust as it continues to spite Russia and Iran in Syria by blocking reconstruction after more than a decade of destructive proxy warfare waged against Damascus , the US is now positioned to replicate this pattern in Asia .\nIf this situation comes to pass , then history may judge Asia \u2019 s leaders harshly , not only for allowing a prosperous region be turned into chaos by foreign interference it failed to prepare for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uproot \u2013 but also and perhaps especially because Asia \u2019 s leaders were not paying attention and thus failed to learn the lessons from the Arab Spring and guard their people against its inevitable arrival in Asia .\nChina , for its part , has recently announced close cooperation with Russia and in particular against \u201c color revolutions.\n\u201d Surely there is common ground there , with other nations facing the common threat of color revolutions sponsored by the West \u2013 who can join Moscow and Beijing with urgent efforts required in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as less-intense but still dangerous sedition being sponsored in neighboring Thailand and beyond .\nUltimately , the US is not simply targeting Russia and China with color revolution tactics \u2013 but nations all along their respective peripheries .\nThe US and its allies have long worked closely together to foster chaos and conflict around the globe , and perhaps it is time for those nations , governments and individuals being targeted to work in closer cooperation to achieve collective stability .\n*** Author Brian Berletic , formerly known under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geopolitical researcher , writer and special contributor to

Myanmar the Next Libya?", "content": "The age-old adage of history repeating itself because of a collective failure to learn from history \u2019 s lessons rings true yet again .\nIn so many ways , this current situation in Asia reflects the early stages of the Arab Spring .\nIn recent years , political instability has gradually been building in key strategic parts of Asia , accompanied by political pressure from Western powers and familiar calls for intervention to \u2018 protect the people and restore democracy.\n\u2019 This is happening alongside increasingly hostile Western rhetoric towards China .\nAs Western media influence continues building across Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and directed by Washington and its allies .\nIn this analysis , we will compare the geopolitical moves and motivations which drove the Arab Spring with those now unfolding in Asia .\nThe 2011 US-engineered \u201c Arab Spring \u201d was one of the largest and most ambitious attempts at region-wide geopolitical reordering since the Second World War .\nIt engulfed a region stretching from North Africa , across the Levant , to the Middle East and even into Central Asia .\nIt involved opposition groups trained , funded , and equipped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media and tech giants like Facebook and Google \u2013 years before the first protests began in 2011 .\nThe New York Times in its April 2011 article , \u201c U.S .\nGroups Helped Nurture Arab Uprisings , \u201d would admit : The International Republican Institute , National Democratic Institute , and Freedom House are all in turn subsidiaries of the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) \u2013 described by the NYT as : Evidence of this training can be traced back to as early as 2008 where the above-mentioned April 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City at the inaugural \u201c Alliance of Youth Movements ( AYM ) summit sponsored by the US State Department , Google , Facebook , MSNBC , YouTube , CBS News , and Columbia Law School .\nPreparations for the 2011 Arab Spring also included the cultivation of heavily armed militant groups who were meant to exploit the unrest being engineered across the region .\nSigns were clearly visible as early as 2007 , like with veteran journalist Seymour Hersh \u2019 s article , \u201c The Redirection : Is the Administration \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war on terrorism ?\n\u201d which warned of US support for the very extremists that would \u201c rise \u201d up out of the Arab Spring chaos .\nTo undermine Iran , which is predominantly Shiite , the Bush Administration has decided , in effect , to reconfigure its priorities in the Middle East .\nIn Lebanon , the Administration has co\u00f6perated with Saudi Arabia \u2019 s government , which is Sunni , in clandestine operations that are intended to weaken Hezbollah , the Shiite organization that is backed by Iran .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria .\nA by-product of these activities has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and sympathetic to Al Qaeda .\nWhile the US and its regional allies would feign surprise and alarm over the rise of extremist militant factions across North Africa and the Middle East from 2011 onward \u2013 it was always a very deliberate part of the plan , laid out years before it ever unfolded .\nThe protests \u2013 led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political opposition groups \u2013 led to violence deliberately mischaracterized by Western-funded fronts posing as human rights advocacy groups .\nThe violence served as a pretext for the introduction of militant groups openly backed by the US and its allies which then served as a pretext for direct Western military intervention under the pretext of \u201c Responsibility to Protect \u201d also known as \u201c R2P.\n\u201d The result of the Arab Spring and subsequent US military interventions was the complete destruction of Libya , the near complete destruction of Syria , enduring political instability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Yemen into what the UN now considers the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth today , as well as spill over of extremism and violence across North Africa and the Middle East , including the rise of the so-called \u201c Islamic State \u201d and its persistence for years in Syria and Iraq .\nThe chaos triggered by the US-engineered Arab Spring has served as a pretext for a continued US military presence across a region of the planet spanning North Africa , the Middle East , and Central Asia .\nAll of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of Western-backed political opposition groups , the use of fronts posing as human rights advocacy groups , Western-sponsored militant groups \u2013 in understanding the next destructive chapter of US-driven , region-wide geopolitical reordering \u2013 this time unfolding across Asia .\nThe US-engineered Arab Spring was the culmination of Near East geopolitical ambitions best summarized by retired US Army General Wesley Clark in a series of talks and in his memoirs , describing Washington \u2019 s drive to achieve global hegemony after the collapse of the Soviet Union , before any other global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his 2007 article for Salon , \u201c Seven countries in five years , \u201d writer Joe Conason would explain : And through the Arab Spring , this is precisely what the US attempted to achieve .\nIf the Arab Spring , which began in 2011 , was aimed at denying a reemerging Russia or a rising China access to the nations of North Africa and the Middle East as viable partners and allies \u2013 then it is all but certain that a new wave of US-backed political subversion will hit Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is part of a decades-long US strategy to encircle and contain China \u2019 s rise .\nThe Vietnam War fought between the 1950 \u2019 s and 1970 \u2019 s was not only an attempt to maintain Western hegemony over Indochina and contain Soviet inflence , but admittedly an attempt to ultimately encircle and contain China .\nWithin the so-called \u201c Pentagon Papers \u201d released in 1969 , it was revealed that the conflict was one part of a greater strategy aimed at containing and controlling China .\nThree important quotes from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first that : Finally , it outlines the immense regional theater the US was engaged in against China at the time by stating : The Pentagon Papers provide for us today the context with which to properly view current tensions in the Indo-Pacific region between the US and China \u2013 with the papers \u2019 contents being echoed in more recent documents like the 2021 \u201c U.S .\nStrategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific \u201d ( PDF ) focused on maintaining \u201c U.S .\nstrategic primacy in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\u201d It is clear what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indo-Pacific region vis-a-vis China .\nIt is also clear how far short the US has come to actually accomplishing this .\nWhile the nations of Asia had at one point counted the US and other Western nations as prominent if not primary trade partners in past decades \u2013 today this has changed entirely .\nChina is the largest trade partner of nearly every nation in Asia \u2013 including Japan and South Korea \u2013 two supposedly stalwart US allies .\nThe nations of Southeast Asia count China as their largest trade partner , investor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region \u2019 s largest arms suppliers .\nChina is also building region-spanning infrastructure projects ranging from ports , pipelines , and highways , to a high-speed railway that will connect China \u2019 s southern city of Kunming to Laos , and Thailand .\nBeyond China \u2019 s growing relationships , influence , and strength within Asia , it is also building ties beyond the region , with Russia , nations in the Middle East , Europe , Africa , as well as Central and South America .\nHence , in terms of encircling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have failed .\nIn a bid to reverse this failure , the US has resorted to increasingly aggressive \u2013 if not desperate measures .\nThis includes attempts to trigger a regional \u201c spring \u201d in the same fashion the US divided and destroyed the regions of North Africa and the Middle East .\nWithin China in places like Hong Kong , Taiwan , Xinjiang , and Tibet , the US is backing separatists , violent protests , and even terrorism .\nAlong China \u2019 s peripheries , opposition movements from Thailand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines , and Vietnam \u2013 and now Myanmar \u2013 seek to either destabilize and destroy Asia \u2019 s prosperity to spite a rising China , or turn the region entirely against China .\nThrough the National Endowment for Democracy , entire political parties and street movements have been created as fifth columns , to be turned against targeted nations , their governments , and their institutions .\nActivist Joshua Wong in Washington , used by US legislators as the face of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act ( 2019 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any role in political unrest across the region , it has already openly backed violent riots in Hong Kong which culminated with protest leaders like Joshua Wong finally flying to Washington D.C. to appeal directly to the US government for wider and more direct support , albeit too late .\nProtesters were lauded by US Senators and Congressman and given a platform to speak directly with US legislators .\nNumerous other similar opposition-building operations for other Asian nations are also underway .\nFor Cambodia , the political opposition is literally based in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ousting the current government and undermining and removing the constitutional monarchy \u2013 an institution that has unified and protected Thailand against Western imperialism for centuries \u2013 was quietly funded and supported via the National Endowment for Democracy for years , and eventually openly backed by a US Senate resolution late last year .\nIn each of these countries \u2013 China , Cambodia , and Thailand , US-backed subversion has been more or less supported and managed remotely .\nHowever , the real danger now lies in Myanmar , a key Southeast Asian country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bangladesh , India , and Laos .\nMyanmar has suffered for decades since declaring its independence from the British Empire \u2013 undermined by a combination of armed ethnic groups backed by the West and a growing army of fronts posing as \u201c nongovernmental organizations \u201d creating a parallel government within Myanmar \u2019 s own borders \u2013 a parallel government that had begun easily engineering elections , had full control of the media , and began working its way into virtually every other aspect of independent Myanmar \u2019 s internal political and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply be described as Myanmar \u2019 s recolonization .\nThe political opposition in Myanmar is led by Aung San Suu Kyi ( image , left ) and her National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party .\nOnce feted by the West as an icon of democracy and awarded a Nobel Peace Prize , she is now a target of Western political and media institutions , with some accusing her of being party to genocide in Myanmar .\nSuu Kyi herself has personally travelled to Washington DC and London on multiple occasions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US National Endowment for Democracy \u2013 which funds and directs the vast political network supporting her and her NLD party .\nShe has also attended NED events to award and encourage others carrying out political subversion in Myanmar .\nIndeed , some analysts have pointed out how Western pressure placed on Suu Kyi in recent years since taking power in 2015 \u2013 claiming she had begun pivoting Myanmar toward China , but this is only half the picture .\nSuu Kyi \u2019 s cooperation with China and Myanmar \u2019 s powerful , independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily an ideological one .\nHer obedience to the West was ultimately limited by the lack of alternatives the West could offer Myanmar in terms of economic ties , the construction of essential infrastructure , and other areas of national development Myanmar sorely lacks after decades of sociopolitical instability .\nWestern pressure was aimed at shaping Suu Kyi \u2019 s policies \u2013 not ousting her or her NLD party from power .\nPart of this pressure included helping exacerbate the Rohingya Crisis in Myanmar \u2019 s southwest Rakhine state .\nThis crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides by Western funding to disrupt Chinese infrastructure projects being built in this region as part of Beijing \u2019 s One Belt , One Road initiative .\nSimilar ethnic violence throughout the country has served as cover for attacking Chinese investments in Myanmar .\nWhile this pressure was placed on Suu Kyi , her party and the vast network of faux-NGOs supporting it , remained fully funded and backed by the US and its allies through the NED \u2013 which to this day still funds well over 80 projects that are admitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted to .\nA military takeover of the nation \u2019 s government earlier this year aimed at uprooting this malign influence .\nIt triggered violent protests across the country carried out by Suu Kyi \u2019 s NLD party and the army of fronts funded by the West through organizations like the NED , Open Society , and the British government .\nJust as was done across the Arab World during the 2011 \u201c Arab Spring , \u201d the Western media and an army of faux-human rights advocacy groups report only one side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely carried out by government security forces \u2013 either not explaining the deaths of police and soldiers \u2013 or failing to mention these deaths entirely .\nA parallel government led by NLD members who escaped arrest has been created in territory held by Western-backed militant groups who have stepped up armed violence against Myanmar \u2019 s military since the recent takeover .\nUS-funded fronts like the \u201c Karenni Information Center \u201d have reported on armed factions taking over military outposts , capturing prisoners , and seizing arms and equipment \u2013 in a fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed Libya began in 2011 .\nDubious human rights advocacy groups like the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners ( AAPP ) are regularly and uncritically cited by the Western media regarding death and detainment tallies \u2013 with no mention made that AAPP \u2019 s founder and joint secretary , Ko Bo Kyi , is a US NED \u201c fellow \u201d and his organization itself is a beneficiary of NED support .\nOther organizations like \u201c Myanmar Now \u201d \u2013 an alleged \u201c independent news agency \u201d operating in Myanmar , along with The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVB ) , and many others are also all funded by the US government via the NED .\nMuch of this funding is not transparently listed on the US NED \u2019 s webpage for Myanmar .\nFor example \u2013 Myanmar Now \u2019 s US NED funding was instead revealed in an older article published by the Columbia Journalism Review , 19 paragraphs in , where it claimed : Myanmar Now , which receives funding from the National Endowment for Democracy , prides itself on unflinching coverage of crimes against the Rohingya , dissidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is widely read by foreigners working inside the country .\nThis lack of transparency is meant to preserve the illusion of independence and legitimacy of an opposition movement entirely dependent on and directed by Washington and its allies \u2013 just as was the case in the early phases of the Arab Spring in 2011 .\nWestern influence throughout the media across Southeast Asia \u2013 and its investments in opposition groups in neighboring countries is helping add weight to the propaganda regarding Myanmar \u2019 s growing political crisis .\nPolitical momentum to stampede Myanmar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is building , while the West and its networks in the region continue placing pressure on ASEAN to abandon its principles of non-interference and intervene in Myanmar .\nWithin Myanmar , the opposition is openly invoking the \u201c responsibility to protect \u201d \u2013 US NED-funded media platforms like the Irrawaddy regularly publish op-eds calling for foreign intervention and \u201c responsibility to protect \u201d by name .\nResponsibility to protect was the geopolitical ploy used by US policymakers to justify its military intervention in Libya in 2011 \u2013 which led directly to the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since .\nIn addition to protesters in the streets demanding Western intervention under the guise of \u201c R2P \u201d and US-funded media platforms calling for it in their columns \u2013 Western propagandists are dusting off another gimmick used widely throughout the Arab Spring and subsequent US military interventions \u2013 the use of children to plead for intervention .\nMay Wong , a correspondent for Singapore-based Channel News Asia , shamelessly helped promote a mother exploiting her 9 year old daughter whom she claimed wrote a letter to the UN asking \u201c can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign is reminiscent of the notorious Bana of Aleppo campaign which was used to promote Western military intervention in Syria .\nPerhaps Wong would have served the public better had she rhetorically suggested Serbia , Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , or Syria , as an answer the girl \u2019 s question \u2013 pointing out that everywhere the UN helps \u201c authorize \u201d intervention , Washington \u2019 s war machine follows \u2013 making even the worst accusations made against supposed dictatorships fond memories in comparison to the systematic destruction that soon follows .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab Spring ?\nWhat \u2019 s perhaps most disturbing is that many of the \u201c activists \u201d involved both in the streets of Asia and across the region \u2019 s information space \u2013 regularly and enthusiastically invoke the notion of an \u201c Asian Spring.\n\u201d This is in apparent oblivion to how the Arab Spring of 2011 devolved into chaos , violence , war , the destruction of nations , and the destabilization of regions .\nGovernments across Asia also appear unprepared \u2013 particularly for the accompanying information warfare that comes with US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat in Myanmar what it had done in Libya and partially did in Syria .\nThailand , for example , is already facing an influx of refugees fleeing the violence in Myanmar .\nYet , state-funded media like Thai PBS ( already infiltrated by Western-educated Thais who lean West in their reporting ) continue repeating uncritical narratives identical to that of Western media organizations and various Western-funded opposition groups inside Myanmar itself .\nIn essence , many working across Asia \u2019 s information space are throwing fuel into a fire that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn some cases , those promoting Western narratives regarding Myanmar , and backing other Washington-sponsored opposition groups throughout Asia , do so deliberately because they themselves are funded by or associated with the US and its allies .\nHowever , if governments , media outlets , and institutions across the region not linked to or part of Western interference in the region fail to summon the courage to work against the powerful pressure placed on them by Western embassies , Western media outlets , faux-rights groups funded by the West , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history repeat itself again \u2013 starting in Myanmar , before seeing instability spreading over Thailand \u2019 s borders , and potentially inviting foreign intervention , placing Western troops directly on China \u2019 s borders and tipping off a dangerous confrontation that could last years or even decades .\nThis would compound the slow economic recovery of the region following the COVID-19 economic crisis and mire Asia in the sort of destructive conflicts that have set the Middle East and its respective nations back decades .\nAs an empire in terminal decline , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if it can not have the Indo-Pacific region \u2013 then no one else will either .\nJust as it continues to spite Russia and Iran in Syria by blocking reconstruction after more than a decade of destructive proxy warfare waged against Damascus , the US is now positioned to replicate this pattern in Asia .\nIf this situation comes to pass , then history may judge Asia \u2019 s leaders harshly , not only for allowing a prosperous region be turned into chaos by foreign interference it failed to prepare for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uproot \u2013 but also and perhaps especially because Asia \u2019 s leaders were not paying attention and thus failed to learn the lessons from the Arab Spring and guard their people against its inevitable arrival in Asia .\nChina , for its part , has recently announced close cooperation with Russia and in particular against \u201c color revolutions.\n\u201d Surely there is common ground there , with other nations facing the common threat of color revolutions sponsored by the West \u2013 who can join Moscow and Beijing with urgent efforts required in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as less-intense but still dangerous sedition being sponsored in neighboring Thailand and beyond .\nUltimately , the US is not simply targeting Russia and China with color revolution tactics \u2013 but nations all along their respective peripheries .\nThe US and its allies have long worked closely together to foster chaos and conflict around the globe , and perhaps it is time for those nations , governments and individuals being targeted to work in closer cooperation to achieve collective stability .\n*** Author Brian

\u2019 s the sign of someone who has taken responsibility for his own health and welfare .\nAsk yourself this : Why would a normal , rational person be eager to have an experimental cocktail injected into his bloodstream potentially triggering all manner of long-term ailments or death ?\nIs that the choice a normal person would make ?\nAs far as I can see , behavioral psychologists are playing a critical role in this mass vaccination campaign .\nAccording to a report put out by the National Institutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid response team has been formed to attack the opinions of people who challenge the \u201c official narrative \u201d .\nCheck out this blurb from the report titled , \u201c COVID-19 Vaccination : Communication : Applying Behavioral and Social Science to Address Vaccine Hesitancy and Foster Vaccine Confidence \u201d : The spread of health-related misinformation was a significant public health concern well before the COVID-19 pandemic .\nDuring the last decade , vaccine-related discourse online and in the media has been plagued by misinformation .\nAnti-vaccine groups have leveraged political and social divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false narratives questioning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines , spread false claims about adverse outcomes , and downplayed the risks of the disease \u2019 s vaccines protect against.\u2026 .\nCOVID-19 vaccine communication efforts can not ignore misinformation and must take actions , informed by behavioral and communication research , to identify emerging rumors and respond in a way that is informed by behavioral science .\nReal-time , agile , and scalable monitoring of discourse concerning COVID 19 vaccination\u2014including conspiracy theories , rumors , and myths\u2014can support a swiftly developed and implemented response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the most prominent sources of misinformation , the tactics being used , and the groups most at risk of being exposed to and influenced by the rumors .\nThis information , in addition to data regarding the dynamics and patterns of misinformation spread , could help inform the appropriate response and best targets for intervention efforts\u2026 .\nCorrecting the false claim contained in the message , exposing the tactics used by disinformation agents , and inducing skepticism by highlighting the ulterior motives of these actors are all potentially effective strategies for mitigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very scary stuff .\nAgents of the state now identify critics of the Covid vaccine as their mortal enemies .\nHow did we get here ?\nAnd how did we get to the point where the government is targeting people who don \u2019 t agree with them ?\nThis is way beyond Orwell .\nWe have entered some creepy alternate universe .\nHere \u2019 s more on the topic from a statement by Arthur C. Evans Jr. , PhD , CEO of the American Psychological Association , in response to the approval by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drug Administration of a vaccine against COVID-19 : \u201c We recognize that there are pockets of resistance to vaccines , distrust of the medical establishment and misinformation about vaccines generally\u2026.Some populations are understandably less likely to accept vaccinations due to a legacy of mistrust rooted in unethical public health practices .\n\u201c It is critical that leaders across the political spectrum unite behind messages of vaccine safety and transparency.\n\u201d ..\nEnlist credible spokespeople who can connect with diverse communities , especially those where mistrust and skepticism run high .\nWhen leaders talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to options , people are more likely to accept them .\nResearch suggests building trust and providing clear information about vaccines can improve vaccination uptake rates .\nIt is critical that leaders across the political spectrum unite behind vaccine safety and transparency , clearly explaining what is in the vaccine and what it does and doesn \u2019 t do in the body .\nConsider the wide variety of factors that motivate human behavior .\nBehavioral science indicates that people are more likely to adhere to vaccine recommendations when they believe they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to protect others , when they believe the vaccine is safe or at least safer than the illness , and when their concerns and questions are managed respectfully by doctors and experts.\n\u201d Is it really ethical for the APA to be involved in a mass vaccination campaign ?\nIs this the role an organization like this should play in a democratic society ?\nShould the APA use its unique understanding of human behavior to persuade people on behalf of the government and big pharma ?\nSEE ALSO : Document Reveals \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockdown And , more importantly , if behavioral psychologists helped to shape the government \u2019 s strategy on mass vaccination , then in what other policies were they involved ?\nWere these the \u201c professionals \u201d who conjured up the pandemic restrictions ?\nWere the masks , the social distancing and the lockdowns all promoted by \u201c experts \u201d as a way to undermine normal human relations and inflict the maximum psychological pain on the American people ?\nWas the intention to create a weak and submissive population that would willingly accept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restructuring of the economy , and the imposition of a new political order ?\n\u201d These questions need to be answered .\nSurprisingly , the resistance to vaccination is nearly as strong today as it was a year ago .\nAccording to PEW Research : So , despite the nonstop propaganda blitz , a significant portion of the population remains unconvinced , unimpressed and steadfast .\nGo figure ?\nOf course , this is just Round 1 .\nSoon , persuasion will turn into coercion , and from coercion to outright force .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require vaccine passports , and that public transit , concerts , libraries , restaurants and , perhaps , even grocery stores could follow soon after .\nVaccination looks to be the defining issue of the next few years at least .\nAnd those who resist the edicts of the state will increasingly find themselves on the outside ; outcasts in their own

initial reaction should have been for many \u2013 a flashback to the last time R2P was invoked \u2013 in 2011 by the West regarding Libya .\nThe violence in Libya in 2011 was part of the wider US-engineered \u201c Arab Spring \u201d with opposition groups , fronts posing as nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and even armed factions all backed by the US and prepared years in advance to carry out a region-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military intervention , and occupation .\nAt the time , many \u2013 including US Senator John McCain , promised the \u201c Arab Spring \u201d would spread \u2013 deliberately and as part of Washington \u2019 s desire to encircle , contain , and eventually overthrow the political and economic orders of Iran , Russia , and China .\nThe Atlantic in a 2011 article titled , \u201c The Arab Spring : \u2018 A Virus That Will Attack Moscow and Beijing \u2019 , \u201d would even note : Despite the ultimate failure of the US-engineered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond Libya \u2013 it still managed to destabilize or otherwise destroy the regions of North Africa and the Middle East \u2013 create a pretext for a permanent US military presence there , including an enduring occupation of Syria \u2019 s eastern region , and the creation of a ongoing conflict that could easily be described as a proxy war against Iran \u2013 one of the nations the 2011 Arab Spring was ultimately aimed at .\nSEE ALSO : Arab Spring Redux : Is Myanmar the Next Libya ?\nMcCain was a stalwart supporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases of the Arab Spring .\nHe met with US-armed and backed terrorists both in Libya and Syria until his death in 2018 .\nWhen he declared US-engineered conflict would eventually reach Moscow and Beijing \u2013 it was clear even at the time that it would , by necessity , first need to arrive in and erode the stability of nations along the peripheries of both Russia and China .\nAnd this is a process that has continued ever since \u2013 with US-backed \u201c color revolution \u201d attacking Ukraine in 2013-2014 , Belarus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and along its peripheries \u2013 deadly separatism in China \u2019 s Xinjiang region , violent riots in Hong Kong , opposition groups in Thailand openly opposed to close relations between Bangkok and Beijing , and now the crisis in Myanmar .\nThe protests in Myanmar in response to the ousting of the US-backed government of Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy ( NLD ) earlier this year \u2013 began violently .\nThese were the same political groups that had stormed Rohingya communities years earlier \u2013 killing residents and burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is unlikely that since then , they \u2019 ve adopted \u201c peaceful \u201d methods .\nTo help spin the violent nature of the protests \u2013 the Western media has depended heavily on faux-human rights groups like Assistance Association for Political Prisoners ( AAPP ) who provides baseless \u201c tallies \u201d of dead and detained .\nThe Western media never mentions that AAPP is funded by the US government via the National Endowment for Democracy and that the AAPP \u2019 s founder and and joint secretary \u2013 Ko Bo Kyi \u2013 is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were used by the West in Libya and Syria \u2013 including the Libyan League for Human Rights and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights respectively .\nVideos of protesters with machetes , swords , bows and arrows , Molotov cocktails , and other weapons fighting with police and soldiers were even broadcasted by the Western media \u2013 and occasional mention of police and soldiers dying in the violence was also made .\nBut overall \u2013 the Western media maintained a narrative of a one-sided \u201c massacre \u201d of \u201c peaceful protesters \u201d by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember similar narratives told regarding the opening phases of the conflicts in Libya and Syria in 2011 .\nWestern media outlets like the BBC and Reuters attempted to portray the opposition in Libya and Syria as \u201c peaceful \u201d up to and including when footage of opposition groups with war weapons \u2013 including tanks \u2013 began emerging .\nOnce it became public knowledge of just how heavily armed and organized the opposition was \u2013 and when it came time for the US and its allies to openly arm and support them \u2013 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c peaceful protesters \u201d had \u201c no choice \u201d but to take up arms .\nThe exact same narrative now plays out in Myanmar .\nMyanmar Now \u2013 funded by the US government via the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) as revealed in a Columbia Journalism Review article \u2013 in a recent pieces titled , \u201c As slaughter of civilians continues , some decide it \u2019 s time to take up arms , \u201d would attempt to sell a similar narrative today .\nThe article then explains how \u2013 only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government has already been formed and a \u201c federal army \u201d is already prepared to fight Myanmar \u2019 s military for control of the country .\nThese \u201c forces opposed to the regime \u201d include armed ethnic groups that have for decades received funding , equipment , and weapons from the United States through fronts posing as NGOs \u2013 many of them listed on the US government \u2019 s own National Endowment for Democracy website .\nJust like in Libya and Syria \u2013 the Western media and US-funded propaganda outlets like Myanmar Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u201c pro-democracy \u201d force of \u201c freedom fighters \u201d \u2013 that in reality \u2013 is clearly composed of armed

\u2019 s government \u2013 and if successful \u2013 with each other in the aftermath .\nThe CRPH \u2013 in the days and weeks to come \u2013 will undoubtedly be recognized by the US and its allies as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it then possible for the US and others to arm , fund , and otherwise aid them in their bid to seize total power over the country .\nThere will also likely be the opportunity for the US to propose limited military intervention \u2013 citing the use of Myanmar \u2019 s air force against opposition groups armed with war weapons \u2013 just as the US did in Libya and attempted ( and partially did ) in Syria .\nThe proxy regime will be able to \u201c invite \u201d the US military into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario for a US desperate to encircle China with its military \u2013 especially by placing its troops in a nation that directly borders China as Myanmar does .\nThe US promised its Arab Spring would spread \u2013 like a virus \u2013 to the doorsteps of Moscow and Beijing .\nFor China \u2013 with Myanmar clearly infected and slowly dying on its border \u2013 that day has now come .\n*** Author Brian Berletic , formerly known under his pen name \u201c Tony

Iran Nuclear Deal \u2013 Washington \u2019 s return to the deal has predictably stalled .\nIn February 2021 , AP would report in its article , \u201c Biden repudiates Trump on Iran , ready for talks on nuke deal , \u201d that : The US had unilaterally withdrawn from the 2015-2016 deal brokered under the Obama-Biden administration in 2018 under US President Donald Trump .\nThe deal was deemed

and only after additional conditions are discussed \u2013 and until then , sanctions and other mechanisms of political pressure will be applied to Tehran .\nIn other words \u2013 Biden \u2019 s policy is exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration .\nDesire to Overturn \u201c Trump \u2019 s Policy \u201d an Admission it was the Wrong Policy Biden \u2019 s apparent desire to return to the table with Iran is in itself an admission that the Trump administration \u2019 s decision to leave the deal was a mistake .\nThe US \u2013 as self-proclaimed leader of the international community \u2013 would be expected to demonstrate good leadership by not only admitting to its mistakes , but assuming responsibility for them \u2013 returning to the Iran Nuclear Deal unconditionally and approaching

.\nIt was the US \u2013 not Iran \u2013 who unilaterally withdrew from the deal , breaking its conditions and endangering the deal \u2019 s future .\nIran would be remiss if it returned to the negotiation table in full compliance to the deal , with no leverage , and sitting across from the US who has so far acted in bad faith at every critical juncture throughout previous negotiations

rather corporate-funded policy think tanks chaired by special interests who transcend US elections .\nIt is worth repeating that a 2009 policy paper produced by the corporate-financier funded Brookings Institution titled , \u201c Which Path to Persia ?\nOptions for a New American Strategy toward Iran , \u201d detailed plans to lure Iran in with a deal related to its nuclear technology , accuse Iran of rejecting it , and thus serving as a pretext for further US aggression up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military force .\nThe paper then laid out how the US could appear to the world as a peacemaker and depict Iran \u2019 s betrayal of a \u201c very good deal \u201d as the pretext for an otherwise reluctant US military response ( emphasis added ) : In 2009 when these words were originally published it might have been difficult to imagine just how literally and overtly the US would attempt to execute this ploy against Tehran .\nYet in hindsight it is clear that the administration of US President Barack Obama ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered this deal to Iran with full knowledge it would be betrayed in the near future \u2013 and was under Trump \u2013 with attempts to sabotage the deal further clearly underway by the Biden administration .\nWhile the Biden administration repeatedly claims it wants to return to the deal , it has created conditions it knows Iran will never accept while simultaneously carrying out a series of provocative military strikes across the Middle East against militias backed by Iran combating dangerous extremism within the borders of Iran \u2019 s closest regional allies .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s role as provocateur \u2013 nominating Israel to carry out strikes on Iranian targets in the hopes of provoking an Iranian retaliation the US could use as a pretext for wider war .\nWe can see the US and Israel both engaged in attempts to escalate towards just such a scenario .\nWhile occupants in the White House have changed three times now \u2013 a singular , belligerent US policy towards Iran \u2013 as laid out by the Brookings Institution \u2019 s 2009 paper \u2013 has remained unchanged and faithfully pursued for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now teeters upon a dangerous inflection point where the US finds itself out of excuses to delay returning to the deal and the window closing to \u201c credibly \u201d blame Iran for the deal \u2019 s failure .\nThe political momentum of Washington \u2019 s accusations will fade fast and require expedient provocations to see this policy through to its end \u2013 or risk missing an opportune pretext for war

distinguishing itself from the tactics , strategies , and agendas of the US and its regional allies .\nIt must do all of this while also sustaining its economy under the extreme pressure of US sanctions and with the absolute necessity to ultimately address Iran \u2019 s national security against obvious threats within and along its borders .\nAnother important point to make when describing the negotiation table and the context it sits within \u2013 is the fact that US forces illegally occupy nations to the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as one of Iran \u2019 s closest regional allies \u2013 Syria .\nUS expectations that Iran obediently return to the table in full compliance to the original Nuclear Deal \u2013 across from the very nation responsible for its near total collapse \u2013 and a nation whose military \u2013 thousands of miles from its own shores occupies nations on either side of Iran \u2019 s borders \u2013 are not reasonable .\nThat the Western media \u2013 a reflection

could be as high as 50 % .\nPentagon records show that there are approximately 2.2 million US military service members operating worldwide .\nIncredibly , CNN has attempted to spin the vaccine issue as a \u2018 national security crisis \u2019 \u2013 claiming that soldiers opting out of the jab \u2018 may affect force readiness , \u2019 and citing highly dubious \u2018 high-profile Covid outbreaks \u2019 which made headlines last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of actual casualties .\nClearly this is an attempt by CNN ( who receives millions per year in ad revenue from pharmaceutical companies ) to try and apply addition media and political pressure on military brass in order to enforce vaccine compliance in its ranks : In this case , CNN appears to be targeting the US military , in coordination with the Biden Administration \u2013 in running a nudging campaign which is trying to re-shape policy within the US military .\nAt the very end of its report , CNN gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coercive campaign being waged by Biden and allied politicians ( backed by a pharmaceutical lobby which spends hundreds of millions per year ) to try and remove soldiers \u2019 constitutional right of Informed Consent , openly admitting that the end goal of President Biden is to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for all military personnel : It should be noted that the current range of experimental corporate vaccine products for Covid-19 are not fully licensed products \u2013 allowed to bypass all of the normal research , safety and testing protocol under the cover of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposedly issued because government claims the pandemic was too deadly and \u2018 too many lives were at stake \u2019 to wait for a properly developed and fully tested Covid vaccine .\nNormally , a proper vaccine would take anything from 5 to 10 years to develop , but the current batch of experimental pharmaceutical jabs has been churned-out in only 9 months \u2013 leaving many to question to the broad claims

our coverage of the trial and watch inside the courtroom at Chauvin Trial LIVE blog .\n( MINNEAPOLIS , MN ) \u2013 Closing arguments in State of Minnesota vs. Derek Chauvin begin on Monday morning , after three weeks of witness testimony and cross-examination .\nAs expected , medical evidence explaining the cause of George Floyd \u2019 s death was the main focus of both cases presented to the jury .\nJurors will hear closing arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense , and then will immediately begin deliberations and be sequestered until they can decide on the charges applying the instructions given to them by the court .\nJudge Peter Cahill told jurors on Thursday shortly after both sides rested their case , \u2018 pack a bag for long , but hope for a short deliberation.\n\u2019 The jury could find Chauvin guilty of some of the charges , but acquit him of the others .\nOr , he could be found guilty or acquitted of all the charges .\nMany legal scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have from day one talked about the state \u2019 s \u2018 over-charging \u2019 problem in the Chauvin case .\nWhat effect will this potential misstep mean for the outcome of this trial when the jury begins deliberation and ultimately renders its verdict ?\nIMAGE : Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison ( pictured above standing ) , the state \u2019 s top cop , pushed hard to get the 3rd degree murder charge re-instated and also promised back in June of 2020 to \u2018 get justice \u2019 for George Floyd .\nHere are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statutes that the jury must decide on : For the 2nd degree murder charge to stick , jurors will need to also decide on the 3rd degree felony assault charge , as the charges are linked : While these charges against Chauvin do not explicitly have \u2018 intent \u2019 attached to them , throughout the trial the state has inferred it numerous times \u2013 calling multiple \u2019 emotionally harmed \u2019 bystander witnesses , use-of-force experts , and even members of the Minneapolis Police Department , including Chief Medaria Arradondo , to testify that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been shortened , but he chose to prolong it .\nThis could persuade some jurors to let their pre-conceived \u2018 motivations be the master of their reason \u2019 \u2013 as referenced here by constitutional attorney Robert Barnes \u2013 instead of following the jury instructions and the law as given to them : The state must still prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Chauvin caused Floyd \u2019 s death while committing a 3rd degree felony assault , inflicting \u201c substantial bodily harm.\n\u201d Many trial watchers lauded the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Martin Tobin , a pulmonologist and critical care specialist based in Illinois .\nIMAGE : Dr. Martin Tobin for the state .\nTobin \u2019 s testimony attempted to knock down any doubt that Floyd \u2019 s primary cause of death was from low oxygen levels due to Chauvin \u2019 s kneeling on him .\nThe 3rd degree murder charge has been highly contentious .\nIt was added in 2020 when Chauvin was first charged in the death of George Floyd , but Judge Cahill would later dismiss it .\nIt then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the court .\nIt was subsequently re-instated onto the charges when the state made its opening arguments to the jury .\nSection ( a ) of this statute is what the jury must decide on : This charge could be a real head-scratcher for the jury and they could get deadlocked on it .\nTo convict Chauvin of 3rd degree murder , the state must convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Chauvin \u2019 s acts were \u201c eminently dangerous to others.\n\u201d 21WIRE has posited all along that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most notably the bystander testimony , was mainly intended to create a theory of \u2018 danger \u2019 lurking outside of the Cup Foods location to try to make the 3rd degree murder charge stick to Chauvin .\nSidebar : Note under section ( b ) of the statute which has to do with distributing a \u201c controlled substance.\n\u201d Jurors are likely to be instructed as to why Morries Hall , Floyd \u2019 s other passenger in his vehicle on they day of the incident , did not testify .\nHall was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something away \u2019 at the scene .\nFloyd \u2019 s ex-girlfriend also testified that Hall was Floyd \u2019 s drug dealer .\nHall would later invoke his 5th amendment right not to testify .\nHall \u2019 s attorney was successful in getting the subpoena to testify quashed on the basis that it opened him up to a 3rd degree murder charge for killing Floyd with his drug supply .\nIMAGE : Police body cam footage shown to the jury by the defense in court , depicting Chauvin resting his knee on what appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , not his neck .\nThe 2nd degree manslaughter charge , of all the charges , appears to most \u2018 fit like a glove \u2019 for the jury .\nAll of this , of course , will come down to cause of death for the jury .\nDid the state meet its \u2018 burden of proof \u2019 and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Chauvin \u2019 s actions \u2018 substantially \u2019 caused Floyd \u2019 s death ?\nThe state provided two solid weeks of use-of-force and medical expert testimony to the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude that Chauvin restrained Floyd for far too long , and in some cases even outright condemned the type of restraint Chauvin used on Floyd entirely as outside the bounds of what a reasonable police officer would do based on their training .\nThe state repeatedly played the video footage from every possible angle showing how Floyd ultimately succumbed to Chauvin \u2019 s \u2018 knee on the neck \u2019 and deprived him of the oxygen he needed to stay alive .\nThis was both expected and proved to be the most effective part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , through its witnesses , the state also appeared to be telling the jury to disregard Floyd \u2019 s perilous health condition at the time of the arrest .\nThe defense attempted to introduce doubt at every turn \u2010 leaning heavily on the medical evidence , interrogating it during cross-examination of Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner , Dr. Andrew Baker , who performed the autopsy on Floyd and weighed-in on the toxicology report ; and later during its own case with the testimony of former Chief Medical Examiner for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fowler .\nFowler testified that Floyd had died from a \u201c sudden cardiac arrhythmia due to his atherosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease \u201d during his restraint by Chauvin and the other police officers .\nIn addition to this primary cause , Folwer also said that Floyd had other , multiple contributing factors as evidenced from the toxicology report \u2010 including the presence of fentanyl , methamphetamines .\nHe also suggested Floyd could have been exposed to carbon monoxide ( CO ) poisoning from the squad car exhaust .\nWhat to expect from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry Blackwell will give the state \u2019 s closing arguments .\nBlackwell is the founding partner , CEO and chairman of Blackwell Burke P.A .\nHe is also founder of the Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers .\nHe was not involved in questioning potential jurors and delivered state \u2019 s opening arguments .\nBlackwell had a few key moments during direct and cross-examination where he successfully threw the occasional legal \u2018 haymaker \u2019 at the defense through his questioning of witnesses .\nBlackwell is expected to make the state \u2019 s argument for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it substantially caused George Floyd \u2019 s death beyond a reasonable doubt .\nBlackwell is likely to also play more of the \u2018 knee on the neck \u2019 video for dramatic effect , and cite unreasonable use-of-force , and other medical testimony as evidence .\nJurors have no doubt been through a mind field of medical terminology haystacks during this trial , so also expect Blackwell to conclude on an emotional note as the state asks for a guilty verdict .\nWhat to expect from the defense \u2019 s closing arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the defense \u2019 s closing arguments .\nNelson is managing partner at Halberg Criminal Defense , and also works with a team of attorneys at Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association \u2013 the organization that is funding Chauvin \u2019 s defense .\nHe led the jury selection process , delivered opening arguments , and has been the face of Chauvin \u2019 s defense from the very beginning .\nNelson spent a consderable amount of time during jury selection getting to know jurors during the voir dire process .\nIf he met any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a \u2018 cocktail party \u2019 , it \u2019 s fair to say he would know something about each of them .\nNelson is expected to argue that there \u2019 s an abundance of reasonable doubt for the jury to consider with the state \u2019 s theory of how George Floyd died on May 25th , 2020 .\nHe \u2019 ll lay out for the jury all the contributing factors that caused Floyd \u2019 s death , including the cardio-pulmonary events , drug toxicity , possible CO poisoning \u2013 not substantially and singularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another key theme to look out for during Nelson \u2019 s closing argument is doubt surrounding whether Chauvin actually had his knee on Floyd \u2019 s neck .\nThroughout the trial , Nelson appeared to be putting together a \u2018 If the KNEE doesn \u2019 t fit , you must acquit \u2019 argument as multiple witnesses , mainly those brought by the state , testified that not only was Chauvin \u2019 s knee not on the neck of Floyd , but there was little to no evidence of injuries to his neck area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his closing : \u2022 Crowd not in danger and hostile to responding officers \u2022 Police followed arrest protocols , called for EMS at scene \u2022 CO levels in Floyd \u2019 s blood not disclosed in evidentiary discovery \u2022 Morries Hall did not testify , invoking the 5th with possible murder charge hanging over him \u2022 May 2019 arrest video shows pattern of Floyd \u2019 s behavior , including swallowing narcotics and demeanor when confronted by police \u2022 No witness testimony of principal officers involved : Lane , Keung , Thou or Chauvin .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpredictable .\nThis jury will have its instructions and the law to follow , but how they apply the instructions and interpret the law as it relates to the evidence in this case is an entirely different thing once deliberation begins .\nThe 2nd degree manslaughter charge could in fact \u2018 fit like a glove \u2019 for the jury enough to reach a unanimous decision .\nThe state may have met its burden of proof in the minds of the jury here .\nThe only chance Nelson may have to overcome this prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing statement imaginable , and Blackwell delivers a poor closing statement .\n21WIRE has maintained from the beginning of this trial that the state has over-charged Chauvin and murder charges against Chauvin will not stick .\nThe jury is likely to acquit him or be deadlocked on these higher charges .\nThe punishment phase of this trial , for the American public , will begin shortly after the jury reads its verdict .\nMobs are standing by , at-the-ready , to be stoked in large part by Team Crump \u2019 s response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,

Requirement", "content": "A recent post to Princeton University \u2019 s Instagram account informing students they will be required to be vaccinated for COVID-19 to attend the 2021-22 academic year .\nAs U.S. universities begin to wind down the spring academic term , many have forced students to get vaccinated .\nNow , one Ivy League institution , Princeton University , has forged ahead with its aggressive plan to require all students planning to attend this fall to get the COVID-19 jab .\nHooman Noorchashm MD , PhD , a physician-scientist based in Pennsylvania , has published this important open letter to Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warning him this \u201c mandated indiscriminate vaccination \u201d requirement is potentially dangerous and could cause harm to some members of the student body : I am writing you after learning from an Instagram posting that : \u201c Princeton will require all undergraduate and graduate students to receive COVID-19 vaccines for the 2021\u20132022 academic year \u201d .\nI am writing you urgently on the public record to warn Princeton University of the danger of harm this blanket requirement will almost certainly impose on , at least , some members of your student body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after you , your healthcare advisors and your risk managers read this public letter of warning with care , you will elect to revise this dangerous course of action to safer space .\nSpecifically , I am writing here as a physician and immunologist to inform you of my very serious concern that indiscriminate COVID-19 vaccination of members of the Princeton University community , who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 or who are naturally immune , poses a risk of harm to some such persons .\nI am compelled to communicate this urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your University \u2019 s indiscriminate COVID-19 vaccine policy is almost certain to pose a risk of serious or potentially deadly , but totally avoidable , harm to some in your midst .\nI am sure you recognize that somewhere upwards of 20\u201330 % of your community ( and the American population on the whole ) has already been naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 and the vast majority of such persons are very likely to be well immune to the virus .\nBy Fall semester of 2021 , the percentages of the naturally infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been discussing the serious safety concern in indiscriminately vaccinating college students ( and other persons ) , who were recently infected and are naturally immune , with a few concerned parents and friends at other Universities that have , so far , publicly announced a COVID-19 vaccine \u201c mandate \u201d \u2014 including Boston University , University of Notre Dame , Fordham University , Syracuse University and Rutgers University , among others .\nIn support of these families , I have sent public letters to the leadership of these institutions warning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indiscriminate vaccine mandate .\nPlease read these letters at the below links HERE , HERE , HERE , HERE and HERE .\nAdditionally , I am in contact with Dr. Janet Woodcock and her team at FDA and recently generated THIS public letter to the agency for their record and consideration .\nIn short , it is my opinion as a physician , immunologist and public health advocate that vaccinating persons who are recently infected , or who are naturally immune to SARS-CoV-2 , poses a risk of harm to such persons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a material risk and the second is a highly likely , but immunologically prognosticated risk : 1 ) because vaccination of naturally immune persons is , by definition , an unnecessary medical procedure , all persons so treated are unreasonably exposed to the general risks associated with that procedure/treatment .\nIn the case of vaccines , these include allergic reactions , anaphylaxis and Guillain Barre Syndrome , ( and in the case of the COVID-19 vaccine , the blood clots that seem to be an added risk ) , all of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mortality \u2014 no matter if this risk is to only a \u201c minority subset \u201d of those vaccinated , it is nonetheless unreasonable to expose naturally immune persons to these risks , because the treatment is medically unnecessary and unlikely to benefit such persons .\nCertainly , because we do not know who exactly in this category of persons is at risk of harm , the risk exposure is to every naturally infected person treated as such .\nTherefore , it is absolutely critical to only treat ( or mandate vaccination in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necessary medical treatment : That is , those who are NOT already immune to the SARS-CoV-2 virus .\n2 ) recently , or asymptomatically , infected persons are very highly likely to be at risk of an exacerbated and dangerous hyper-inflammatory immune responses when indiscriminately vaccinated \u2014 several cases of this complication in the recently infected and vaccinated have emerged over the past few weeks across the nation , including the deaths of Dr. J. Barton Williams of Memphis , TN and Mr. Christopher Sarmiento of Las Cruces , NM .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their vaccine triggered complications are unlikely to be isolated ones .\nIt is a near certainty that at least some members of your community at Princeton , with recent or asymptomatic infections , will be at a similar risk of serious or life-threatening complications following indiscriminate vaccination .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

like this man celebrating the 4th of July holiday , can enjoy a free and healthy lifestyle in the Sunshine State .\nOne of the biggest misconceptions and fake news talking points about how Florida and

\u2019 ( or \u2018 Covidiot \u2019 ) conspiracy theory \u2013 claiming that Governors like Ron DeSantis unilaterally made these public health policy decisions in a vacuum .\nWe now know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rare , intellectually sober health officials in these states , that the reality is something far different .\nFlorida has protected the dignity and well-being of its oldest residents , all while taking constant incoming from the medical media complex , and yet has prospered as a \u2018 free state \u2019 in the age of Covid .\nIn his most recent column for the Irish media outlet Gript , writer Thade Andy take us inside Florida \u2019 s state health agency \u2013 its leadership , and its successful triage strategy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the state .\nHow is it that the state of Florida , a state run by a Republican Governor who has rejected wholesale the lockdown wisdom , has had such success in reducing Covid numbers ?\nHow is it that the same state , known as the retirement home of America , has been one of the most successful states in America in protecting its elderly citizens ?\nHow did they do all this while Governor , Ron DeSantis , kept the state open for business despite the protests of the zero-covid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over 22 million people , has counties with dense urban populations , and has a senior population ( over 65 years of age ) of 4.4 million , with 3 million over 70 .\nIt has roughly 4,000 elderly care homes and roughly 155,000 residents of these homes .\nFlorida has suffered 1,616 deaths per million of population , placing it in the bottom ( better ) half of states in the U.S. for this statistic .\nThe average is 1,765 .\nApproximately 1 in 5 of its residents are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how did Florida stay open and not have a catastrophic level of deaths amongst its elderly ?\nThe answer is in the dedication to evidence-based policy that the leaders of Florida determined to pursue from the very outset of the Covid pandemic .\nAs it materialised that that Covid was a global pandemic , the Governor of Florida , Ron DeSantis , looked at what the death tolls were telling us .\nWhen early data became available from South Korea , DeSantis said they looked carefully at the fine details of who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That analysis ( which any policy maker anywhere could have made , as they had access to the same information ) showed that this was an illness that almost exclusively struck hard at the elderly .\nAs early as May 2020 , DeSantis was able to report on how his state had assessed and responded to this risk .\n\u201c I just thought it was so dramatic , the extent to which this was concentrated in the older age groups .\nI think the first real fresh set of South Korea numbers I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fatalities under 30 , and then 80 percent of them were 70 and above or something like that .\nIt was really , really dramatic.\n\u201d Italy also provided early data , but while the rest of the world took Italy as a dire precursor to their own future , DeSantis \u2019 s team did a granular study of the statistics .\nAgain they learned that the elderly ( with a median age of 82 ) took the brunt of casualties , but more crucially they learned that this was the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could successfully focus protection on this vulnerable group .\nSo while other leaders were spreading resources too thin , in Florida the number one priority was elderly care homes and retirement villages .\nPPE resources were put first into care homes .\nThis was where the vulnerable population was so it was prioritised above hospitals .\nAs De Santis rightly recognised , \u201c If I can send PPE to the nursing homes , and they can prevent an outbreak there , that \u2019 s going to do more to lower the burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-wide system of active management to ensure the strictest guidelines were implemented in care homes .\nThis required all staff and any worker that entered to be screened for COVID symptoms including temperature checks .\nAnybody who exhibited any symptoms would just simply not be allowed to go in .\nIn the hospitals , care was taken not to discharge the elderly back into care homes prematurely .\nDe Santis \u2019 s team were insistent that they be kept in hospital until all risk of Covid contagion had passed .\nThis might seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all over the world Covid contagious patients were being returned to care homes because people were panicking that the hospitals would be overrun .\nThat reactionary decision proved disastrously fatal for elderly care residents all over the world , but not so in Florida .\nPushing these policies on a day to day basis was Mary Mayhew , secretary of Florida \u2019 s Agency for Healthcare Administration .\nHer job included daily calls with the hospitals to manage this situation as she was acutely aware of the pressure to release elderly Covid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Mayhew , secretary of Florida \u2019 s Agency for

"21stcenturywire", "title": "Washington\u2019s Commitment to Seeking Conflict in South China Sea", "content": "Despite hopes by some that with Joe Biden a new US foreign policy will follow \u2013 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reaffirmed Washington \u2019 s commitment to seeking conflict in the South China Sea under the guise of \u201c standing with Southeast Asian claimants.\n\u201d Reuters in their article , \u201c US stands with SE Asian countries against China pressure , Blinken says \u201d would claim : Secretary Blinken pledged to stand with Southeast Asian claimants in the face of PRC pressure , \u201d it said , referring to the People \u2019 s Republic of China .\nChina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China Sea , which is also a major trade route .\nThe Philippines , Brunei , Vietnam , Malaysia and Taiwan have overlapping claims .\nThe United States has accused China of taking advantage of the distraction of the coronavirus pandemic to advance its presence in the South China Sea .\nThe US announcement confirms that a confrontational posture toward China will continue regardless of who occupies the White House \u2013 as US tensions with China are rooted in unelected Western special interests and their desire to remove China as a competitor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves call \u201c US primacy in Asia.\n\u201d One such paper titled , \u201c Revising US Grand Strategy Toward China , \u201d published by the Council on Foreign Relations in 2015 not only spelled out the US desire to maintain that primacy in Asia vis-a-vis China , but also how it would use overlapping claims in the South China Sea as a pretext to justify a continued \u2013 or even expanded military presence in the region and as a common cause to pressure China \u2019 s neighbors into a united front against Beijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals of militarizing Southeast Asia and integrating the region into a common US-led defense architecture against China .\nIt is a policy built upon the US \u201c pivot to Asia \u201d unveiled as early as 2011 and a policy that has been built upon in turn during the last four years under the Trump administration \u2013 demonstrating the continuity of agenda that permeates US foreign policy .\nMaritime disputes are common throughout the world \u2013 even in the West .\nJust at the end of last year , the Guardian in an article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help protect fishing waters in case of no-deal Brexit , \u201d would report : In terms of such disputes , the waters of the South China Sea are no exception .\nNot only does China have overlapping claims with the nations mentioned in the Reuters article \u2013 each nation listed has overlapping claims with one another .\nThis results in sporadic disputes between all of these nations \u2013 occasionally resulting in the seizing of vessels and the temporary detaining of boat crews .\nHowever \u2013 these disputes are regularly settled through bilateral methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and China itself .\nA high-profile example of this unfolded in 2015 where a US-led legal case was brought to the Hague on behalf of the Philippines regarding Chinese claims over the South China Sea .\nWhile the Hague ruled in the Philippines \u2019 favor \u2013 Manila declined to use the ruling as leverage against Beijing or to seek Washington \u2019 s assistance \u2013 and instead pursued bilateral talks with Beijing directly on its own .\nIt is a case that demonstrates the desire by Washington to escalate what are ordinary maritime disputes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis \u2013 not unlike the US \u2019 strategy in the Middle East which it uses to justify its perpetual military occupation there .\nMore recently the issue of the South China Sea has come up at ASEAN Summits .\nAl Jazeera in its article , \u201c ASEAN summit : South China Sea , coronavirus pandemic cast a shadow , \u201d would cite Malaysia \u2019 s take on the issue , noting : While the US poses a champion for Southeast Asia \u2013 it is clear that its efforts are unwelcome and viewed instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a path toward resolution .\nIt is almost certain that it is Washington the Malaysian foreign minister was referring to when he mentioned \u201c other powers.\n\u201d Just as the US nominated itself as protector of European \u201c energy security \u201d in its bid to obstruct the Russian-German Nord Stream 2 pipeline \u2013 the US has inserted itself into relatively routine maritime disputes in the South China Sea \u2013 not to \u201c stand with \u201d the nations of the region , but to serve as an excuse to impose its \u201c primacy \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia count China among their largest trade partners , sources of tourism , and for several \u2013 a key military and infrastructure partner .\nThe prospect of a regionally destabilizing conflict originating over long-standing disputes in the South China Sea benefits no one actually located in Asia \u2013 and only serves the interests of those beyond Asia seeking to divide and reassert their rule over it .\n*** Author Tony Cartalucci , Bangkok-based geopolitical researcher , writer and special contributor to 21st Century Wire .\nSee more of his work at Tony \u2019 @ @ @ @ @

Officially Recommending COVID Jabs for Pregnant Women?", "content": "The beyond conflicted U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has struck again : Pregnant women are now urged to get the COVID-19 gene manipulation jab , based on preliminary findings .\nThe postmarketing surveillance data , published in The New England Journal of Medicine,1 found \u201c no obvious safety signals \u201d among the 35,691 pregnant women who got either the Moderna or Pfizer shots between December 14 , 2020 , and February 28 , 2021 .\nThe women ranged in age from 16 to 54 years old .\nCDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky issued a statement saying:2 There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this green-lighting for pregnant women .\nFirst of all , as noted by Jeremy Hammond in a recent Tweet:3 The authors themselves state that data on mRNA \u201c vaccines \u201d in pregnancy are limited , and that without longitudinal follow-up of large numbers of women , it \u2019 s not possible to determine \u201c maternal , pregnancy and infant outcomes.\n\u201d 4 Secondly , all postmarketing surveillance data are preliminary , so it seems incredibly foolhardy to make a blanket recommendation for all pregnant women at this early stage .\nThirdly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-reporting to one of two sources : \u2022 The Vaccine Safe ( V-Safe ) After Vaccination Health Checker program , a vaccine safety registry set up specifically for the monitoring of COVID-19 \u201c vaccine \u201d side effects By using voluntary self-reporting , we have no way of knowing how many side effects have gone unreported and can not confirm that the data present an accurate picture .\nHistorically , we know that voluntary reporting of vaccine side effects range from less than 1 % 6,7 to a maximum of 10 % ,8 so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not getting the full story .\nA hint that an enormous amount of data concerning pregnancy outcomes are being overlooked or hidden can be discerned by the fact that the paper only looked at 11 % of the total number of pregnancies reported to V-Safe .\nWhile they state that a total of 35,691 pregnant women were included in the analysis , they actually only looked at 3,958 of them .\nHere \u2019 s how the paper reads:9 If there were 35,691 pregnant V-Safe participants , why are they looking at just 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlicensed COVID-19 gene therapies is reprehensibly irresponsible experimental medicine , and to suggest that safety data are \u201c piling up \u201d is pure propaganda .\nEverything is still in the experimental stage and all data are preliminary .\nIt \u2019 ll take years to get a clearer picture of how these injections are affecting young women and their babies .\nPregnancy is a time during which experimentation is extremely hazardous , as you \u2019 re not only dealing with potential repercussions for the mother but also for the child .\nAny number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs , chemicals or foreign substances during fetal development .\nThe CDC has absolutely no way of gauging safety for pregnant women and babies as of yet , so to do so is reprehensible beyond words , in my opinion \u2014 especially seeing how women of childbearing age have virtually no risk of dying from COVID-19 , their fatality risk being a mere 0.01 % .10 Contrast this to the potential benefits of the vaccine .\nYou can still contract the virus if immunized and you can still spread it to others.11,12,13,14 All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your symptoms if or when you get infected .\nPregnant women simply do not need this vaccine , and therefore any risk is likely excessive .\nI have little doubt we \u2019 ll end up with a second Nuremberg Trial over this at some point in the future .\nGetting back to the NEJM study , the authors report the following findings , based on data collected from VAERS and V-Safe:15 So , in VAERS , the miscarriage rate was 20.8 % ( 46 of 221 reports ) , and in V-Safe ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants ) , the miscarriage rate was 13.9 % ( 115 of 827 ) .\nAgain , these data were reported between December 14 , 2020 , and February 28 , 2021 .\nThe combined miscarriage and preterm birth rate , per V-Safe , was 23.3 % ( 13.9 % + 9.4 % ) .\nAs of April 1 , 2021 , 379 VAERS reports16 had been filed by pregnant women , 110 of which involved miscarriage or premature birth , giving us an updated rate of 29 % .\nIn other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and premature births is rising as more reports come in .\nAccording to the authors of the NEJM report , these ratios are comparable to the miscarriage rate normally seen among unvaccinated women , while admitting that the data is \u201c not directly comparable.\n\u201d I find that dubious , seeing how sources17 reviewing statistical data stress that the risk of miscarriage drops from an overall , average risk rate of 21.3 % for the duration of the pregnancy as a whole , to just 5 % between Weeks 6 and 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Weeks 14 and 20 .\nAnd , while the NEJM study18 report that 92.3 % of spontaneous abortions occurred before 13 weeks of gestation , it specifies that very little is as yet known about the effects of the injections when given to women during the periconception period and the first and second trimesters , as \u201c limited follow-up calls had been made at the time of this analysis.\n\u201d Now , if the miscarriage rate is normally 5 % and declining after Week 6 , then miscarriage rates of 13.9 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Week 13 is clearly excessive .\nAs for the preterm birth rate , 9.4 % does appear relatively \u201c normal \u201d based on historical data , which in 2019 ranged from 7.28 % to 18.8 % depending on the region , with an average right around 10 % .19 Time will tell whether that percentage will remain within the norms as the outcomes of pregnant women are entered into databases .\nIf preterm birth rates do rise above the norm , then that too is a significant public health issue , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous , averaging at $ 26.2 billion annually , as is.20 The featured video at the top of this article is the recording of a public comment by Janci Chunn Lindsay , Ph.D. , director of toxicology and molecular biology for Toxicology Support Services LLC , given to the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) , April 23 , 2021 .\nLindsay \u2019 s expertise is analysis of pharmacological dose-responses , mechanistic biology and complex toxicity dynamics .\nIn her comment , Lindsay describes how she aided the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sterility in animals which , despite careful pre-analysis , had not been predicted .\nShe calls for an immediate halt to COVID-19 mRNA and DNA vaccines due to safety concerns on multiple fronts .\nShe notes there is credible concern that they will cross-react with syncytin ( a retroviral envelope protein ) and reproductive genes in sperm , ova and placenta in ways that may \u201c impair fertility and reproductive outcomes.\n\u201d I \u2019 ve touched on this in previous articles , including \u201c How COVID-19 Is Changing the Future of Vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put Up Collateral for Lawsuits.\n\u201d Not a single study has disproven this hypothesis , Lindsey notes .\nAnother theory of how these injections might impair fertility can be found in a 2006 study,21 which showed sperm can take up foreign mRNA , convert it into DNA , and release it as little pellets ( plasmids ) in the medium around the fertilized egg .\nThe embryo then takes up these plasmids and carries them ( sustains and clones them into many of the daughter cells ) throughout its life , even passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible that the pseudo-exosomes that are the mRNA contents would be perfect for supplying the sperm with mRNA for the spike protein .\nSo , potentially , a vaccinated woman who gets pregnant with an embryo that can ( via the sperms \u2019 plasmids ) synthesize the spike protein according to the instructions in the vaccine , would have an immune capacity to attack that embryo because of the \u201c foreign \u201d protein it displays on its cells .\nThis then would cause a miscarriage .\n\u201c We could potentially be sterilizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe fact that there have been live births following COVID-19 vaccination is not proof that these injections do not have a reproductive effect , she says .\nLindsay also points out that reports of menstrual irregularities and vaginal hemorrhaging in women who have received the injections number in the thousands,22,23,24 and this too hints at reproductive effects .\nI agree with her conclusion that we simply can not inject children and women of childbearing age with these experimental technologies until more rigorous studies have been done and we have a better understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there have been hundreds of reports of rare blood clotting disorders following all COVID-19 \u201c vaccines \u201d among people with no underlying risk factors , including immune thrombocytopenia25,26,27,28 ( ITP ) , a rare autoimmune disease that causes your immune system to destroy your platelets ( cells that help blood clot ) , resulting in hemorrhaging .\nSerious blood clots are also occurring at the same time .\nHere , she points out the obvious : COVID-19 has been found to cause blood clotting disorders due to the virus \u2019 unique spike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruct your body to make that very spike protein .\nWhy would one assume that this spike protein can not have similar effects when produced by your own cells ?\nOne hypothesis that has been presented is that platelet-antagonistic antibodies are being formed against the spike antigen.29 Another novel hypothesis30 is that the lipid-coated nanoparticles , which transport the mRNA , may be carrying that mRNA into the megakaryocytes in your bone marrow .\nMegakaryocytes are cells that produce platelets .\nAccording to this hypothesis , once the mRNA enters your bone marrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein , which would tag them for destruction by cytotoxic T-cells .\nAs your platelets are destroyed , thrombocytopenia sets in .\nWomen who have received the COVID-19 jab are also making what I believe is a huge mistake by sharing breast milk in a misguided effort to inoculate unvaccinated mothers \u2019 babies .\nAs reported by The New York Times:31 Again , there \u2019 s scarcely any data on what these gene therapies might do to infants , which is reason alone not to experiment .\nSo far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant dying has been attributed to breastfeeding .\nA 5-month-old infant died with a diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura within days of his mother receiving her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.35,36 But while fact checkers roundly dismiss the idea that the child could have developed thrombocytopenia from mRNA-contaminated breast milk,37 it \u2019 s important to realize they have no evidence for that .\nIt \u2019 s pure opinion .\nAs of right now , we have no idea how or why the infant developed this rare blood disorder , but it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing children can not be affected and that there is no risk at all .\nIn addition to that lethal case , there are at least 20 other cases where children have had an adverse reaction to breast milk from a vaccinated mother.38 At present , all we can confidently say is that short-term harmful effects of COVID-19 vaccines are being reported at a staggering rate , and that the long-term effects are completely unknown .\nIn addition to the more immediate effects already discussed , there are mechanisms by which COVID-19 \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to the wild virus , as detailed in \u201c How COVID-19 Vaccine Can Destroy Your Immune System , \u201d \u201c Will Vaccinated People Be More Vulnerable to Variants ?\n\u201d and several other articles .\nAs noted in a February 4 , 2021 , New England Journal of Medicine paper39 reporting on the safety and effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna , \u201c Whether mRNA-1273 vaccination results in enhanced disease on exposure to the virus in the long term is unknown.\n\u201d On the whole , injecting pregnant women with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systemic inflammation , cardiac effects and bleeding disorders ( among other things ) , violates both the Hippocratic Oath that admonishes doctors to \u201c First , do no harm , \u201d and the precautionary principle that , historically , has governed health care for pregnant women .\nIn my view , this mass experiment is a humanitarian crime .\nThat said , if you or someone you love \u2014 pregnant or not \u2014 has received a COVID-19 vaccine and are experiencing side effects , be sure to report it , preferably to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , it \u2019 s absolutely crucial that people report their experiences with these vaccines , so that we can start getting a clearer idea of what their effects are .\n\u2022 If you live in the U.S. , file a report on VAERS \u2022 Report the injury

Encirclement of China", "content": "Tensions between Washington and Beijing are not merely the recent results of former US President Donald Trump \u2019 s time in office \u2013 but rather just the latest chapter in US efforts to contain China that stretch back decades .\nIndeed , US foreign policy has for decades admittedly aimed at encircling and containing China \u2019 s rise and maintaining primacy over the Indo-Pacific region .\nThe \u201c Pentagon Papers \u201d leaked in 1969 would admit in regards to the ongoing US war against Vietnam that : The papers also admitted that China , \u201c looms as a major power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effectiveness in the world and , more remotely but more menacingly , to organize all of Asia against [ America ] .\nThe papers also made it clear that there were ( and still are ) , \u201c three fronts to a long-run effort to contain China : ( a ) the Japan-Korea front ; ( b ) the India-Pakistan front ; and ( c ) the Southeast Asia front.\n\u201d Since then , it is clear that from the continued US military presence in both Japan and South Korea , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both Pakistan \u2019 s and China \u2019 s borders , and the emergence of the so-called \u201c Milk Tea Alliance \u201d aimed at overthrowing Southeast Asian governments friendly with China and replacing them with US-backed client regimes \u2013 this policy to contain China endures up to today .\nAssessing US activity along these three fronts reveals the progress and setbacks Washington faces \u2013 and various dangers to global peace and stability Washington \u2019 s continued belligerence pose .\nMilitary.com in their article , \u201c Here \u2019 s What It Costs to Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d reports : The article notes that according to the US Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , the US spent \u201c $ 34 billion to maintain military presences in Japan and South Korea between 2016 and 2019.\n\u201d The article cites the GAO providing an explanation as to why this massive US military presence is maintained in East Asia : \u201c Alliances \u201d that are \u201c strengthened \u201d by the physical presence of what are essentially occupying US forces suggests the \u201c alliance \u201d is hardly voluntary and claims of promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d is highly subjective \u2013 begging the question of to whom the Indo-Pacific is \u201c free and open \u201d to .\nAnd as US power wanes both regionally in the Indo-Pacific as well as globally , Washington has placed increasing pressure on both Japan and South Korea to not only help shoulder this financial burden , but to also become more proactive within Washington \u2019 s containment strategy toward China .\nJapan is one of three other nations ( the US itself , Australia , and India ) drafted into the US-led Quadrilateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Quad.\n\u201d Rather than the US solely depending on its own military forces based within Japanese territory or supported by its Japan-based forces , Japan \u2019 s military along with India \u2019 s and Australia \u2019 s are also being recruited to take part in military exercises and operations in and around the South China Sea .\nIndia \u2019 s inclusion in the Quad also fits well into the US 3-front strategy that made up Washington \u2019 s containment policy toward China as early as the 1960s .\nIn addition to recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US helps encourage escalation through political support and media campaigning of India \u2019 s various territorial disputes with China .\nThe US also targets Pakistan \u2019 s close and ongoing relationship with China \u2013 including the support of armed insurgents in Pakistan \u2019 s Baluchistan province .\nRecently , a bombing at a hotel in Quetta , Baluchistan appears to have targeted China \u2019 s ambassador to Pakistan , Ambassador Nong Rong .\nThe BBC in its article , \u201c Pakistan hotel bomb : Deadly blast hits luxury venue in Quetta , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s reporting is the extensive and open support the US government has provided these separatists over the years and how \u2013 clearly \u2013 this is more than just a local uprising against perceived injustice , but yet another example of armed conflict-by-proxy waged by Washington against China .\nAs far back as 2011 publications like The National Interest in articles like , \u201c Free Baluchistan \u201d would openly advocate expanding US support for separatism in Pakistan \u2019 s Baluchistan province .\nThe article was written by the late Selig Harrison \u2013 who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate-financier funded Center for International Policy \u2013 and would claim : Of course , \u201c Islamist forces \u201d is a euphemism for US-Persian Gulf state sponsored militants used to both fight Western proxy wars as well as serve as a pretext for Western intervention .\nCiting \u201c Islamist forces \u201d in Baluchistan , Pakistan clearly serves as an example of the latter .\nIn addition to op-eds published by influential policy think tanks , US legislators like US Representative Dana Rohrabacher had proposed resolutions such as ( emphasis added ) , \u201c US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 112th ) : Expressing the sense of Congress that the people of Baluchistan , currently divided between Pakistan , Iran , and Afghanistan , have the right to self-determination and to their own sovereign country.\n\u201d There is also funding provided to adjacent , political groups supporting separatism in Baluchistan , Pakistan as listed by the US government \u2019 s own National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) website under \u201c Pakistan.\n\u201d Organizations like the \u201c Association for Integrated Development Balochistan \u201d are funded by the US government and used to mobilize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US in Pakistan \u2019 s internal political affairs .\nThe Gwadar Port project is a key juncture within China \u2019 s growing global network of infrastructure projects as part of its One Belt , One Road initiative .\nThe US clearly opposes China \u2019 s rise and has articulated robust strategies to counter it ; everything up to and including open war as seen in the Pentagon Papers regarding the Vietnam War .\nThe recent bombing in Baluchistan , Pakistan demonstrates that this strategy continues in regards to utilizing local militants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the much wider , region-wide strategy of encircling and containing China .\nOf course the US war against Vietnam was part of a wider effort to reassert Western primacy over Southeast Asia and deny the region from fueling China \u2019 s inevitable rise .\nThe US having lost the war and almost completely retreating from the Southeast Asia region saw Southeast Asia itself repair relations amongst themselves and with China .\nToday , the nations of Southeast Asia count China as their largest trade partner , investor , a key partner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region \u2019 s armed forces , as well as providing the majority of tourism arrivals throughout the region .\nFor countries like Thailand , more tourists arrive from China than from all Western nations combined .\nBecause existing governments in Southeast Asia have nothing to benefit from by participating in American belligerence toward China , the US has found it necessary to cultivate and attempt to install into power various client regimes .\nThis has been an ongoing process since the Vietnam War .\nThe US has targeted each nation individually for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US-backed opposition leader-in-exile Thaksin Shinawatra deployed his \u201c red shirt \u201d protesters in back-to-back riots \u2013 the latter of which included some 300 armed militants and culminated in city-wide arson across Bangkok and the death of over 90 police , soldiers , protesters , and bystanders .\nIn 2018 , US-backed opposition groups took power in Malaysia after the US poured millions of dollars for over a decade in building up the opposition .\nHe would elaborate on how the NED \u2019 s network played a direct role in placing US-backed opposition figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stating : [ Malaysia ] is not a hugely pro-American country .\nIt \u2019 s probably never going to be an actual US ally , but this is going to redound to our benefit , and and that \u2019 s an example of the long game .\nIt is a pattern that has repeated itself in Myanmar over the decades with NED money building a parallel political system within the nation and eventually leading to Aung San Suu Kyi and her US-backed National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party taking power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extensive is US backing for opposition groups there that elections virtually guarantee US-backed candidates win every single time .\nThe US National Endowment for Democracy \u2019 s own website alone lists over 80 programs and organizations receiving US government money for everything from election polling and building up political parties , to funding media networks and \u201c environmental \u201d groups used to block Chinese-initiated infrastructure projects The move by Myanmar \u2019 s military in February this year , ousting Aung Sang Suu Kyi and the NLD was meant to correct this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups protesting in the streets , the US has \u2013 for many decades \u2013 backed and armed ethnic rebels across the country .\nThese rebels have now linked up with the US-backed NLD and are repeating US-backed regime change tactics used against the Arab World in 2011 in nations like Libya , Yemen , and Syria \u2013 including explicit calls for \u201c international intervention.\n\u201d Watch the following clip from CSIS panel discussion where DC policy operatives admit how the US use \u2018 democracy promotion \u2019 front organizations like the NED and USAID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence over politics in key strategic countries like Malaysia : Just as the US did during the 2011 \u201c Arab Spring \u201d \u2013 the US State Department , in a bid to create synergies across various regime change campaigns in Asia , has introduced the \u201c Milk Tea Alliance \u201d to transform individual US-backed regime change efforts in Asia into a region-wide crisis .\nThe BBC itself admits in articles like , \u201c Milk Tea Alliance : Twitter creates emoji for pro-democracy activists , \u201d that : The alliance has brought together anti-Beijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-democracy campaigners in Thailand and Myanmar .\nOmitted from the BBC \u2019 s coverage of the \u201c Milk Tea Alliance \u201d ( intentionally ) is the actual common denominators that unite it \u2013 US funding through fronts like the National Endowment for Democracy and a unifying hatred of China based exclusively on talking points pushed by the US State Department itself .\nCircling back to the Pentagon Papers and recalling the coordinated , regional campaign the US sought to encircle China with \u2013 we can then look at more recent US government policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in the White House archives from the Trump administration .\nThe paper also discusses information campaigns designed to \u201c educate \u201d the world about \u201c China \u2019 s coercive behaviour and influence operations around the globe.\n\u201d These campaigns have materialized in a propaganda war fabricating accusations of \u201c Chinese genocide \u201d in Xinjiang , China , claims that Chinese telecom company Huawei is a global security threat , and that China \u2013 not the US \u2013 is the single largest threat to global peace and stability today .\nIn reality US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Washington \u2019 s desire to continue its own decades-long impunity upon the global stage and the continuation of all the wars , humanitarian crises , and abuses that have stemmed from it .\nUnderstanding the full scope of Washington \u2019 s \u201c competition \u201d with China helps unlock the confusion surrounding unfolding individual crises like the trade war , the ongoing violence and turmoil in Myanmar , bombings in southwest Pakistan , students mobs in Thailand , riots in Hong Kong , and attempts by the US to transform the South China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these events are all connected \u2013 then assessing the success or failure of US efforts gives us a clearer picture of the overall success Washington in encircling China .\nIt also gives governments and regional blocs a

began exploring her divorce options nearly two years ago , at about the same time when notorious pedophile and sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein mysteriously died in his New York City jail cell , and as husband Bill \u2019 s peculiar relationship with Epstein was beginning to attract some attention .\nPhotograph taken at Jeffrey Epstein \u2019 s Manhattan mansion in 2011 shows from left : James E.

science adviser ( Image Credit : New York Times ) If mainstream media reportage , flight logs and court documents are anything to go by , then Epstein was able to ensnare a number of other top global luminaries into saucy jet-setting social network , including Prince Andrew , President Bill Clinton , Larry Summers , New Mexico governor Bill Richardson , and TV lawyer Alan Dershowitz .\nOthers names of note include Mick Jagger , Courtney Love , Peter Mandelson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more interesting when you add to it Microsoft and global vaccine mogul Bill Gates .\nTheir relationship raises a number of provocative questions .\nIs it possible that Gates was caught up in Epstein \u2019 s VIP sexual blackmail ring , or perhaps was Gates \u2019 involvement with Epstein much deeper and more profound ?\nRecently , Gates has publicly denied having any business relationship with Epstein , claiming \u201c I didn \u2019 t have any business relationship or friendship with him , \u201d and in a clever bit of misdirection Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any money to anything that I know about.\n\u201d However , this attempted denial appears to be a lie .\nIt has already been established that the convicted sex offender \u201c directed \u201d Gates to donate $ 2 million to the MIT Media Lab research project in October 2014 .\nIn 2019 , the New Yorker reported how MIT Media Lab attempted to conceal its working relationship with Epstein \u2013 an important line of inquiry which might bring some of the think tank \u2019 s shadowy projects under increased scrutiny .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Media Lab has been one of the key players in social engineering and the weaponization of applied behavorial psychology during the COVID crisis , as well as change agents promoting aggressive new climate change policies .\nFrom the beginning of the COVID crisis , Gates has been the most prominent and outspoken proponent for medieval-style lockdowns , mask mandates , business closures , experimental pharmaceutical drugs and mass-vaccinations , and the controversial Vaccine Passport bio surveillance scheme .\nGates also claims that , \u201c I didn \u2019 t go to New Mexico or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , \u201d but in fact there were other previously reported meetings between the two wealthy men , including one in New York in 2013 that preceded a ride to Palm Beach in one of Epstein \u2019 s private planes , along with Gates \u2019 former chief scientific adviser being named as alternate executor to Epstein \u2019 s will .\nEither way , it \u2019 s clear that Bill Gates is now running rear guard PR action \u2013 in order to insulate himself and his empire from any potential fallout from his dealings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up being one of the largest divorce settlements in history .\nMelinda French Gates had concerns about her husband \u2019 s dealings with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein when she consulted lawyers to explore the option of divorcing the Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates , according to reports .\nThe billionaire philanthropists announced their decision to divorce last week after declaring their marriage \u201c irretrievably broken \u201d \u2013 but did not explain why .\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that in 2019 Melinda , 56 , hired a team of lawyers from several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible divorce .\nThe Journal said several of its sources had said Melinda was concerned about her husband \u2019 s business dealings with Epstein , who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges related to sex trafficking .\nMelinda is said to have expressed unease at Bill \u2019 s relationship with Epstein since at least 2013 .\nHer meeting with divorce lawyers in October 2019 is said to have taken place at roughly the same time as a New York Times article detailed Bill \u2019 s meetings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Epstein \u2019 s New York mansion .\nThe article , which detailed Epstein \u2019 s connections with the rich and powerful , said none of them \u201c compared in prestige and power to the [ then ] world \u2019 s second-richest person , a brilliant and intensely private luminary : Bill Gates .\nAnd unlike many others , Mr Gates started the relationship after Mr Epstein was convicted of sex crimes.\n\u201d The Daily Beast reported that Melinda , who has recently introduced her maiden name , French , into her social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associating with Epstein in 2013 .\nThe website said Melinda was furious with Bill for meeting with the wealthy sex offender and it proved to be \u201c a turning point for the Gates \u2019 relationship \u201d .\nA spokesperson for Bill told the Journal the 65-year-old stood by a statement about Epstein given to the New York Times in 2019 .\nIn that statement he said : \u201c I met him .\nI didn \u2019 t have any business relationship or friendship with him .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t go to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of that .\nThere were people around him who were saying , \u2018 Hey , if you want to raise money for global health and get more philanthropy , he knows a lot of rich people.\n\u2019 \u201c Every meeting where I was with him were meetings with men .\nI was never at any parties or anything like that .\nHe never donated any money to anything that I know about.\n\u201d The Journal said its sources claimed that Bill and Epstein first met in 2011 , several years after Epstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentenced to 13 months confinement for soliciting prostitution from underage girls .\nThe conditions of that 2008 deal were a source of controversy 11 years later , when Epstein was charged with sex trafficking .\nFound dead in a New York jail , he was deemed to have killed himself .\nMelinda could become the world \u2019 s second-richest woman , with a

2011 , the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence was opened for signature in Istanbul and subsequently this human rights treaty has become popularly known as the Istanbul Convention .\nA year later , 12 March 2012 , Turkey became the first country to ratify the convention , and was then followed by 33 other countries in the period 2013-2019 \u2013 from Albania and Belgium to Sweden and Switzerland .\nLast month , the leader of Turkey \u2019 s opposition Republican People \u2019 s Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather unexpected honour as a group of 13 LGBT individuals , with a certain Beray G\u00f6ksu Ero\u011flu acting as their spokesperson , declared that they had \u201c proclaimed the esteemed K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu to be an honorary member of the LGBT family \u201d ( 12 April 2021 ) .\nThis admittedly somewhat strange act came about after K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu had defended LGBT individuals as posing no threat for the family or family values in Turkey on live television .\nAnd , family values are once again in the spotlight in the New Turkey , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ongoing violence against women in the land .\nFemicide in the New Turkey : Atat\u00fcrk , the Champion of Women \u2019 s Rights For , \u201c Turkey has withdrawn from the Istanbul Convention , \u201d as announced by the news agency Reuters : Turkey \u2019 s first popularly elected President took it upon himself to have his country pull out of the agreement in the midnight hour ( 19/20 March 2021 ) .\nIn the wee hours of Saturday ( 20 March ) , Reuters \u2018 Tuvan G\u00fcmr\u00fck\u00e7\u00fc and Jonathan Spicer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord , called the Istanbul Convention , pledged to prevent , prosecute and eliminate domestic violence and promote equality .\nTurkey signed it in 2011 , but femicide has surged in the country in recent years , \u201d adding that \u201c [ n ] o reason was provided for the withdrawal in the Official Gazette , where it was announced in the early hours on Saturday.\n\u201d The obvious-albeit-hidden rationale behind this drastic move seems to be the unending hatred for Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk ( 1881-1938 ) felt by Turkish ( and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many ( but not all ) women do regard Atat\u00fcrk as the ultimate champion of women \u2019 s rights \u2013 for he had been the one to break the shackles of the Sharia replacing god \u2019 s law with a secular civil code ( 1926 ) : \u201c The full emancipation of Turkish women took place after the proclamation of the Turkish Republic in 1923 .\nThis was because Atat\u00fcrk made the advancement of women a central aim of his social , religious and legal reforms by means of which he transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as expressed by Mehmet Birbiri , the host-nation advisor for the 39th Air Base Wing Public Affairs at Turkey \u2019 s \u0130ncirlik .\nBirbiri summarizes the nation \u2019 s founding father \u2019 s impact on women \u2019 s rights in the following succinct manner : The Islamist attacks on the figure and the memory of Atat\u00fcrk have been unrelenting in the New Turkey .\nEver since the Justice and Development Party ( or AKP ) came to power in 2002 , the government has been chipping away at the the Kemalist legacy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been largely replaced by that of Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ( aka the Prez ) in the official iconography of the Republic of Turkey .\nLast year \u2019 s reconversion of the Mosque of Ayasofya marked the \u201c the starting shot of the countdown to 2023 .\n.\n.\nwhich will be the year the world will learn whether .\n.\n.\nErdo\u011fan is the man who can and will really bring back Islamic rule to Turkey.\n\u201d Rather than coming right out and admitting the real reason behind the sudden pull out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationale worded by the Presidency \u2019 s Directorate of Communications : Nearly a year ago now , on 24 April 2020 , Dr Ali Erba\u015f , the Director of the Diyanet ( or Directorate of Religious Affairs ) said in a Friday Sermon that \u201c Islam curses homosexuality .\nWhat is the reason of that ?\nThe reason is that it brings with it illnesses and decay to lineage.\n\u201d As such , the 21st-century Sheikh-ul-Islam ( \u015eeyh\u00fclislam ) appears to object to homosexual behaviour as , by definition , such sexual relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the species or human procreation .\nOn this issue , the Quran says : \u201c Wealth and children are the adornment of this worldly life \u201d ( 18:46 ) .\nThese succinct words ever so subtly convey that predestination and the acquisition of god \u2019 s favour are the bedrock of religion in the New Turkey : the believe that god rewards true believers .\nThis Quranic verse all but exemplifies the AKP approach to Sunnification .\nOn the one hand , Turkey \u2019 s Islamist rulers are on best terms with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avarice oftentimes combining with outright corruption , nepotism or the gratuitous display of wealth and opulence .\nAt the same time , the AKP leadership busily advocates the pursuit of offspring as a sacred duty , which quite naturally translates into the propagation of traditional ( or polygamous ) family values and the condemnation of alternative modes of sexual self-expression and fulfillment .\nIn connection with the issue predestination or predeterminism or what as it is called in Turkish , kadercilik ( most commonly translated as fatalism ) , the Middle East specialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of the Arab historian and polymath Ibn Khaldun ( 1332-1406 ) : The Ottomans had been well aware of Khaldun \u2019 s anthropomorphic imagery and verdict ( from birth to death ) and tried hard to break this \u2018 evolutionary \u2019 circle .\nThe Ottoman historian Mustafa Naima Efendi ( 1655-1716 ) first popularized this mode of thinking in an Ottoman or Turkish context and in the New Turkey , the name Ibn Khaldun has once again crept up \u2013 the Ibn Haldun University \u2019 s ( IHU ) , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s district of Ba\u015fak\u015fehir in 2017 .\nRather than simply accepting Ibn Khaldun \u2019 s verdict that the Ottoman state was bound to wither and die , Naima suggested that this vicious circle could be broken by a skillful leader , which in his case was none that his patron Amcazade H\u00fcseyin Pa\u015fa ( 1644-1702 ) .\nIn the 21st century , Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is supposed to be the one to break the circle and guide the state \u2019 s ship into safe and secure waters , the safe and secure waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god , or rather , Allah \u2019 s will is in this context , but a prerequisite for success and glory .\nFor , the upshot of the above-quoted Quranic verse is that worldly success ( and abundant offspring ) denote divine favour and sanction .\nIn fact , the Prez all but builds upon his politico-religious base \u2013 the Naqshbandi order and M. Zahit Kotku ( 1897-1980 ) , the founder of the influential \u0130skenderpa\u015fa lodge .\nKotku thought that \u201c building an Islamic society was impossible without an Islamic capital.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a \u201c religious business association , \u201d established by a \u201c group of young and well-educated business people with strong Islamic orientation \u201d also came about as a result of the growing influence of the Naqshi way on the affairs of the state and the development of business opportunities .\nWhereas , Erdogan and his AKP cohort can easily find Quranic sanction for their open pursuit of neoliberal economic policies and their seemingly endless avarice , \u201c there is no prescribed [ punishment or even ] execution for homosexuality in the Quran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ Islamic ] scholars say , the Quran implies that retribution is in the hands of God , \u201d as worded by the Christian Science Monitor \u2018 s Taylor Luck .\nIn other words , Dr Ali Erba\u015f \u2019 s anti-gay position seems to have been more political than religious in nature .\nTurkey \u2019 s Minister for the Interior S\u00fcleyman Soylu appears to be a very popular and hence powerful politician in the land , with some even seeing him as a possible successor to Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in years to come .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on television to make some very serious statements , very serious statements that painted a purely heterosexual picture of the Ottoman past , while repeating the oft-heard trope that perversions from the West are to blame for the moral ( and sexual ) breakdown of Turkish society : On a purely semantic level , Soylu is somewhat correct as the term \u2018 homosexuality , \u2019 which has now evolved into the unwieldy acronym LGBT ( or LGBTQ ) , was apparently coined in or around the year 1868 by the Austro-Hungarian journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( formerly Karl-Maria Benkert , d.1882 ) .\nAs expressed by Dr \u0130rvin Cemil Schick , \u201c the German term Homosexualit\u00e4t is itself both modern and Western.\n\u201d The late appearance of the term does not mean that homosexual relations and/or activity should be seen as a fairly modern or even Western practice .\nSoylu \u2019 s words of moral outrage are also repeated by many popular Islamic figures currently populating Turkey \u2019 s media landscape and influencing public opinion .\nThe popular television preacher C\u00fcbbeli Ahmet Efendi ( which is a pseudonym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , last year came out saying that \u201c [ t ] his agreement [ referring to the Istanbul Convention ] legitimizes homosexual relationships , \u201d going on to describe homosexuality as a \u201c movement of corruption and depravity.\n\u201d And as a result , \u00dcnl\u00fc argued for the outright \u201c abolition \u201d of the \u201c agreement.\n\u201d The popular preacher spoke these words at the Aziz Mahmud H\u00fcdayi Vakf\u0131 , a religious foundation established on the grounds of the tomb ( or t\u00fcrbe ) of the saintly figure of Mahmud Hudayi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district of \u00dcsk\u00fcdar ( on \u0130stanbul \u2019 s Anatolian shoreline ) , a location with a particular pious flavour as in Ottoman times the annual holy pilgrimage to Mecca ( or the Hajj ) started here , which in turn led many members of the Ottoman family as well as grandees and dignitaries to erect mosques and other structures with a special religious function .\nThough he might have the appearance of a outright clown and harmless buffoon , C\u00fcbbeli Ahmet is an influential figure in today \u2019 s Turkey whose presence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet assures him of a captive audience .\nAt the same time , as an apprentice ( or , m\u00fcrid ) of the Naqshi sheikh Mahmut Ustaosmano\u011flu ( born 1929 ) , his close ties to the notorious \u0130smaila\u011fa Mosque and community in Fatih ( Istanbul ) , an offshoot of the Naqshbandi brotherhood , are also well-known .\nThis Naqshi connection also explains why this figure is more than just tolerated by the AKP establishment , which itself is part and parcel of the whole Naqshi complex as I have explained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents popular Islam in the New Turkey , Mehmet Boynukal\u0131n , the Head Preacher of the recently re-converted Ayasofya Mosque , represents the legalistic ( or scholarly ) and official version of the faith in the state \u2013 known as the \u0130lmiyye in the Ottoman tradition .\nIn fact , one could say that Boynukal\u0131n is a member of the New Turkey \u2019 s ulema ( the plural of the noun alim , commonly spelt as \u2018 ulama \u2019 in English transliteration and referring to the \u201c the learned of Islam , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 learning , \u2019 [ or knowledge or scholarship ] in its widest sense \u201d ) .\nIn the New Turkey , this class of \u2018 the learned of Islam \u2019 is incorporated into the office of the Directorate of Religious Affairs ( known as the Diyanet , in Turkish ) : \u201c in Ottoman times , the population [ of Istanbul ] looked to the Ayasofya for guidance , where the sermons delivered on Fridays carried special meaning , as the figure of the preacher had been appointed by the palace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , Boynukal\u0131n eagerly plays the part .\nA few hours after Turkey \u2019 s withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention , Ayasofya \u2019 s Head Preacher took to social media happily tweeting the following : \u201c The Istanbul Convention has been abrogated .\nPraised be god .\nMay Allah be pleased.\n\u201d For all intents and purposes , Boynukal\u0131n appeared to have been trying to become a latter-day Vani Mehmed Efendi ( d. 1685 ) , the preacher who had a hold in the city \u2019 s population as well as Sultan Mehmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the latter part of the 17th century .\nAlas , the 21st-century preacher \u2019 s ambitions appear to have backfired as he suddenly ( was forced to ) abandon ( ed ) public life to return to the world of academia , promulgating the news of his decision on social media on 8 April 2021 , specifically citing the controversy surrounding the withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention as one of the reasons .\n\u201c The Guard of the Harem \u201d oil on panel by Rudolf Ernst ( Austria , 1854\u20131932 ) Image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ottoman past as a heterosexual preserve couched in traditional ( or polygamous ) family units reduces human interactions and relationships to the production of offspring , with women being relegated to the care of the children in the house , while men run society and accumulate status , power and riches .\nAs if men and women did not interact in the past and do not in the present either , effectively dividing the world into harem and selaml\u0131k sections with women and children occupying the first and men the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of the past is presented as an icon of moral rectitude for the present and the future .\nIn this way , the AKP imagination has turned the Ottomans into pious adherents observing the strictest strict segregation of the sexes as proscribed in Islam .\nOn the other hand , a strict segregation of the sexes can not but lead to a proliferation of same-sex relations ( and relationships ) : \u201c In polygynous societies females are put at premium , and virtually all marry .\nHomosexual relations are especially likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with members of the opposite sex is entirely cut off , or when females are segregated and guarded , \u201d as related by the anthropologist Dr Jelena \u010cvorovi\u0107 .\nThe Ottoman centuries contain ample proof for Dr \u010cvorovi\u0107 \u2019 s thesis .\nIn the 15th century , for example , the Ottoman poet Mercimek A\u1e25med ( aka Merd\u0332j\u0332\u00fcmek or Ahmed b. \u0130lyas , late 14th/early 15th century ) produced a translation of an eleventh-century Persian book of counsel known as Q\u0101b\u016bs-n\u0101ma ( Book of Q\u0101b\u016bs ) .\nThis so-called \u2018 mirror for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K\u0101\u02be\u016bs b. Iskandar , a king of the short-lived Western Persian dynasty called the Ziyarids , containing advice for his favourite son .\nThe King gave his son the following advice regarding the conduct of sexual relations : This seasonal advice for switching between hetero and homosexual relations indicates that members of the Ottoman upper-classes had been well-aware if not well-versed in the finer points of human sexual relations .\nArchival documentation appears to attest that the Q\u0101b\u016bs-n\u0101ma had been in the palace holdings under Sultan Murad II ( 1421-44 , 1446-51 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be indications that young male prostitutes , possessed their very own \u201c guild \u201d in the urban framework of Ottoman commerce and trade , as illustrated by the investigative journalist and writer R\u0131za Zelyut who published a very telling book in this context .\nA historical fact that all but underlines the fact that positing the Ottoman era as a time of carefree heterosexuality is all but a flawed proposition .\nAlbeit , that \u201c there is officially no room for homosexuality or homosexuals within Islam , \u201d it seems clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in same-sex relations .\nKilling Women in the 21st Century : The New Turkey Reports of violence against women are on the rise globally in the 21st century .\nAnd Turkey is no exception .\nAs expressed by the Lake Forest College undergraduate Caroline Warrick acting as \u2018 article writer \u2019 for the Borgen Project : A bleak reminder that the situation for women is very dire in the New Turkey is a website

unilateral action is clearly seen by many as a direct attack on Turkish women : \u201c women [ have ] poured on to the streets of Turkish cities to protest , \u201d reported the BBC \u2019 s Esra Yal\u00e7\u0131nalp .\nThe AKP leadership \u2019 s willingness to return Turkey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined past of Ottoman heterosexuality as a haven for arguably polygamous family units , has now apparently led to a veritable real life battle of the sexes in the land , with male police manhandling female protestors .\nThis battle of the sexes that been going on for a long time , as illustrated by an article that appeared in the \u0130stanbul newspaper \u0130kdam on 24 September 1908 .\nApparently written by a woman calling herself Ke\u00e7ecizade \u0130kbal Han\u0131m in response to another

stepping stone towards the establishment of a male-dominated wholesome Islamic state known as the New Turkey .\nRather than admitting that Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s recent midnight action is somehow part

when once more the segregation of the sexes will become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s will and law .\nWill the upcoming centenary really bring back Islamic rule to Turkey , and will Turkey once again become a

scathing rebuke of the U.S. government \u2019 s approach to fighting the virus .\nHe says the government \u2019 s strategy , carried out in cooperation with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Nations World Health Organization , has resulted in tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths and is now being followed up with thousands more deaths caused by a mass-injection program .\nDr. Peter McCullough , in a 32-minute interview with journalist Alex Newman , said if this were any other vaccine it would have been pulled from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCullough holds the honor of being the most cited medical doctor on COVID-19 treatments at the National Library of Medicine , with more than 600 citations .\nHe has testified before Congress and won numerous awards during his distinguished medical career .\n.\nBetween Dec. 14 and April 23 , there were 3,544 deaths reported to the CDC \u2019 s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [ VAERS ] , along with 12,619 serious injuries .\nOne might expect these numbers would trigger an exhaustive investigation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to McCullough , the government has taken what amounts to a passing glance at the alarming numbers and dismissed them with a bare minimum of scrutiny .\n\u201c A typical new drug at about five deaths , unexplained deaths , we get a black-box warning , your listeners would see it on TV , saying it may cause death , \u201d McCullough said .\n\u201c And then at about 50 deaths it \u2019 s pulled off the market.\n\u201d The U.S. has a precedent for this .\nIn 1976 during the Swine Flu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million Americans , but at that point the shot caused about 500 cases of paralysis and 25 deaths .\n\u201c The program was killed , at 25 deaths , \u201d McCullough said .\nCompare that type of response to the government \u2019 s reaction to much higher reported death numbers related to the Moderna and Pfizer shots and the contrast is alarming , McCullough said , especially when the shots have not even been granted full FDA approval and are only being allowed on the market under an Emergency Use Authorization .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late March ] we have approximately 77 million people vaccinated for COVID and we have 2,602 deaths reported , so it \u2019 s unprecedented how many deaths have accrued , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Then on March 8 the CDC announced on their website with very little fanfare , that they had reviewed about 1,600 deaths with unnamed FDA doctors and they indicated not a single death was related to the vaccine , \u201d he added .\n\u201c I think that was concerning in the academic community.\n\u201d McCullough said he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation into 1,600 potentially vaccine-related deaths would have taken months to complete .\n\u201c I have chaired and participated in dozens of data safety monitoring boards and sat on those committees and I can tell you that this type of work would have taken many months to review all the labs , the death certificates and all the circumstances of an event .\nIt is impossible for unnamed regulatory doctors without any experience with COVID 19 to opine that none of the deaths were related to the vaccine.\n\u201d Previous studies , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 1 to 10 percent of all vaccine-related deaths get reported to VAERS .\nSo in all likelihood , there are more people dying than even gets reported , yet the FDA can \u2019 t come up with a single death related to the Moderna and Pfizer shots .\n\u201c Reporting a death requires a healthcare worker to enter it into the system , \u201d he said .\nAnd if the death does not occur within the normal 15-minute monitoring period they often go unreported .\nMost deaths occur within 72 hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on day one , two and three , \u201d he said .\nAs a matter of comparison : There are 20 to 30 deaths reported every year to VAERS related to the flu shot .\nThat \u2019 s with 195 million receiving flu shots .\nCompare that to the COVID shot , which resulted in 2,602 reported deaths through 77 million vaccinations .\nThat \u2019 s a stunningly high ratio of deaths to vaccinations , the highest for any vaccine in U.S. history , and yet no major media outlet has launched an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Alex Newman , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Leo Hohmann have been ruthlessly censored .\n\u201c So the U.S. government has made a decision , along with the stakeholders \u2013 the CDC , NIH , FDA , Big Pharma , World Health Organization , Gates Foundation \u2013 they have made a commitment to mass vaccination as the solution to the COVID pandemic and we are really going to be witness to what \u2019 s going to happen in history .\nWe \u2019 re sitting on , right now , the biggest number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tens of thousands of hospitalizations , all attributable to the vaccine , and going strong.\n\u201d McCullough testified before the U.S. Senate on Nov 19 , 2020 .\n\u201c I estimated at that time we could have saved half of the lives lost , \u201d he told Newman .\n\u201c There are now current estimates that we are up to about 85 percent of all lives lost could have been saved with something called sequenced oral multi-drug therapy.\n\u201d But instead , the government and its \u201c stakeholders \u201d in Big Pharma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , news organizations were recruited to present only one side of the vaccine story .\nMainstream outlets have agreed to not allow any news critical of the shots to reach the American people .\nThis corrupt collusion falls under the \u201c Trusted News Initiative , \u201d a global collaboration signed onto by Big Tech social-media giants and many of its corrupt corporate media \u201c partners.\n\u201d The partners signed onto the Trusted News Initiative to date are : Associated Press , AFP ; BBC , CBC/Radio-Canada , European Broadcasting Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times , First Draft , Google/YouTube , The Hindu , Microsoft , Reuters , Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism , Twitter , The Washington Post .\nThe New York Times has also participated in the past .\nReporting facts related to the dark side of the experimental mRNA vaccines is considered \u201c dangerous disinformation \u201d by the globalist media elites behind the Trusted News Initiative .\n\u201c So I think this was effectively a scrubbing , like we \u2019 ve seen elsewhere .\nThere is a Trusted News Initiative , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this was announced Dec. 10 , and this is a coalition of all the major media and government stakeholders in vaccination , where they are not going to allow any negative information about vaccines to get into the popular media because they \u2019 re concerned about vaccine hesitancy , that if Americans got any type of fair , balanced coverage on safety events then they simply would not come forward and get the vaccine.\n\u201d \u201c The Trusted News Initiative is really troublesome , \u201d he continued , \u201c because we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they continue to occur every day.\n\u201d Confirming a LeoHohmann.com report from earlier this month , McCullough said the Johnson & Johnson vaccine , while it does have issues with blood clots , is actually the safest of the three vaccines now being offered to Americans .\n\u201c In my professional opinion , the safest vaccine on the market was the J & J vaccine .\nAnd that was pulled for very rare blood-clotting events .\nWe had seven million people vaccinated but the estimates are for the other two vaccines available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times that of J & J , and these others are going strong.\n\u201d McCullough suggested that there is an incestuous relationship between the U.S. government and certain elements within Big Pharma , which causes regulators to look the other way when confronted with safety issues .\n\u201c A lot of Americans don \u2019 t understand how tight these stakeholders are .\nKeep in mind the NIH [ National Institutes of Health ] is a co-owner of the Moderna patent , so they have a vested financial interest in keeping these vaccines going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 months into the COVID nightmare , the evidence is beginning to suggest the U.S. government colluded from the outset with the Gates Foundation , CDC , FDA , the United Nations World Health Organization and Big Pharma to make the vaccines the central focus of the global COVID response effort .\nThey started promoting the vaccines before they were even out of clinical trials , McCullough said , which is against U.S. regulatory law .\nLeoHohmann.com has been getting reports that confirm Dr. McCullough \u2019 s warning that harmful events caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical establishment , the government , the legacy media and social-media giants Google , Facebook and Twitter .\nA physician with a practice in the Kansas City area told LeoHohmann.com that of a recent 500-person sampling of nursing-home patients who received the COVID injection , 22 died within 48 hours .\nThat represents an astonishing 4.4 percent death rate .\nMost people in the Kansas City area nursing homes are receiving the Pfizer shot , he said .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t prove they all died of the vaccine , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 hours , \u201d the physician told LeoHohmann.com .\n\u201c The requirements are they only need to be monitored for 15 minutes .\nSo we are never going to know the real numbers , \u201d he said .\n\u201c If it happens outside of that 15-minute window it \u2019 s going to be impossible to prove\u2026 If the FDA approves this then God help us.\n\u201d The Kansas City physician requested his name not be revealed for fear that he could lose his medical license .\nA Canadian doctor , Dr. Charles Hoffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public in defiance of a gag order , blowing the whistle on how \u201c Moderna shots killed , disabled patients.\n\u201d McCollough said the government has never placed a focus on treating sick patients , choosing instead to focus on the WHO recommended strategy of social distancing , lockdowns , masking and vaccines .\nIf the strategy had focused instead on a regimen that includes a multi-drug treatment of early onset symptoms , tens of thousands of lives could have been saved , he said .\nIn a December 2020 paper , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by step doctor \u2019 s plan that could save your life , McCullough prescribes a four-pronged strategy that includes contagion control , early home treatment , late-stage treatment and lastly vaccination .\n\u201c I talked about the four pillars , with the first pillar being contagion control [ wearing masks and lockdowns ] .\nWe \u2019 ve spent a lot of time on that .\nBut really the missing pillar , if we would have spent our time focusing on sick patients , that would have had the highest public-health value .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we developed a game plan \u2026that we were going to promote the importance of social distancing as part of contagion control and just have the population wait for a vaccine .\nThere have been no updates on treatment , not outpatient , not inpatient .\nWe don \u2019 t hear anything about sick patients .\nAll we heard was about masking , lockdowns and wait for a vaccine.\n\u201d *** Author Leo Hohmann is

really happened and why According to Italian frontline doctors and medical professions , numerous factors played into the formation of the \u2018 crisis \u2019 narrative which unfolded in northern

on to highly risky and unnecessary ventilator machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) compounding their already weak state , further driving up Italy \u2019 s sensational \u2018 COVID death \u2019 count at the time

quality of care and methods of treatment being given to both outpatients and inpatients .\nClearly , there were effective and often inexpensive drugs and therapeutic solutions available but which were

eight different vaccine passport schemes since last year .\nAnd that \u2019 s just the half of it .\nWe are midway through a Europe-wide feasibility study for the development of a common vaccine

injurious their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silent majority have lost their moral compass .\nBut it must be understood \u2013 this principle of divide and rule is as old as the hills .\nIt was not so long ago

moral imperative , discrimination is only frowned upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber stamped marks of distinction , whereas discrimination , of and by itself , is entirely permissible .\nThese crowd-pleasers

the actual evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of mask efficacy ?\nIn fact can someone point me to a single risk assessment for any of these scarcely credible interventions ?\nBut to deny someone entry

rules do not apply .\nWho are protected by more exemptions than the rest of us are governed by regulations ; and who , at the onset of the pandemic , were not caught with their pants down , as the general population was .\nAs this group spoke of herd immunity , they quietly struck a \u00a3119 million COVID advertising and propaganda deal with one of the world \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the UK \u2019 s biggest advertiser in 2020 .\nJust a day before the first lockdown , their Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours ( SPI-B ) began work on the most criminal propaganda campaign in British history .\nWhat most card-carrying conservative voters fail to realise is that this group is the county \u2019 s biggest employer , with 17 % of the British workforce employed in the public sector ; whose every agency has been pointed like cruise missiles at the general population , to essentially knock our stuffing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , towards what is arguably a controlled destination \u2013 the complete nullification of our rights , indefinitely .\nBut that \u2019 s only half of it .\nOnce you conflate unlawful policies with science that falls apart under the lightest of scrutiny

vaccine passports , it can not be denied \u2013 this is the same system of cast , class , eugenics , apartheid , persecution and slavery that would inflict those toppling statues with an extreme case of dashed hopes .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths which the political class is prepared to sink , is the collusion of a silent majority whose own complicity will result in the persecution of everyone else not toeing the line .\nAnd now with 353,341 variants at their disposal the government has 350,000 reasons to keep this fiasco going until hell freezes over .\nRiding roughshod over the British public who , make no mistake , will continue to weather such violations , in spectacular ignorance of the fact that only 388 healthy people under the age of 60 died from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death was 82 , and strangely enough , the vast majority had pre-existing conditions .\nEqually unremarkable is the fact that between 23 % -85 % of all deaths attributed to COVID , died from other underlying causes .\nAnd the fact that 2020 had a lower mortality rate than every single year prior to 2009 can be found in the dictionary under Ignorance is Bliss .\nYou would also be forgiven for assuming that once the most vulnerable had been vaccinated ( which is now ) , not much remains between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further attempts to protect us with more turns of the screw entirely defies common reason .\nYet here we are , fighting a battle for humanity .\nThe trouble , therefore , with lockdown skeptics such as Peter Hitchens publicly throwing in the towel , or Lord Sumption accepting the inevitability of vaccine passports \u2013 they have raised the white flag long before the real battle had begun .\nWhile lockdowns and social distancing represent the abstract of this ideological war , its frontlines are being waged on the physical surrender of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former is arbitrary , the later is systematised .\nOne is going to happen with or without your consent , the latter is wholly dependent on it .\nIt follows that for each skeptic who surrenders their compliance , they sell the rest of us downriver .\nThe balance swings more in favour of the New Normal .\nAnd let \u2019 s be honest , vaccine passports only work if a majority comply .\nSo while we still have the illusive veneer of democracy to hold onto , politicians remain duty-bound to at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of system of consent .\nJust as we

China is an \u2018Aggressor\u2019", "content": "US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has , in a 60 Minutes interview , accused China of acting \u201c repressively at home and more aggressively abroad , \u201d emphasizing it as a \u201c fact.\n\u201d He repeated unfounded claims that \u201c 1 million \u201d Uyghurs are being interned in facilities in China \u2019 s western region of Xinjiang and referred to it as \u201c genocide.\n\u201d He also referred to what he and the US establishment regularly call a \u201c rules-based \u201d international order and insisted that the United States is not trying to \u201c contain \u201d China , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims China is challenging .\nSecretary Blinken would also claim that the US is not seeking conflict with China and that it doesn \u2019 t serve US interests to even head in that direction .\nIn reality \u2013 US policies of containing China have been ongoing for decades and it could easily be argued that the US is already at conflict with China .\nThe accusations made by the US are a form of projection \u2013 the taking of one \u2019 s own unacceptable qualities or feelings and \u201c projecting \u201d them onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSecretary Blinken unflinchingly made these claims about China even as the US wages multiple illegal wars of aggression and enduring military occupations around the globe including in Iraq , Syria , and Afghanistan , while also backing several more proxy conflicts including in Yemen \u2013 a conflict the UN itself has claimed is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world .\nClaims of \u201c 1 million \u201d Uyghurs being interned within China \u2013 even if it were true \u2013 would pale in comparison to the 2003 US invasion and occupation of Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died .\nIn the lead up to the US invasion of Iraq the US maintained crippling economic sanctions on Iraq .\nIn another 60 Minutes interview \u2013 this time with then US Ambassador to the UN Madeline Albright \u2013 she was asked if she had heard half a million children died because of US sanctions and if that price was worth it .\nAlbright would respond by claiming , \u201c I think that is a very hard choice , but the price , we think , the price is worth it.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the wealthiest and most developed nations on the African continent into a divided failed state \u2013 is another showcase of US \u2013 not \u201c Chinese \u201d aggression .\nFar from \u201c whataboutism , \u201d there is nothing that China has even been accused of doing this century that is even remotely comparable .\nThe US is already at Conflict with China The Chinese presence in the South Sea cited by Blinken , is countering the uninvited presence of US warships .\nIt can hardly be considered \u201c aggression \u201d rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military presence of a foreign nation already in the middle of multiple wars of aggression around the globe including one directly on China \u2019 s own borders .\nIndeed , US troops are still occupying Afghanistan \u2013 a nation that actually shares part of its border with China .\nAnd whether US forces withdraw or not \u2013 the US fully plans to maintain military contractors and intelligence operators within the country for many more years to come \u2013 a war by any other name .\nThe US presence in Afghanistan has deliberately fanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has been one of several vectors of extremism flowing into China \u2019 s western region of Xinjiang .\nBlinken \u2013 in his 60 Minutes interview \u2013 would claim the US \u201c doesn \u2019 t see \u201d the terrorist threat Beijing has cited as the impetus for security operations and deradicalization programs implemented in Xinjiang .\nBut a causal search through even the West \u2019 s own media in previous years indicates not only a genuine terrorism problem \u2013 but one many times more widespread than alleged terrorism targeting the West .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there tension between China and the Uighurs ?\n, \u201d would list a multitude of terrorist attacks over just two years ( emphasis added ) : In June 2012 , six Uighurs reportedly tried to hijack a plane from Hotan to Urumqi before they were overpowered by passengers and crew .\nThere was bloodshed in April 2013 and in June that year , 27 people died in Shanshan county after police opened fire on what state media described as a mob armed with knives attacking local government buildings .\nAt least 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered injuries in May 2014 when two cars crashed through an Urumqi market and explosives were tossed into the crowd .\nChina called it a \u201c violent terrorist incident \u201d .\nIt followed a bomb and knife attack at Urumqi \u2019 s south railway station in April , which killed three and injured 79 others .\nIn July , authorities said a knife-wielding gang attacked a police station and government offices in Yarkant , leaving 96 dead .\nThe imam of China \u2019 s largest mosque , Jume Tahir , was stabbed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 died in blasts in Luntai county outside police stations , a market and a shop .\nDetails of both incidents are unclear and activists have contested some accounts of incidents in state media .\nSome violence has also spilled out of Xinjiang .\nA March stabbing spree in Kunming in Yunnan province that killed 29 people was blamed on Xinjiang separatists , as was an October 2013 incident where a car ploughed into a crowd and burst into flames in Beijing \u2019 s Tiananmen Square .\nThe terrorism is part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Endowment for

lists the World Uyghur Congress ( WUC ) as US government funding recipients .\nThe WUC openly advocates separatism on its official website .\nBacking separatism in China \u2013 something the US would most likely consider an act of war were China openly doing it to the US \u2013 is not the United State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but obviously already well in the middle of it .\nBetween the US military presence on China \u2019 s furthermost western border and tens of thousands of US forces present in Japan and South Korea to China \u2019 s immediate east \u2013 the US is also involved in multiple proxy

consequences of COVID-19 vaccines suggests that the controversial mRNA vaccines \u2013 Moderna and Pfizer \u2013 may lead to unexpected neurological conditions similar to Mad Cow Disease .\nThe review by Stephanie Seneff , who works at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT , and Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Immerson Health in Portland , Oregon , was released this week in the International Journal of Vaccine Theory , Practice , and Research , and devotes a considerable space to discussing the research of Dr. J. Bart Classen , who first published a research paper on the possibility of prion-linked brain degeneration caused by the COVID-19 vaccine last month , and expands on his research .\nThe researchers explain that \u201c researchers have identified a signature motif linked to susceptibility to misfolding into toxic oligomers , called the glycine zipper motif .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ two glycine residues spaced by three intervening amino acids , represented as GxxxG .\nThe bovine prion linked to MADCOW has a spectacular sequence of ten GxxxGs in a row , \u201d and notes that \u201c the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a transmembrane protein , and that it contains five GxxxG motifs in its sequence \u201d and , thus , \u201c it becomes extremely plausible that it could behave as a prion \u201d .\n\u201c Recall that the mRNA vaccines are designed with an altered sequence that replaces two adjacent amino acids in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolines , \u201d the authors continue .\n\u201c This is done intentionally in order to force the protein to remain in its open state and make it harder for it to fuse with the membrane .\nThis seems to us like a dangerous step towards misfolding potentially leading to prion disease.\n\u201d Prions were first described as the method by which Mad Cow Disease causes brain degeneration due to misfolding proteins in the body .\nThe CDC notes that \u201c prion diseases are usually rapidly progressive and always fatal.\n\u201d Mad Cow Disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain dormant for decades , \u201d per the BBC .\n\u201c Pfizer claims the RNA fragments \u2018 likely\u2026 will not result in expressed proteins \u2019 due to their assumed rapid degradation in the cell , \u201d the researchers note .\nThey add , \u201c While we are not asserting that

the whole COVID crisis has been the ease in which the current range of experimental COVID vaccines and mRNA gene therapy injections have been automatically waved through the normal regulatory processes in countries like the US and UK .\nThe reason given last year was based on spurious claims that COVID-19 had become an unstoppable \u2018 raging global pandemic \u2019 and therefore any medium or long-term research and safety testing had to be dispensed with in order to \u2018 save lives.\n\u2019 What normally would take 5 to 7 years to develop safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving to humans after a careful long-established development process \u2013 had suddenly been compressed into a mere 7 months .\nThis questionable move by governments may ultimately backfire as the public begin to realize that they have been unofficially enrolled in what has now become the largest human pharmaceutical experiment in history .\nIn the past , an \u201c Emergency Use Authorization \u201d ( EUA ) would only be granted for a limited period , and only then for use within a specific section of the population who was deemed the most vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under this current EUA regime , vaccines being allowed to bypass regular safety protocols indefinitely , as well as for any \u2018 top-up \u2019 vaccines .\nAfter months of silence , some high-ranking public health officials and qualified scientists are finally beginning to speak up and challenge the omnipotence of the dominant transnational drug firms which appear to be dictating global medical policy .\nThese scientists went on to sow doubt on many of baseless claims routinely made by government ministers and numerous \u2018 public health \u2019 experts appearing in mainstream media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an endless steam of COVID booster shots will be necessary in order to keep pace with an endless stream of alleged coronavirus \u2018 variants of concern.\n\u2019 The report also states how some WHO officials are beginning to admit that vaccine makers may be over-stepping the mark : Some of these scientists expressed concern that public expectations around COVID-19 boosters are being set by pharmaceutical executives rather than health specialists , although many agreed that preparing for such a need as a precaution was prudent.\n\u201d \u201c We don \u2019 t see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about whether or not booster doses are needed , \u201d said Kate O \u2019 Brien , director of the Department of Immunization , Vaccines and Biologicals at the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .\nO \u2019 Brien said the WHO is forming a panel of experts to assess all variant and vaccine efficacy data and recommend changes to vaccination programs as needed .\nIt appears that government ministers and their public health mavens are being fed \u2018 booster shot \u2019 talking points directly from the pharmaceutical giants \u2013 who will likely double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that every person will need a vaccine \u2018 top-up \u2019 or else they might be suddenly stricken by some new virus mutation circulating at any given time \u2013 a claim which is not based on any actual scientific evidence .\nBased only on their daily revised claims and theories and computer-modelled projections , pharma experts have also been calling on everyone to take their annual \u2018 COVID shot \u2019 which executives hope

"title": "Biden: US Will Now Export Its Unlicensed Experimental Vaccines", "content": "As the old saying goes , simply follow the money .\nAs the vaccine roll-out peters out in the US and other western countries , political leaders will be keen to find a home for hundreds of millions of wasted doses purchased by governments , but also to help Big Pharma gain a subsidized foothold in foreign markets .\nBack on May 4th , President Joe Biden hailed his milestone achievements of mass-injections : \u201c Well , as everyone knows , I promised that we \u2019 d administer 100 million shots in my first 100 days .\nAfter we met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a \u2014 a historic 200 million shots .\nBy the time we reached 100 days last week , we had shattered that mark with over 220 million shots in arms.\n\u201d Joe proudly crowed about his new world record of getting experimental pharmaceutical \u201c shots in arms , \u201d but his victory speech is somewhat misleading .\nUnfortunately , a large number of Joe \u2019 s total \u2018 shots \u2019 are absorbed in double counting , which means that 200 million people have not been \u2018 fully vaccinated.\n\u2019 That \u2019 s because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pharmaceutical giants and their \u2018 public health \u2019 cohort in what is arguably one of the greatest marketing stunts ever conceived \u2013 that for the first time in history , people were told they needed two injections rather than one , in order to be \u2018 effective against COVID.\n\u2019 This clever confidence trick has virtually doubled sales and profits for the corporate drug cartel while allowing politicians to inflate their \u2018 shot \u2019 totals to give a false impression of how many people have actually been vaccinated with the new experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the FDA ) .\nWhen you add this to the overall COVID-19 fear propaganda campaign , along with the media constantly hyping artificial scarcity by promoting the idea of vaccine shortages ( see \u201c free the vaccine \u201d campaign ) , a demand , and thus markets have been created which pharmaceutical firms could only dream of in previous times .\nDespite desperate efforts by the White House , including Biden television addresses where the President was practically begging Americans to \u2018 just take the shot \u2019 and even veiled threats by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not \u2018 comply \u2019 with mask mandates and injections \u2013 despite all that , to date approximately 33 % of Americans have accepted the experimental vaccines and mRNA gene therapy injections .\nBased on these numbers , Biden \u2019 s ambitious vaccine roll-out appears to have stalled .\nWorse yet , as reports continue pouring in about adverse reactions and fatalities from the experimental jabs , the Government , and its partners in Mainstream Media and Big Pharma \u2013 are in a race to try and move as many units as possible before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public at large .\nTheir window is closing , and so expect increasingly desperate claims and proclamations being made by politicians in Big Pharma stakeholder countries .\nThis means there are millions of doses of vaccines paid for by US taxpayers which will never get used \u2013 mountains of experimental jab-stock which the government is now keen to dump its redundant stock on some poor developing countries , preferably in Africa , or possibly south Asia , before claiming the gesture as \u2018 humanitarian aid , \u2019 along with the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 and so on .\nMuch of this corporate trade can be easily laundered by way of UN and NGO program , including through UNICEF , USAID and others .\nIdeally , this export business will develop into a reoccurring sales channel for Big Pharma , with the ultimate goal of opening up new markets for drug giants by getting the US taxpayer to subsidize vaccine exports in the form of \u2018 foreign aid \u2019 and using the national security apparatus to \u201c steer doses abroad \u201d under the auspices of \u2018 global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare for Big Pharma .\nIn this way , the US government is acting as a dedicated marketing and distribution partner for transnational pharmaceutical corporations .\nAnd so the global experiment continues\u2026 .\nPresident Joe Biden plans to send an additional 20 million doses of U.S. coronavirus vaccines abroad by the end of June \u2014 including , for the first time , shots authorized for domestic use , where supply is beginning to outstrip demand .\nBiden will announce Monday that he \u2019 ll export 20 million doses of vaccines from Pfizer Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on top of 60 million AstraZeneca Plc doses he had already planned to give to other countries , according to a senior administration official familiar with the plan .\nThe official , who asked not to be identified ahead of planned remarks from the president , stressed that the measures are only a first step as the U.S. pivots its attention to quelling the pandemic abroad .\nBiden has previously pledged that the U.S. would soon become an \u201c arsenal \u201d of global vaccine supply .\nBiden will also announce that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served as the White House coronavirus response coordinator , in charge of his effort to beat back the pandemic globally , the official said .\nZients will work with the National Security Council and other agencies to steer doses abroad .\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the announcement , saying that the doses would go \u201c to help countries battling the pandemic , \u201d without specifying which ones .\nThe 60 million AstraZeneca doses are subject to a safety review before they \u2019 ll be shipped\u2026 See up to date UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : https : //yellowcard.ukcolumn.org/yellow-card-reports

litany of so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions , and also pharmaceutical interventions \u2013 were deemed by the consensus to be essential measures in fighting the spread of what was being characterized as an asymptomatic disease .\nOver a year later , a few industrious \u2018 public health \u2019 mavens have summoned the courage to actually test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK , officials have staged and monitored nine large-scale events , including an FA Cup final football match , and the Brit Awards \u2013 both of which were exempt from the usual COVID rules .\nThe results of this test should be

\u201c super-spreader \u201d events .\nNine large-scale events were staged as part of the government \u2019 s plan to allow for the return of big crowds this summer .\nThose who attended were exempt

spreaders , \u201d and it \u2019 s not difficult to see how problematic this widely held assumption is now becoming , with many media doctors and public health officials now facing challenges over @ @

asymptomatic disease is that it wasn \u2019 t done by a biologist but instead by individuals ( probably on the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours ( SPI-B ) ) whose agenda is not to convey accurate information to the public but something different : fear and uncertainty.\n\u201d It \u2019 s been 14 months , and the world has been turned upside-down , and the billionaire class have reached new heights in wealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else has slid downwards .\nLet there be a reckoning .\nIt \u2019 s time to talk about the real science \u2013 which does not even remotely

.\nImagine with me : a plate of food that fulfills all your nutritional needs , that is provided to you for free , that has a whole host of fancy labels declaring it , for example , carbon neutral and \u2018 fair trade.\n\u2019 It is produced by a handful of global companies , who through thousands of experiments have produced this optimal super-food .\nThere is genetically modified cauliflower that is rammed with extra vitamins , meat-free soya alternatives that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes everything taste amazing .\nIt doesn \u2019 t sound too bad does it ?\nIf somebody told you that there was a plan to revolutionise the global food system from the top down , would you believe them ?\nWell perhaps after reading this article you will see that we are rapidly approaching that point today .\nFood security is something that we in the West , for the most part , take for granted .\nThere is affordable food in plentiful stock in shops in every town .\nThe difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldly foods , which to eat for dinner \u2013 though it wasn \u2019 t ever thus .\nWe humans have gone through periods of intense famine and great struggle for sustenance .\nOur bodies still have coping mechanisms for starvation and we are still driven by base urges for those sweet and fatty foods which would see us through Winters yore .\nIt doesn \u2019 t seem like we will be returning to that hungerous state any time soon , surely not in this world of plenty .\nIn this world of plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDespite those shop-shelves being full , there are millions of families going hungry , even in those supposedly \u2018 economically advanced \u2019 nations .\nIt is one of the strongest indictments of modern society that in such relative abundance , so many must go without .\nIt shouldn \u2019 t need to be explained but economic downturns and jumps in hunger go hand-in-hand .\nThe 2008 economic crisis ( whereby states funded big banks at the expense of the population ) caused , two years later , a concurrent rise in food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure shows that there \u2019 s a roughly two year lag time between the initial economic shock and an increase in food insecurity .\nIt also informs us that the most vulnerable in society are disproportionately affected by an economic downturn .\nA cursory glance at headlines tells us that the problem has got worse under the political reign of Coronavirus .\nOver 1 million ( 14 % ) of New Jersey residents are \u2018 food insecure \u2019 as a result of COVID-19 , says the Community Foodbank of New Jersey .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for some reform in the food sector : enter the Rockefeller Foundation .\nHopefully you have at least heard of \u2018 the Great Reset \u2019 by now .\nIt is the World Economic Forum \u2019 s designation for a massive shift in all spheres of society on the back of the great crisis of 2020 .\nIts author , Klaus Schwab , destroys any hope for our old society when he says , \u201c Many of us are wondering when things will return to normal .\nThe short response is : never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early months of 2020 is no more \u201d .\nThe so-called \u2018 elites \u2019 , whom I like to think of as greedy sociopaths , have taken it upon themselves to re-order the whole of the world economy and society .\nGoing by current trends this reset will benefit the billionaire class massively at the expense of the rest of us .\nIn July 2020 , the Rockefeller Foundation released a paper entitled \u2018 Reset the Table : Meeting the Moment to Transform the U.S. Food System \u2019 .\nThis outlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system ; from farm to mouth they have a plan to \u2018 Reset the table \u2019 ( although I prefer our moniker \u2013 The Plate Reset ) .\nI encourage you to give it a look , though it is more than a mealy mouthful to try and digest .\nLet us look through the main aims ; they call each of them a \u2018 Shift \u2019 perhaps a testament to the \u2018 nudge \u2019 theory of psychological manipulation that is the main tool of government today , whereby wholesale change is achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surmise them , these shifts are : \u2022 To Integrate the \u2018 food system \u2019 under one political aegis \u2022 To Collectivise and centralise control of the supply of food \u2022 To engender \u2018 Prosperity \u2019 \u2013 i.e .\nto enrich the stakeholders Some of the proposals here will appeal to your average voter .\nThey offer us talk of making every dollar go farther ; to boost nutrition and better feed the kids .\nThose of us who are more sceptical of political claims can see through the fog .\nHaving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold within a local area for example , is a good answer to the wasteful international system at present .\nAlthough I would prefer it to be a grassroots co-ordinated affair , it seems that the plan is to introduce regional schema from on high .\nPart of the trouble with these wide-ranging edicts is that they have a bad track record .\nThe document the Rockefeller Foundation even admit to these faults .\nTheir previous attempts at shifting the food paradigm , known to them as the \u2018 green revolution \u2019 lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense of more nutrient-rich foods , reliance on chemical fertilizers that deplete the soil , and overuse of water.\n\u201d What makes them think that they will do better on the second bite of the cherry ?\nAs part of this shift , the ever-wise Davos gang want us to see healthy food as a right .\nThis is similar to moves being made to define a stable income as a right through Universal Basic Income .\nFood as a right has been pushed by Prince Charles since at least 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic declaring Charles as on the side of the little guy against corporate power .\nAs an aside we must note that Prince Charles was present and gave a speech at the launch of the Great Reset , it seems these agendas move in small circles .\nOn the face of it , having access to good food as a right seems logical \u2013 it should ensure that more people receive adequate food .\nHowever , as we go on examining the machinations of this novel system , that \u2018 right \u2019 may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s hungry .\nPart of the plan is to re-organise how food is distributed .\nThey wish to place schools at the center of this distributive mechanism \u2013 this would ensure that all school kids have a chance at getting a good diet , who could argue with that ?\nWith the campaign of the Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford there is now a concerted effort to put the responsibility for distributing food onto the schools .\nIt has been presented in the media as a pitched battle between the Tories in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is full co-operation from the government to build a scheme of food distribution in schools .\nThe next step is one of the most interesting , to declare food as medicine .\nWe all know that healthy eating is better than any preventative medicine and that diet has a huge impact on health .\nSo it isn \u2019 t much of a leap to think of food as medicine .\nBut what the Plate Reset has in store for us is so much more than just nutrition .\nThere are plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the basic nutrients we need , probably a good thing .\nHowever having food defined as medicine by the state makes it possible to outlaw unhealthy foods , or to tightly regulate our very diet , which could become a bad thing .\nIt has already been announced that the government can monitor COVID through the inspection of sewage wastewater .\nBiobot Analytics is one large company that has government contracts for \u2018 wastewater surveillance \u2019 , we don \u2019 t yet know how far this surveillance technology can go .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control you in this way , there is little chance of escaping such a deep level of insitutionalisation .\nWe can also look forward to Silicon Valley \u2019 s corporate stooges getting ther slice of the pie too .\nFoodID is a joint project between big-tech conglomerates such as Facebook and Google , to provide certification for food ; whether it \u2019 s medicinal , sourced responsibly and interestingly to ensure \u201c compliance \u201d .\nIf your local small farmer can \u2019 t afford to keep up with the latest shift in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made illegal .\nOne facet of the \u2018 food as medicine \u2019 agenda worth digging into is the prospect for an edible vaccine .\nThe idea is fairly simple .\nThrough the magic of gene editing , scientists purportedly will insert genetic material from a virus into a foodstuff in such a way that when it is eaten , it will engender an immune response and thus cause an immunity to the virus .\nAn edible COVID vaccine is already being touted in experiments using a micro-algae , it may not be appetising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore it has been successfully achieved in vaccinating against Hepatitis B by editing the genes of a tobacco plant .\nPerhaps this is a good thing for those needle-phobes among us , but it does raise some ethical questions about how far the gene-editing snowball will roll .\nThis section is more about creating institutions and instruments than to support the farming industry .\nAgain they acknowledge that the current system treats poorer communities unfairly , but the resolution they offer is to simply surveil the recipients of government aid in more detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and medium farmers \u201d but they are quickly sidelined with talk of \u201c more agile and diverse regional food chains \u201d .\nIt is this subtle creep of corporate power that actually threatens our food security yet they continue to dress themselves in garments of a saviour .\nBy re-allocating funds , creating government stimulus plans and creating regional food hubs they detail their plan to centralise the system of food procurement .\nThey already claim to have the power to \u201c Direct the purchasing power of large institutions along a values-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given their drive for profit at any cost , what ethics are these values actually beholden to ?\nStep one of ensuring prosperity for the few is mandatory regulation .\nWith the alleged aim of keeping people \u201c safe \u201d , these regulations are clearly aimed at eliminating all competition .\nMuch as a targeted herbicide can kill all plant life other than the required crop , and create super weeds which end up threatening the very food you \u2019 re intending to harvest , these policies will regulate small farmers all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAgain this claim of \u2018 safety \u2019 is merely a palliative facade included to soften the blow of the globalized financialisation of the food system .\nThe facade quickly drops when we read that : The bogus nature of their externalities calculations are laid bare .\nAny claims to lessen the amount of Carbon Dioxide produced , or costs saved to healthcare are purely hypothetical , and presented without proof .\nYet these are the golden rules , supposedly the moral compass that is guiding the policy package .\nWe have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board the green eco-bandwagon , so it should be no surprise that corporate giants would hold these tiny fig leaves up to cover their ransacking of nature through the Plate Reset too .\nAs we go through this section we find it is much standard fare for the corporate world .\nThey salivate over the $ 18 billion dollar \u201c market \u201d that is school dinners .\nThey would like those tax dollars to be \u201c injected \u201d into their regional hubs who will funnel it to \u201c good food \u201d vendors \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones that the Rockefellers et al have shares in .\nOne Rockefeller institution is YieldWise : \u201c YieldWise will reduce reliance of farmers on volatile prices in the market by finding large anchor buyers\u2014both multinationals like Coca Cola , Unilever and local ones mainly in Sub Saharan Africa \u201d .\nYes that \u2019 s right , Coca Cola is saving the starving Africans through institutional investment frameworks , we can all now sleep well at night .\nOf course , as with any social paradigm shift roll-out we need a parallel system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernise \u201d the agricultural system \u2013 they can \u2019 t let all that juicy data go to waste .\nThis will feed into \u201c real-time \u201d systems of aggregated data analysis allowing producers to see where demand is growing and act accordingly .\nIt sounds like a viable plan , though it quickly turns Orwellian : State agencies should systematically leverage data they collect on households\u2014such as income\u2014to facilitate enrollment .\nBy bringing together unemployment , household income , and other census and survey data\u2026 \u201d .\nSo that \u2019 s every shred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every move being vacuumed up into a nebulous global system of corporate food production .\nAnd there was me enjoying the old normal .\nMake no mistake ; this agenda is coming down the road , possibly in as little as just two years away , undoubtedly fast-tracked by the perceived Covid crisis .\nHowever we have a set of eliding conditions which lead to a worrisome picture .\nThere is a global shortage of seeds , such that the alternative to the Plate Reset , namely small-scale anarcho-agriculture , is left floundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds , they can easily be declared as \u201c non-essential \u201d as happened in the UK in March of this year .\nThere are other looming Black Swans looming foreboding at our horizon .\nUkraine and Russia , seen as the breadbasket of Europe and Asia , have seen a 20 % drop in grain production , this is mirrored in other crops and countries .\nThe USA has seen its lowest acreage of Wheat since the dust bowl of last century .\nPotatoes and corn are faring similarly poorly .\nOne reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production is the approaching Grand Solar Minimum .\nThis is the weakening of the Sun \u2019 s heating power , based on well documented Milankovitch cycles .\nIf we are to enter a long period of global cooling , with a weakening Sun , then it is imperative that we have the tools to feed ourselves .\nThe traditional method of using a wide range of heirloom varieties seems to be a good tactic .\nThe ancient civilisation based around Lake Titicaca , for example , grew about 3,800 species of potato , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,000 years later .\nWe can share seeds , and learn to germinate them ourselves .\nWe can develop community-based farming practices very easily , the information is readily accessible .\nThese are not the tips you will find in the billionaires \u2019 Great Reset agenda , because they do not generate long-term profit for a select few investors .\nHowever , those of us who value our human relationship with nature , and understand the follies of centralised corporate power should find great recourse to them .\nI leave you with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1924 , that seems to be very apt today : I

done by measures to supposedly protect the public from it \u2013 the endless contradictions , missteps , manipulations , and outright lies spread by the supposed \u2018 experts \u2019 and \u2018 healthcare professionals \u2019 has reached mountainous heights .\nFrom government flip-flopping over mask mandates and social distancing measures , to vaccines pushed onto the public and rushed through the regulatory approval process in record time ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the contraction or spread of the virus ) the only thing one can be sure of is that we aren \u2019 t being told the truth about a great many things , and that the self-appointed arbiters of this crisis can not be trusted .\nAnd even before the COVID-19 crisis began \u2013 those charged by Western civilization to mobilize a response already had well-established , long-standing irrefutable track record of fraud , corruption , and criminality ranging from global bribery rackets and falsifying research and safety data , to deliberately putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the market .\nCorporations involved in development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines included Johnson & Johnson \u2013 a company recently implicated in selling asbestos contaminated baby powder for years \u2013 knowing it was dangerous but withholding knowledge of this danger from both regulators and the public .\nDespite no longer selling the tainted powder in North America , it still continues to sell it overseas , NPR in its article , \u201c Johnson & Johnson Stops Selling Talc-Based Baby Powder In U.S. And Canada , \u201d would note .\nOne might ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about its otherwise criminal behavior .\nThe answer might have something to do with the firm also being caught up in bribery scandals .\nOne , reported on in Reuters \u2019 2019 article , \u201c Exclusive : FBI targets Johnson & Johnson , Siemens , GE , Philips in Brazil graft case \u2013 sources , \u201d would note : Brazilian prosecutors suspect the companies channeled illegal payoffs to government officials to secure contracts with public health programs across the South American country over the past two decades .\nAnother COVID-19 beneficiary , Pfizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public officials around the globe to obtain regulatory approval where the merits and necessity of their products otherwise couldn \u2019 t , as reported by the Washington Post in its 2012 article , \u201c Pfizer agrees to pay $ 60M to settle foreign bribery case.\n\u201d Moderna , who up until the COVID-19 crisis had never actually brought a viable product to market , was immediately embroiled in multiple conflicts of interest and demonstrable corruption when selected to receive hundreds of millions of US dollars in funding for its vaccine candidate .\nCBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Watchdog urges SEC to investigate vaccine maker Moderna.\n\u201d Companies like Johnson & Johnson , Pfizer , Moderna , and others clearly expand into markets and then sidestep safety and efficacy issues through criminal practices , before receiving , at best , a few slaps on the wrist from Western regulators and law enforcement agencies .\nThey not only remaining in business to this day , but being placed at the top of list to profit from supposed crises like COVID-19 .\nSEE ALSO : COVID-19 : The Emergence of the Pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly corrupt and compromised \u2013 it was always difficult to ascertain credible information regarding COVID-19 .\nLacking our own labs and experts to test for and determine with certainty the threat posed by COVID-19 , and the claimed efficacy and safety of proposed vaccines , or treatment protocols for those already infected \u2013 meant we were given the choice of deciphering constantly contradicting narratives from so-called \u2018 public health \u2019 and healthcare \u2018 experts \u2019 who are largely in the pay of Big Pharma , against little to no reliable data we ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis where we can personally observe protests , conflicts , and other aspects defining it \u2013 COVID-19 involved a virus invisible to our naked eye and indiscernible without sophisticated equipment and trained professionals needed to operate it .\nThe infrastructure and human resources required to ascertain the real threat level and actual risk of COVID-19 , or any other threat to human health and effective measures to guard against them \u2013 are entirely monopolized by a transnational corporatized system we know is fundamentally and irreparably corrupt , and which is driven by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one which seems to always benefits the more the sicker we get .\nThis is a fundamental truth few would attempt to argue , and yet , it is common ground most people can meet on even if they have differing or opposing views regarding COVID-19 and vaccines .\nWhat would anyone on either side of that debate have to lose by creating and utilizing truly independent and fully transparent medical research and human healthcare institutions ?\nWhen considering the larger picture , this is a problem that extends far beyond COVID-19 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and development regarding healthcare , treatments , and cure .\nA perfect example of this is the now FDA-approved leukemia-curing CAR T-cell therapy ( called \u201c Kymriah \u201d ) developed by University of Pennsylvania researcher Dr. Carl June through funding from both the public and a charity called Leukemia & Lymphoma Society ( LLS ) .\nThe first trials were described in a 2011 New York Times article titled , \u201c An Immune System Trained to Kill Cancer , \u201d which reported : Doctors removed a billion of his T-cells \u2014 a type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tumors \u2014 and gave them new genes that would program the cells to attack his cancer .\nThen the altered cells were dripped back into Mr. Ludwig \u2019 s veins .\nLudwig \u2019 s immune system , with its newly reprogrammed T-cells , began attacking his cancer .\nThe article would then note : The trials would continue saving critically ill patients who would have otherwise died .\nAmong these patients was 6 year old Emily Whitehead .\nThe NYT in a 2012 article titled , \u201c In Girl \u2019 s Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d reported : Today , nine years later , she is still cancer-free .\nThe treatment is nothing short of revolutionary .\nThe techniques used to cure cancer could \u2013 with modifications and a full understanding of the genes involved , could be used for everything from permanently curing diabetes to rebuilding heart tissue damaged from cardiovascular disease .\nWhat was even more incredible was how \u2013 even under experimental conditions \u2013 the CAR T-cell therapy was shockingly cheap \u2013 cheaper than a bone marrow transplant .\nThe New York Times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The obvious implications of a single-shot permanent cure for a criminally corrupt pharmaceutical industry is virtual extinction .\nIt would be an industry no longer able to profit from illness with permanent cures costing less than single rounds of perpetual \u201c treatments.\n\u201d Thus , what followed next should have surprised no one .\nPharmaceutical giant Novartis swooped in with its financial muscle and \u201c licensed \u201d the experimental therapy , bringing it through final clinical trials , before renaming the CAR T-cell therapy \u201c Kymriah \u201d and slapping a $ 475,000 price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This placed it well beyond the reach of patients and prevented this achievement from being built upon by others around the globe to expand the life-saving capabilities of this technology .\nWorst of all , Novartis was a \u201c partner \u201d with the charity LLS who collected the money of ordinary people to fund this breakthrough\u2026 before handing the results over to Big Pharma .\nIn other words \u2013 LLS and other charities like it are being used by Big Pharma to raise money under the auspices of a charitable organization who absorbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and development , and only intervening ( and then scooping up ) results once a profitable outcome is assured .\nLLS and other charities could and should take the next logical step and use the money they raise to create the facilities required to bring these breakthroughs to the people who need them most \u2013 at production cost , and with the knowledge used to create them provided as open source for the entire global medical community to use .\nThe fact that they have not , appears linked to their \u201c partnerships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commandeering their work .\nCreating a more transparent human healthcare system would be difficult to argue against .\nTreatments , cures , and our overall understanding of human health is funded by state and charity money .\nWho could argue that the knowledge , tools , techniques , treatments , and cures resulting from this public funding should not then be scooped-up by corrupt , untrustworthy , strictly-for-profit corporations who wall-off these breakthroughs with \u201c intellectual property ?\n\u201d Who besides the shareholders of these corrupt corporations would actually benefit ?\nIn solving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw from the successful resistance to other immensely corrupt industries .\nHealthcare isn \u2019 t the only industry deeply monopolized by corrupt corporations .\nTogether with Big Pharma is big-energy , big-agriculture , big-tech , the corporate media , and many others .\nThe battle against each of these rackets has spanned decades with people dedicating their whole lives to not only investigating and exposing them , but creating solutions to help undermine and eliminate them .\nThe battle against the corporate media is a good example of this .\nDecades ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the BBC or CNN one would need intensive capital , a newsroom full of reporters , a studio , cameras \u2013 all costing immense amounts of money and beyond the ability of the vast majority of the population .\nToday , information technology has made it possible for a single individual with minimum investment to reach thousands , tens of thousands , or even millions of people .\nWebsites , channels , and other forms of media have given way to a thriving alternative media ecosystem \u2013 a threat that has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporate media that a variety of strategies have been devised into what is now shaping into an information war .\nBig-tech has become involved \u2013 and here too we see a battle involving not only efforts to investigate and expose the stranglehold corporations like Google , Facebook , and Twitter attempt to gain over the flow of technology \u2013 but also viable alternatives to undermine and hopefully one day escape the reach of these online giants .\nBig-agriculture faces a growing global movement of localized organic agriculture who are pushing back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and their massive lobbying and disinformation networks .\nThese are all abusive industries that have not only strong , well-developed political and media resistance to them \u2013 but also abusive industries that can be undermined by tangible alternatives ordinary people can play a direct role in helping expand to prevail over them .\nHuman healthcare is different .\nBig Pharma \u2019 s role in the industry , just like the media decades ago , requires capital-intensive investments to build the labs and hire the staff to do even the simplest of related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of global healthcare infrastructure would probably be universities which include facilities to not only educate students for an eventual role within the healthcare system , but also facilities dedicated to research and development .\nHowever , universities have been significantly infiltrated by pharmaceutical corporations .\nA 2020 op-ed in the BMJ ( British Medical Journal ) titled , \u201c Conflict of interest in medicine : how medical students can become catalysts for change , \u201d would note : \u201c I was a fifth year medical student when I attended an elective seminar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conflict of interest in the medical profession.\n\u201d The speaker described several examples of the strategies the pharmaceutical industry uses to influence policies , research , and professional practice .\nIt was just a two hour event , but for me it was a turning point .\nDuring my clinical rotations in the following days , I started to notice the presence of pharmaceutical companies in the everyday life of health professionals\u2014from the contact with sales representatives , to the sponsored education materials , to the pens , notebooks , and other gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 office .\nUntil that moment , these practices were completely normal to me .\nDuring my medical training no one had ever told me to question them , or told me about the effect of industry influence on healthcare.\n\u201d The author , Alice Fabbri , would introduce the Just Medicine Campaign , described as advocating , \u201c conflict-free medical education environment , \u201d in a bid to remove the obvious and pervasive conflict of interest reaching into medical education ( and by implication , medical practice ) .\nThis malign influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical researchers and practitioners , and through a system of peer-pressure aided by Big Pharma \u2019 s extensive relationship with the corporate media \u2013 maintains a well-regulated system of veneration and devotion toward so-called \u201c scientific consensus \u201d created by and for industry interests , not actual science or the benefit of society .\nRaising awareness of this process at universities among medical students is one approach to help expose and possibly mitigate the malign influence pharmaceutical corporations have over global healthcare infrastructure and policy-making .\nBut it is not enough .\nTechnology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great equalizer between abusive monopolies and those seeking to diminish or eliminate their hold over our lives .\nTechnology will also by necessity need to be a key part in breaking Big Pharma \u2019 s hold over healthcare .\nIn the early 2000 \u2019 s the do-it-yourself biology ( DIYbio ) movement sprung up .\nIt focused on opening up the knowledge , tools , and techniques surrounding biotechnology .\nIt included the creation of open source hardware like lab equipment and diagnosis tools and also open source pharmaceuticals like the still-ongoing Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number of local community labs that began springing up around the globe .\nSome of them are still open , but most are not .\nFrom the very beginning big-pharma and its partners within Western governments identified and dealt swiftly with the threat of the DIYbio movement .\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) quickly established a \u201c relationship \u201d with many of these community labs across the United States and even tried to do so overseas .\nA National Institute of Health publication titled , \u201c The FBI and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would explain : \u201c In 2009 , the US Federal Bureau of Investigation came knocking on the door of the biohacking community : The agency sponsored a booth and workshop at the 2009 iGEM ( International Genetically Engineered Machine ) competition in Cambridge , MA , USA , and stood alongside US biohacking community leaders at a FBI\u2010sponsored synthetic biology conference \u201c Building Bridges Around Building Genomes \u201d held near San Francisco in 2010 .\nThe FBI acknowledged that their presence at and sponsorship of these conferences might seem unusual , with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We \u2019 re with the U.S. Government [ \u2026 ] and we \u2019 re here to help .\nReally.\n\u201d The abovementioned iGem competition had begun with an open source ethos but quickly turned into a poaching ground for large biotech and pharmaceutical corporations .\nCommunity labs , including one of the very first , GenSpace in New York City , were approached with corporate foundation funding and were quickly guided back into the same sort of devotion to corporate-determined \u201c scientific consensus \u201d encouraged on university campuses around the globe .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical tools was also a central pillar of the DIYbio movement .\nI personally ran a multi-year project developing open source solutions for a national children \u2019 s hospital in Bangkok , Thailand \u2013 creating custom designed solutions that were fabricated locally with 3D printers and used in place of more expensive and inflexible solutions from large biomedical companies .\nThe amount of money saved in just one year was enough to buy several 3D printers and \u2013 had the project been fully implemented \u2013 could have covered the cost of a full-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s innovation department .\nThe ultimate plan was to create a nationwide online network sharing open source designs in virtual 3D design warehouses like Thingiverse .\nThen , any hospital could download the design , fabricate it in-hospital and use it \u2013 cutting out large biomedical suppliers and increasing the speed of research , development , and iteration .\nThe potential for this type of project , coupled together with community labs and partnerships with truly public universities liberated from the malign influence of pharmaceutical giants could , just like local organic agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public with a foothold against an otherwise unstoppable and demonstrably dangerous corporate monopoly over global healthcare .\nThe possibility of this being a potential solution has prompted me to begin dusting off this project and begin working on it again \u2013 its purpose running parallel to my commitment to inform the public of the dangers of healthcare monopolies and the pharmaceutical industry , among other threats .\nThe DIYbio movement was clearly a potential threat to healthcare monopolies and thus a potential solution , but the number of individuals and communities involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentives for individuals and local communities to invest in these labs rather than selling out , strong enough .\nThe COVID-19 crisis and the irreparable damage it has done to our communities has raised awareness among many more people of not only the corruption of pharmaceutical giants , but the threat they pose to our everyday lives \u2013 a threat amply demonstrated since COVID-19 began appearing in headlines \u2013 and a threat that could ( and most likely will ) continue or expand well into the future .\nThe incentives may still not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take up the challenge of localizing healthcare in the same manner media and agriculture have \u2013 but maybe be enough for dedicated individuals aware of the danger pharmaceutical giants pose and fearful of a future where they are further empowered \u2013 to try a more principled and determined effort to establish community labs to either replace compromised university facilities or create sufficient public pressure to restore the independence of universities from pharmaceutical giants .\nFoundations modeled after highly successful open source software projects like Blender could potentially attract enough money and opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not only create breakthroughs like Dr. Carl June \u2019 s leukemia-curing CAR T-cell therapy , but prevent predatory pharmaceutical giants like Novartis from poaching public and charity-funded advances .\nInstead , these breakthroughs would be released to institutions globally as open source knowledge .\nCommunity labs would also possess the equipment and staff to verify claims made by agencies and institutions currently charged with announcing \u201c scientific consensus.\n\u201d Community labs would allow interested members of the public the opportunity to personally see the results of tests and research being done into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies creating greater public literacy as well as transparency .\nThe narrative surrounding COVID-19 would not have been allowed to be monopolized the way it has if the public had a viable alternative to the current completely controlled healthcare system that prevails globally .\nIt is essential that the alternative media continues investigating and exposing the abuses of those dominating the COVID-19 narrative , and separate real science from profiteering corporations guilty of serial abuses trying to hide behind the banner of \u201c The Science \u201d and a purported \u201c scientific consensus.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations by creating a real alternative , however local and small it starts out as , is equally important and central to long-term success .\nWithout an alternative that is clearly superior to what we are being left with at the moment , the general public will continue to cave to the pressure and panic deliberately placed on them by the massive influence these corporations exercise through the mainstream media .\nIf you have skill sets in anything ranging from coding , 3D design , fabrication , biotechnology , or medicine , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this alternative .\nIt will be difficult , with steep learning curves , risks , and personal investments required , but as we \u2019 ve witnessed over the past year and a half now \u2013 do we really have any other option but to take this next critical step \u2013 and begin rebuilding the DIYbio movement with new impetus and extra guard against infiltration and being co-opted

"source": "21stcenturywire", "title": "Bibi, Biden and Trump: Do Palestinian Lives Matter?", "content": "Seven years ago , Benjamin Netanyahu ( aka Bibi ) unleashed a more than a \u201c month long campaign of destruction and devastation of the Gaza Strip , \u201d even naming the genocidal exercise quasi-poetically and blatantly ironically , Operation Protective Edge ( 8 July\u201326 August 2014 ) .\nIn comparison , the recent military campaign against the Palestinians appears rather benign .\nThis year \u2019 s 11-day military assault on the world \u2019 s largest open-air prison , colloquially known as Gaza has now come to an end ( 10-21 May 2021 ) .\nThe end results are clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIncluding 66 children and 39 women .\nAt least 1,910 wounded.\n\u2019 And more \u2018 than 90,000 Palestinians displaced , \u2019 as tweeted by the English-language news channel Al Jazeera .\nMeanwhile , 12 people in Israel have also been killed , including two children , one Indian woman as well as two Thai men living and working in Israel .\nThe fact that the Palestinian resistance organization Hamas started firing rockets into Israel proper remains beyond doubt , but the Israeli leadership and its settler cohorts had been provoking the displaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starting on 13 April 2021 , coinciding with the first day of the Muslim month of Ramadan dedicated to fasting , praying and sleeping , Israeli police raided the Haram al Sharif [ Temple Mount ] in Jerusalem , proceeding to cut the loudspeaker cables used to broadcast the al\u2013Aqsa mosque \u2019 s call to prayer ( adhan ) .\nThis clear act of provocation has to be seen in conjunction with the ongoing violence surrounding the adjacent East Jerusalem area of Sheikh Jarrah \u2013 called \u2018 property disputes between Palestinians and Israelis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the expulsion of Palestinian families from their homes by Israeli settlers , in plain English .\nIn the meantime , the Israeli state continued its provocative attacks on the al\u2013Aqsa , which is not just an important mosque for Palestinians locally but to all Muslims worldwide as the site of Muhammad \u2019 s legendary night journey to Heaven ( Isr\u0101 \u2019 and Mi \u2019 r\u0101j ) .\nIn response to Bibi \u2019 s seemingly wanton acts of provocation , \u2018 Hamas had demanded that [ Israel ] pull all troops from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Temple Mount in Jerusalem by 6 PM [ on 10 May 2021 ] .\nHamas also called on Israel to free all Arabs detained for rioting in Jerusalem by that time.\n\u2019 Early on that very day , the Israeli police stormed the al\u2013Aqsa , \u201c firing stun grenades and tear gas and clashing with Palestinians inside following days of worsening clashes.\n\u201d This provocative attack followed by an expected non-compliance to the ultimatum on the part of the Israeli authorities , led the Palestinian resistance organization to fire seven rockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday evening , right as the ultimatum .\n.\n.\nexpired .\nOne of the rockets was intercepted by the Iron Dome system , \u2019 as related by Arutz Sheva ( Israel National News , in English ) , an Israeli media network identifying with religious Zionism .\nBibi took this as his invitation to start all-out war on Gaza .\nThe Wall Street Journal \u2018 s Felicia Schwartz and Dov Lieber explain that \u201c Israel carried out airstrikes in Palestinian territory after militants in Gaza fired a barrage of rockets at Jerusalem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n.\nThe targets included eight Hamas operatives and a Hamas terror tunnel .\nIsrael also bolstered its troops on the border with Gaza.\n\u201d And that was the first day of the 11-day military assault on Gaza .\nThe Israeli PM then told the press that the \u201c current conflict could continue for some time .\nWe do not seek escalation but whoever chooses to escalate will feel the weight of our arm , \u201d indicating that the current military action would be nothing but a Blitzkrieg rather than a serious named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning behind this 11-day Blitzkrieg seem beyond easy comprehension .\nThe Jerusalem Post correspondent , Dr Seth Frantzman suggested on Twitter that this whole episode was all about Bibi \u2019 s electoral failure and his desire to cling to power and distract from his court case : \u201c The Chairman of the Yamina party , \u201c [ Naftali ] Bennett in Israel who was working to form a government with Lapid says he will go back to Netanyahu and Likud , [ and therefore , ] the recent violence [ effectively ] defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c one might find [ this ] a bit suspicious given the timing.\n\u201d Throughout these eleven days , the world had been watching the events in Israel and Gaza in awe and disbelief .\nOne could argue that the Middle East has now once more reasserted its place at the forefront of the world \u2019 s attention , at the forefront of U.S. foreign policy .\nPresident Trump fully supported Israel and its beleaguered leader Benjamin Netanyahu over the past four years ; and , the relatively fresh Biden administration was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the Far East instead : China is \u201c deadly earnest on becoming the most significant , consequential nation in the world , \u201d is what President Biden said last month ( 28 April 2021 ) , only to add : But now Bibi has thrown a spanner in the works and the world is once again watching the bloodshed in the so-called Holy Land .\nRather than building back better ; and , treating the \u201c Israeli-Palestinian conflict \u201d as \u201c a much less urgent matter , \u201d as worded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden administration is back in the middle of a foreign policy issue \u201c which has bedeviled generations of American presidents.\n\u201d As Woke-in-Chief , Joe Biden and his VP Harris were all about diversity , inclusion and equity ( aka # DIE ) , they wanted to change America for the better and take the world along for the ride .\nAnd their chosen slogan possessed a sound pedigree , as expressed by Drs Ksenia Chmutina and Wesley Cheek : the phrase Build Back Better \u201c was found floating around the international development/post-disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 Indian Ocean tsunami.\n\u201d At the time , Bill Clinton penned a United Nations Report entitled Key Propositions for Building Back Better .\nAbout a decade and a half later , Biden and/or his advisers/mentors picked up this catchy phrase to re-fashion the world ( or rather \u2018 America \u2019 ) according to the specifications of newly-minted fashionable ideas and slogans : \u201c Building back better means an updated social contract that treats American workers and working families as essential at all times , not just times of crisis .\n.\n.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entrepreneurs come out the other side of this crisis strong , while demanding more from corporate America.\n\u201d President Biden \u2019 s mantra does sound a lot like his predecessor \u2019 s slogan Make America Great Again ( # MAGA ) ; but , in order to quickly dispell any such impressions he equally quickly told the world that \u201c America is back , the transatlantic alliance is back , \u201d while speaking to the annual Munich Security Conference virtually last February .\nQuite logically now , the People \u2019 s Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict .\nIts foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying declaring the following on 14 May 2021 : \u201c What we can feel is that the U.S. keeps saying that it cares about the human rights of Muslims .\n.\n.\nbut it was ignoring the suffering of the Palestinian people.\n\u201d On the one hand , China thereby all but reaffirms its stance in the New Cold War realignments , while taunting Biden in his desire to concentrate on China even as he now has to deal with Palestine .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull Biden to the left : Ilhan Omar , Rashida Tlaib , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez put direct pressure the White House to take a more sympathetic line regarding the Palestinian plight .\nBefore the end of the 11-day war , \u201c President Biden [ had ] held six phone calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , one with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and one with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\u201d From Tel Aviv , the Israeli journalist and commentator Barak Ravid explains that President \u201c Biden told his top advisers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with the crisis through intense but quiet diplomacy with Israel and Egypt , \u201d as if replaying Obama \u2019 s strategy of leading from behind though the latter never really seems to have uttered such a phrase .\nWhile the President was frantically working behind the scenes , Biden \u2019 s America had nevertheless undergone some important changes , changes that have come into place as a result of the power and influence of the Black Lives Matter ( # BLM ) movement and its political allies .\nOn \u2018 Nakba Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Palestinian Catastrophe which is the declaration of the state of Israel on 15 May , across the U.S. demonstrations took place in major cities \u2013 Los Angeles , New York , Boston , Philadelphia , Atlanta and others .\nThe Associated Press ( AP ) reported that in \u2018 Atlanta , hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators , including grandparents , teenagers and mothers and fathers with youngsters in tow , assembled downtown to wave signs and chant slogans .\n.\n.\nOne sign read , \u201c We can \u2019 t breathe since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial injustice and police brutality protests in the U.S. during the past year in the wake of George Floyd \u2019 s death.\n\u2019 In this way , the hashtag BLM had suddenly become \u2018 PLM \u2019 or Palestinian Lives Matter .\nWhile on American television screens hitherto unheard words and phrases were being broadcast .\nThe 22-year old Palestinian \u201c writer and a poet \u201d Mohammed el-Kurd \u2019 namely appeared on CNN and MSNBC ( 11 May 2021 ) .\nThe young man quite self-assuredly called the Israeli attacks on Gaza a \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah , \u201c ethnic cleansing.\n\u201d He even stated that Israel \u201c came about by stealing people \u2019 s homes and stealing people \u2019 s lands , stealing people \u2019 s villages.\n\u201d Arguably , this was the first time ever American television viewers heard such words .\nThe mood in the U.S. has now clearly changed .\nThe public opinion pollster John Zogby simply says that \u201c [ t ] he shift is dramatic ; it \u2019 s tectonic ; \u201d adding that \u201c [ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly among Democrats , who are very sensitive to the treatment of fellow non-whites.\n\u201d Zogby even made this incredible following statement : these non-white Americans , \u201c [ t ] hey see Israel as an aggressor.\n\u201d After all , Biden as Woke-in-Chief has ensured that his administration is more diverse than ever , more non-white than ever .\nAnd now , this newly acquired sensitivity is slowly gaining ground in the wider population of the United States .\nPart of this shift can be credited to the emergence of \u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led by a trio of Congresswomen \u2013 Palestinian-American Rashida Tlaib of Michigan , and Somalian refugee Ilhan Omar of Minnesota , and the popular outspoken representative from New York , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez .\nThe BBC recently acknowledged this change in Congressional demographics as one of the factors which is nudging US opinion away from its previously hardened policy positions : Bibi and Biden : A Love Affair in the Making ?\n!\n?\n?\nBenyamin Netanyahu may have had many reasons to initiate this latest bout of violence against the Palestinians living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have reasoned that this latest flare-up would have negative consequences for Biden , thereby aiding his personal friend and ally , Donald J. Trump .\nAfter all , both men for four years had a \u201c mutually beneficial relationship , \u201d as worded by the AP .\nA former Israeli consul-general in New York , Alon Pinkas , even said at the time that \u201c [ t ] hey [ meaning Bibi and Trump ] see eye to eye.\n\u201d After all , Bibi did say that Trump was \u201c the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House.\n\u201d As a result , it would seem conceivable that the Israeli PM intended to help his friend and ally \u2019 s party in the upcoming mid-terms and Trump \u2019 s possible presidential run in 2024 .\nBut Bibi had clearly not counted on the wider # BLM effect in the U.S. And Biden showed himself to be an adept mover and shaker behind the scenes .\nRather than weakening the Democrat \u2019 s hand , Biden seems to have proven his mettle .\nIn the end , Netanyahu still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden \u2019 s position and credibility do not seem to have been weakened by the recent events .\nIn fact , the U.S. President has now even rewarded Bibi following the cessation of hostilities : At the same time , \u2018 President Biden said his administration is working with Palestinians and Israelis to work toward a sustained calm , adding that both deserve to live in safety and security , \u2019 as reported by the news agency Reuters .\nAnd now ( 24 May 2021 ) , the President has even dispatched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a hands-on intervention during a three-day trip .\nAnthony Blinken will be in Israel , but next will also visit the Palestinian Territories , Egypt and Jordan .\nBefore boarding his plane , Blinken went on CNN to make this statement : That means , Joe Biden is now trying to perform a cunning manoeuvre that is meant to keep the Israeli and Palestinian sides happy , while placating his white as well as his now arguably more important non-white public at home .\nAs a self-confessed Zionist , Biden \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , as the Woke-in-Chief , he must also try to further a now newly-emerged \u2018 PLM \u2019 agenda that dovetails with his progressive and non-white base .\nAs reported by the AP : Whether President Biden will fail or succeed remains to be seen , but the fact that U.S. public opinion now seems to be reassessing America \u2019 s relationship with Israel will only grow stronger and deeper as time goes by .\n.\n.\nand time will also undoubtedly tell whether

Michigan now : Is Gretchen Whitmer the Andrew Cuomo of the Midwest ?\nIt is no coincidence that two of the worst coronavirus outbreaks took place in states that failed to protect their vulnerable elderly populations .\nBoth New York Gov .\nAndrew Cuomo and Michigan Gov .\nGretchen Whitmer passed policies forcing nursing homes to accept COVID-19-positive patients during the early days of the pandemic , and both states suffered as a result .\nCuomo has rightly come under immense scrutiny for not only passing this disastrous nursing home policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by downplaying the true coronavirus death toll in New York \u2019 s nursing homes .\nWhitmer , however , has largely escaped criticism .\nIt \u2019 s time that changed .\nA new report by Deadline Detroit \u2019 s Charlie LeDuff suggests Whitmer , like Cuomo , severely undercounted the coronavirus deaths in Michigan \u2019 s long-term care facilities .\nBut unlike Cuomo \u2019 s administration , Whitmer \u2019 s seems to have no idea whatsoever just how many nursing home residents died as a result of COVID-19 , LeDuff said .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health department refused to require nursing homes to report coronavirus deaths publicly .\nInstead , long-term care facilities were asked to self-report all coronavirus deaths .\nBut those numbers were never verified by state officials .\nThe state did conduct a study last summer with a limited sample to determine whether its vital records , meaning , records of life events kept under governmental authority , such as birth certificates , marriage licenses , and death certificates , included nursing home residents .\nOf the 1,468 vital records sampled from March 2020 through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were traced back to long-term care facilities , LeDuff reported .\nThis means that during that time period , nearly half of all deaths in the state occurred in the state \u2019 s nursing homes .\nWhitmer \u2019 s decision to send coronavirus patients into those facilities almost certainly contributed to that death toll .\nThe problem is we might never know for sure just how many Michigan nursing home residents died during the pandemic because state health officials stopped reviewing vital records \u201c due to how time-consuming it is and the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this , \u201d according to Bob Wheaton , a spokesman for Michigan \u2019 s Department of Health and Human Services .\nMichigan state legislators ought to follow New York \u2019 s example and demand a thorough investigation into this report .\nIt matters a great deal whether Whitmer \u2019 s nursing home policy unnecessarily cost the lives of elderly Michiganders , and the state must be able to identify how many people were affected so that it can adequately weigh the costs of Whitmer \u2019 s decision .\nOur government leaders must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 ve passed , especially when those policies cost the lives of thousands of vulnerable citizens .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR

\u201d as a new disease , the U.S. government has subsidized the pharmaceutical industry by funding its vaccine \u2018 research \u2019 to the tune of more than $ 9 billion , along with another $ 22 billion spent to support the experimental vaccines \u2019 distribution , before finally spending a further $ 10 billion to expand vaccine markets for the pharmaceutical jabs .\nIf that \u2019 s not enough , the Federal government has now announced it will spend a further $ 3 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales of the experimental vaccines and mRNA genetic injections \u2013 which the government is promoting under the banner of \u201c combating vaccine hesitancy.\n\u201d \u2022 The government funded vaccine research to the tune of more than $ 9 billion , spent $ 22 billion to support vaccine distribution , shelled out another $ 10 billion to expand access and currently announced $ 3 billion to spend on an ad campaign to combat vaccine hesitancy .\n\u2022 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services launched a grassroots campaign engaging leaders in your community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encourage more people to get vaccinated in addition to a news media blitz in the last 18 months about the virus and vaccine .\n\u2022 The government paid for the development of the vaccine , for the advertising and for your vaccination to support a for-profit industry whose revenue from the COVID-19 vaccine program continues to mount .\nThe White House is pouring taxpayer money into free advertising for a booming and liability-free vaccine industry , which doesn \u2019 t seem quite right .\nSince the beginning of human existence , greed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption of man .\nThe phrase \u201c follow the money \u201d was popularized in the film , \u201c All the President \u2019 s Men , \u201d a docudrama about the break-in at the Watergate office building and the subsequent political scandal that ultimately brought down the presidency of Richard Nixon .\nThe movie , based on the nonfiction book by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward , suggests that by following the money , political corruption will be exposed .\nIn the past 18 months , there \u2019 s been so much money promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the COVID pandemic that it \u2019 s difficult to tease out the origins .\nThe amounts of money reported in the news or announced by government agencies are so large it \u2019 s easy to believe the pot of money is endless .\nYet , that pot of money is funded through your tax dollars , and those tax dollars have plummeted in the last 18 months as more and more businesses closed , shutting more and more people out of a paycheck .\nIn comparison , in 2008 , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average unemployment rate was 5.8 % .\nBut in 2020 the jobless rate rose to a record high of 14.7 % and one year later is still above the 2008 recession rate , averaging 6.1 % in April 2021 .\nAs a comparison , the average unemployment rate before the pandemic , in 2018 , was 3.9 % .\nAlthough these seem like small percentage differences , they represent large numbers of people and sums of money that were not being paid in taxes .\nFor example , 5.8 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ) was 17.6 million people not working and contributing to the tax pool ; 6.1 % of the population in 2020 was 20.17 million people .\nIn 2018 , the average tax bill in the U.S. was $ 15,322 , which means if you do the math , the U.S. was short $ 309 billion in tax money in 2020 .\n$ 3 Billion in free advertising goes to Big Pharma In January 2021 , the Department of Health and Human Services announced $ 22 billion to support expanded testing and vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House announced they would spend another $ 10 billion to expand access to vaccines and \u201c build confidence \u201d in them in designated areas .\nTwelve days later , April 6 , 2021 , the CDC announced they would again dip into taxpayer money through Washington \u2019 s Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act to spend $ 3 billion to support an \u201c ad campaign to combat vaccine hesitancy.\n\u201d In the CDC announcement they said the money would fund \u201c innovative partnerships with community-based organizations to increase vaccine uptake.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t there been enough free publicity in the news and on television about the pandemic and the \u201c need \u201d for vaccination to return to \u201c normal \u201d ?\nThe advertisements were played on network TV and cable throughout April 2021 in English and Spanish in the hope they would reduce vaccine hesitancy as \u201c skepticism about the vaccines also remains high.\n\u201d Yet , as the National Vaccine Information Center points out , you only have to turn on the evening news on any major television network in the U.S. to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffrey Zients , White House COVID-19 response coordinator , commented in a press briefing about the $ 3 billion being used to bolster information about the COVID vaccine in communities , \u201c Building vaccine confidence and increasing access to vaccination is central to our efforts.\n\u201d At the beginning of the pandemic , major drug companies were funded with taxpayer dollars to develop COVID vaccines to the tune of more than $ 9 billion .\nThey were then handed a liability shield , which ensured if the product did not work or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company was shielded from any lawsuits .\nIn other words , the vaccine industry was given billions of dollars to develop a vaccine , then shielded from any liability if their vaccines didn \u2019 t work or if they hurt people .\nNext , the government poured billions more taxpayer dollars into advertising those vaccines and spreading information that might help people to decide to get the vaccines .\nIt is important to note that the government is providing the vaccine free of charge to you regardless of your health insurance status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost to the government per dose for COVID-19 vaccines was : So , added to the billions already given to the vaccine companies to develop the vaccine , free advertising for their product through the news media and billions poured into increasing access to their product \u2014 plus additional paid ad campaigns \u2014 all paid for by the government , vaccine companies are now charging the government for each individual dose they deliver .\nThis may make the COVID-19 vaccine the best return on investment for drug development and sale in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and effort being poured into vaccinating as many people as possible in the shortest time possible doesn \u2019 t stop there .\nIn early April 2021 , the Department of Health and Human Services launched a grassroots ad campaign for the COVID vaccine industry called the COVID-19 Community Corps .\nThis is a group of leaders within communities that \u201c people know and trust , \u201d whose goal is to encourage Americans to get vaccinated .\nThe group was invited to : \u201c \u2026 receive timely , accurate information to share with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By encouraging them to get vaccinated , you \u2019 ll help protect them \u2014 and allow all of us to safely gather together again.\n\u201d The New York Times reported that 275 organizations had signed up for the COVID-19 Community Corps by mid-May 2021 , including the Catholic Health Association , the North American Meat Institute and NASCAR .\nIt \u2019 s expected that many of the Catholic and evangelical groups will work at a community level to address the concerns surrounding the use of abortion-derived fetal cell lines in the Johnson & @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to debunk this concern using general terms , the answer lies in the technicalities of how the cell lines have been used , as detailed in \u201d Several COVID-19 Vaccines Are Made Using Aborted Fetal Cells.\n\u201d The general terms that self-declared fact-checkers like to use when rating something false or misleading is in fact , false and misleading .\nThere have been cell lines commonly used in vaccine development that originated from aborted fetuses .\nSeveral vaccine makers used at least one of these cell lines in the development of COVID-19 vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & Johnson .\nOne argument for using fetal cell lines during the production of vaccines is the claim that the cells are clones of the original .\nThis is like saying your 20-year-old or 40-year-old body is no longer your body since all the cells are copies of those when you were a baby .\nThey are , in essence , a clone of the original .\nHowever , there is virtually no difference between cells that grow and multiply in a petri dish and those that grow and multiply in your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your body are still you , then the cells in the petri dish are still those of the original aborted fetus .\nThe government agency reasons given for the slowdown in vaccinations , which threatens to create a situation where supply exceeds demand for the vaccine , are superficial .\nThe New York Times quotes Shirley Bloomfield , chief executive of NTCA \u2014 The Rural Broadband Association as saying : \u201c I \u2019 ve got some pockets where they cite religious reasons with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine .\nThere are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had COVID and a sense of , \u2018 Well , we \u2019 ve all already gotten it , so we \u2019 re not really pressed.\n\u2019 \u201d In early May 2021 , the White House announced that 100 million people in the U.S. were fully vaccinated .\nAccording to a reporter from The Hill , \u201c Authorities need to dispel the legitimate concerns that make people hesitant , while also stopping waves of misinformation.\n\u201d How do you dispel concerns that are legitimate without using your own misinformation ?\nThe news media appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on their political affiliation , continuing to cite Trump supporters as those who might want to create chaos around vaccinations .\nYet , according to a recent poll reported in The Hill , only 30 % of Republicans said they would not get the vaccine , and only 35 % of the U.S. is fully vaccinated .\nAs the number who are willing to get jabbed by a genetic experiment begins to wane , it \u2019 s difficult to justify how vaccine hesitancy can fall along political lines .\nTo put this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. population now identifies as Republican , and 30 % of those said they would not get the vaccine .\nIf politics were a significant factor for vaccine hesitancy , then only 12 % of the U.S. population would not be willing to be vaccinated .\nSome of the reasons being cited for an unwillingness to take an experimental vaccine include some of the side effects without talking about the side effects , potential safety without describing why there may be safety issues and a belief that COVID-19 isn \u2019 t a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hesitating are downplayed and countered .\nWho has more medical knowledge \u2014 Joe Rogan or Bill Gates ?\nIn a slightly comedic turn of events , Dr. Anthony Fauci and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield questioned radio blogger Joe Rogan \u2019 s medical knowledge after he made comments in his popular podcast that young people likely didn \u2019 t need to be vaccinated , which he possibly based on these facts : \u2022 The CDC states : \u201c Children and adolescents have had lower incidence and fewer severe COVID-19 outcomes than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.8 % required ICU admission , and < 0.1 % died.\n\u201d \u2022 The vaccine may not prevent you from getting COVID-19 but reduces your symptoms .\n\u2022 Researchers are not sure if you can spread COVID-19 after vaccination .\nThis means young people are not at significant risk for severe disease and death .\nSince the vaccine may not prevent a mild to moderate illness in this age group and the vaccine may not prevent transmission , Rogan \u2019 s statement doesn \u2019 t seem like misinformation .\nYet , Bedingfield told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medical doctor while we weren \u2019 t looking ?\nI \u2019 m not sure that taking scientific and medical advice from Joe Rogan is perhaps the most productive way for people to get their information.\n\u201d The same question could be asked of Bill or Melinda Gates .\nDid either of them become doctors when we weren \u2019 t looking ?\nYet , Gates : \u2022 Is called the \u201c world \u2019 s most powerful doctor \u201d in reference to his influence over the World Health Organization , years before the COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Economic Forum in October 2019 , which was a highly predictive novel coronavirus pandemic exercise of the events that transpired over the coming 12 months .\n\u2022 Set up , and influences the actions of GAVI , the Vaccine Alliance , with a grant of $ 750 million to start and a subsequent infusion of $ 50 million in 2020 ; GAVI claims they are a key partner in shaping the vaccine market across the world .\nGovernment officials are crying out over the dissemination of \u201c misinformation \u201d surrounding COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have the audacity to use their First Amendment rights to free speech .\nPublic health experts , while being allowed their own opinions , said Rogan \u2019 s comments could perpetuate vaccine hesitancy .\nBut they didn \u2019 t stop there .\nGeorges Benjamin , the executive director of the American Public Health Association , told Rogan , \u201c You have a responsibility as an adult , you have a responsibility as a community leader , your responsibility as a communicator to get it right.\n\u201d He later went on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : \u201c I just think they have to speak the facts .\nYou speak the facts , and anytime you discover the facts that are incorrect , you try to correct them .\nAnd \u2026 I don \u2019 t think you demonize the individual , nor do I think you try to pin motive to it , because you don \u2019 t know what the motive is.\n\u201d In other words , he implied that Rogan was acting like a child and an irresponsible community leader , but those who are \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be derided or demeaned since \u201c you don \u2019 t know what the motive is.\n\u201d In other words , the objective is to \u201c try to correct \u201d the information .\nThese are the insidious ways that anyone with an opposing opinion who does not align with the desired rhetoric is discredited .\nIt \u2019 s an effective technique that uses a deep understanding of psychology to sway your beliefs and your opinions .\nIt is vital at this time in history to read the information and make up your own mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to the \u201c experts , \u201d many don \u2019 t have your individual best interest in mind and are likely leading people down a primrose path to a future

and playwright C.J .\nHopkins describes the current pandemic paradigm as a worrying prelude to the normalization of a brutal technocratic brand of authoritarianism .\nAs millions of vaccines are distributed around the world each day , mask mandates are lifted , and daily life takes on a semblance of normalcy , one German-based satirist is ringing the alarm bells about what he views as \u201c nascent totalitarianism \u201d seeping its way into society .\nC.J .\nHopkins is an American playwright and author living in Berlin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Over the past year and a half , Hopkins has been increasingly concerned about long-term implications of what he deemed the \u201c radical restructuring of human society \u201d toward a post-COVID \u201c New Normal , \u201d a term often used by the political class .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a free speech advocate , against racism , discrimination \u2013 anti-authoritarian , basically .\nAnd watching our societies transform into this type of authoritarianism , and I go so far as to call it nascent totalitarianism , is horrifying , \u201d Hopkins said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEE ALSO : Greetings from \u201c New Normal \u201d Germany !\nWhile Hopkins \u2019 ideological beliefs have aligned with the political left more often than not throughout his career , he has never been one to silently fall in line .\nIn fact , Hopkins has been openly critical of the lies and deceit coming from the left since the election of President Donald Trump in 2016 .\n\u201c It was fascinating to watch and track the reaction of the establishment to Donald Trump .\nHe became a figurehead for this populist push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Hopkins .\nThis \u201c global capitalist ideology \u201d he described , or \u201c GloboCap \u201d as he \u2019 s taken to calling it in his writings , is an ideologically monolithic global-capitalist societal structure .\nEssentially , a ruling class made up of globalist oligarchs .\n\u201c It was just so clear they set out to destroy him , make an example of him , and demonize everybody who put him in office , \u201d said Hopkins .\nHe claimed the demonization of Trump during his four years in office was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s in charge and what happens if we elect unauthorized presidents who haven \u2019 t been approved by the system.\n\u201d Admittedly not a fan of Trump , Hopkins couldn \u2019 t help but laugh at all of the ways in which the former president was vilified .\n\u201c First , he was a Russian intelligence asset , then he was literally Hitler and was going to overthrow the U.S. government with some underground White supremacist militia , \u201d Hopkins recalled , claiming the accusations were \u201c pure fantasy that was taken seriously.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a post-COVID \u201c New Normal \u201d society in which people are willing to lockdown in their homes when told , wear masks when asked , and carry around their COVID-19 vaccination cards in order to be allowed into public spaces is a continuation of the invisible ruling class asserting its dominance .\n\u201c One thing that I \u2019 ve been saying to try to get through to people , \u201d said Hopkins , \u201c is just the whole idea of lockdowns .\n\u2018 Lockdown , \u2019 this is a prison term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the prison ?\nWhen the prisoners are rioting and getting rebellious .\nIt \u2019 s a way of reminding everyone , \u2018 Hey , you \u2019 re in prison and we \u2019 re in charge . '\n\u201d \u201c It isn \u2019 t really about the vaccines or the tests , \u201d he said in regards to newly implemented guidelines .\n\u201c What it \u2019 s about is training us , conditioning us to live in a society where we accept this type of control.\n\u201d Another aspect of this \u201c synchronization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and which he finds particularly terrifying is the ideological uniformity being spread by \u201c big supranational entities and corporate media \u201d on behalf of the establishment .\n\u201c It \u2019 s tearing societies apart , it \u2019 s tearing relationships apart , it \u2019 s tearing families apart , this extreme polarization and intolerance of dissent and differing views , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I feel like if I start questioning or challenging the official COVID narrative , if I start pointing out facts , I \u2019 m treated like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scientology.\n\u201d \u201c The reaction is not one of strong disagreement , anger or to prove me wrong , \u201d he continued .\n\u201c The reaction is to shut me up , silence me and make me go away .\nWhen a society gets to that place , where dissent is treated that way , that is a really dangerous development.\n\u201d Hopkins compared the \u201c suffocating \u201d atmosphere in Berlin to a German word , Gleichschaltung , which arose in the Nazi era and was used to describe the process by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control over the individual , as well as close coordination of all aspects of society .\nAll is not doomed , however , according to the American political satirist , who said he has been greatly encouraged by the pushback exhibited in parts of the U.S. , naming states like Florida and Texas .\nSadly , no such rebellion against the shift toward totalitarianism exists in Germany .\nAs an artist and a creature of the left , speaking out about the left wing \u2019 s authoritarian power grab has been particularly painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 m an artist and 99 % of the art world has just gone completely \u2018 New Normal , \u2019 \u201d he said , admitting many of his personal relationships have been ruined by him sharing his unpopular opinions .\n\u201c Most often I get attacked by folks on the left and liberals who are now telling me that I \u2019 m some kind of far-right extremist , but I haven \u2019 t changed.\n\u201d For Hopkins , remaining silent and falling into line is no longer an option .\n\u201c There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put those types of career considerations and personal considerations aside because the stakes are that high , and I feel like the stakes are that high this time.\n\u201d *** C.J .\nHopkins is an award-winning American playwright , novelist and political satirist , and is author of the dystopian classic , Zone 23 .\nHis plays have been

.\nThis was not because they truly believed the elections weren \u2019 t \u201c free and fair , \u201d but simply because there is no possibility for their client regime of choice to come to power .\nThis is despite these same Western nations \u2013 hand-in-hand \u2013 lecturing the world about \u201c democracy , \u201d and using its alleged \u201c lacking \u201d as a pretext to interfere in

West is placing on Syrians to likewise inhibit their ability to vote .\nAP in an article titled , \u201c Lebanese attack Syrian voters in sign of growing resentment , \u201d The same AP article would

ongoing conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would claim : Syria has been engulfed in civil war since 2011 , when Arab Spring-inspired protests against the Assad family rule turned into an armed insurgency in response to a brutal military crackdown .\nIt is this fundamental lie that is used to not only justify the latest round of suppressing Syrian voters , but Western intervention in Syria altogether.AP would claim : Yet since as early as 2011 the Western media has piecemeal admitted to the US-engineered nature of both the so-called \u201c Arab Spring \u201d and the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militants flooding into the country , not \u201c rising up \u201d from within .\nThe New York Times in a 2011 article titled , \u201c U.S .\nGroups Helped Nurture Arab Uprisings , \u201d would admit : A number of the groups and individuals directly involved in the revolts and reforms sweeping the region , including the April 6 Youth Movement in Egypt , the Bahrain Center for Human Rights and grass-roots activists like Entsar Qadhi , a youth leader in Yemen , received training and financing from groups like the International Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedom House , a nonprofit human rights organization based in Washington , according to interviews in recent weeks and American diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks .\nThe same article would also admit that many of the \u201c youth leaders \u201d involved in the initial protests had been trained and backed by US tech firms like Google and Facebook as well as the US State Department itself since as early as 2008 .\nAs early as 2012 , not even a year into the conflict , the Western media was regularly admitting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting the Syrian government and the fact that militant leadership , training programs , and the shipment of arms was being done beyond Syria \u2019 s borders \u2013 not within them .\nReuters in its 2012 article , \u201c Obama authorizes secret support for Syrian rebels , \u201d would admit : President Barack Obama has signed a secret order authorizing U.S. support for rebels seeking to depose Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his government , sources familiar with the matter said .\nThe article also admitted , regarding Turkey : Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia and Qatar , Turkey had established a secret base near the Syrian border to help direct vital military and communications support to Assad \u2019 s opponents .\nThis \u201c nerve center \u201d is in Adana , a city in southern Turkey about 60 miles from the Syrian border , which is also home to Incirlik , a U.S. air base where U.S. military and intelligence agencies maintain a substantial presence .\nThus it is abundantly clear that Syria \u2019 s conflict was never an actual civil war .\nIt was a war @

evidence to the 54th session of the Stiftung Corona Ausschuss , the German-based extraparliamentary inquiry by lawyers into the medical establishment \u2019 s and public policymakers \u2019 handling of the Covid crisis internationally .\nThe theme for the day during the 54th session was \u201c Caught between nudging and side effects \u201d .\nA transcript of my testimony is below .\nAuch auf Deutsch erh\u00e4ltlich .\nReiner F\u00fcllmich : Brian , I apologise for having kept you waiting for twenty minutes or so .\nBrian Gerrish : That \u2019 s absolutely fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that I don \u2019 t speak German but it was fascinating watching you and listening , and it was wonderful to see you start laughing , because you looked very serious in most of the dialogues that I \u2019 ve listened to .\nThere was one word that I picked up that I found very interesting , and that was Wahnsinn , which came up several times , particularly when [ persecuted primary school headmistress ] Bianca was speaking .\nReiner F\u00fcllmich : You know what it means , right ?\nBrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd I \u2019 m going to say to you : it \u2019 s not madness .\nWhat we are facing is calculated , and it \u2019 s a mistake to call it \u201c madness \u201d , because it \u2019 s very precise ; it \u2019 s very calculated .\nWe need to understand that in order to be able to deal with what we \u2019 re facing .\nReiner F\u00fcllmich : That \u2019 s very interesting to hear , because we have come to the conclusion that \u201c the other side \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using two major tools .\nOne is , of course , psychology , psychological operations ; and the other , which transports this psychological operation , is the mainstream media .\nCan you tell us a little about your background ?\nBrian Gerrish : Well , my personal background is , professionally , I was military : I was in the Royal Navy for twenty-one years .\nI then worked in industry , essentially , for a while , but after a few years , I began to understand that things were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to see things and investigate things .\nUltimately , that \u2019 s led me , over nearly another twenty years , to team up with a gentleman called Mike Robinson , and for fourteen years now , we \u2019 ve been running a media outlet called the UK Column , where I \u2019 m delighted to say that we \u2019 re expanding , and it \u2019 s clear that our viewers and listeners are now not only in the UK ; they \u2019 re across the world .\nReiner F\u00fcllmich : Excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re busy covering Coronavirus and all the ramifications of what Coronavirus is bringing about .\nBrian Gerrish : Well , the key point is that we originally started by looking at some of the issues that you \u2019 ve just mentioned .\nWe we were looking at how propaganda had come into the country ; we were looking at the use of applied behavioural psychology by the Government ; and we were looking at changes which were very serious ( or we thought they were very serious ) that were particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were also affecting our constitutional rights .\nIt was against that background of reporting that we have then encountered , obviously , what \u2019 s happened with Coronavirus .\nSo I would say to you that our analysis of what has happened with Coronavirus is seen very much against the background of what was happening politically , and in particular the use of applied behavioural psychology and propaganda .\nViviane Fischer : So what do you think is the \u201c calculated madness \u201d ?\nThe [ description ] \u201c madness \u201d is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what was the normal status of things before .\nNo-one would have thought , had you asked us a year ago , that this could have ever happened ; at least not us , I guess .\nAnd also , we were really surprised how the legal system has deteriorated , or at least , how it has become obvious that it is really in bad shape .\nBut we also have the feeling , at the same time , that it \u2019 s very orchestrated , what \u2019 s happening : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle .\nThey move this piece and this piece , and then the picture is becoming more and more clear what \u2019 s going on .\nBut what are your experiences or your analysis of the situation ?\nBrian Gerrish : First of all , I \u2019 d agree with you that the Coronavirus \u201c pandemic \u201d , if we want to call it that in inverted commas , did catch everybody by surprise .\nI don \u2019 t think we saw that coming , and it happened very quickly .\nSo I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nBut I \u2019 ll come back to the fact that we started to see very , very serious things things happening in the UK .\nIf I just focus immediately on the Government \u2019 s use of applied behavioural psychology : back in 2010 and 2011 , we as the UK Column were warning that the Government had set up a team which was called the Behavioural Insights Team [ UK Column note : whose former homepage address \u2018 behaviouralinsights.co.uk \u2019 now redirects to the consciously globalist \u2018 bi.team \u2019 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were working directly alongside not only the political process , but the policy-forming process within the British Government .\nA critical document which we found in 2010 was called Mindspace ( you can find it very easily by searching online for it as a PDF document ) .\nIn that document , the Government admitted that it was using applied behavioural psychology to influence how it designed policy and how it implemented policy .\nAt one particular point in that document\u2014in fact , it \u2019 s at the bottom of page 66 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it can change the way people think and behave , and that people will not be aware that this has been done to them .\nBut it adds the caveat that if they do realise that their behaviour is changed , they will not know how it was changed .\nWe read this document and we were shocked , and we then started to research further .\nThat then led us to discover that , around that time and of course a little bit earlier , the British Government had been conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were bringing the political psychology teams together to produce joint plans with the French .\nThe key Frenchman who was present in the meetings was called Olivier Ouillier , and he was working directly at that time for Sarkozy \u2019 s private office .\nNow , all these meetings were essentially held in secret .\nWe were able to discover that they had taken place , but we were only able to discover that by carefully researching along specific routes which we understood were important .\nFor example , most of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were part of a charity , the Franco-British Council , which said it was simply set up in order to improve relationships between Britain and France .\nSo these meetings took place , and it was very clear that there was concerted effort to expand the use of these techniques : not only from Britain and France , but the implication at that time was that these techniques were going to be used across the wider power base of the European Union .\nAnd I \u2019 ll just say again that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time the Government would be able to use applied techniques where people would have their behaviour changed\u2014that means their thoughts changed !\n\u2014and they wouldn \u2019 t even be aware that it had occurred .\nBrian Gerrish : Well , if you want to execute power , then you \u2019 re going to try and use normal , democratic politics , or you \u2019 re going to try and use force , or you \u2019 re going to try and use other means .\nAnd so this comes to me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when I saw how cynical this was , how calculated it was , when I was using effectively my military background , I could see that this was the use of raw power .\nNow , if I jump forward into events around Covid : very early on in the Covid pandemic ( I \u2019 ve called it a \u201c pandemic \u201d ; of course , I don \u2019 t believe that that is what it is , but that \u2019 s how it was reported ) , it came to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SAGE , had actually had an internal meeting with elements of the Government \u2019 s Behavioural Insights Team .\nThe key gentleman concerned with this was a man called Dr David Halpern .\nThat meeting was not properly minuted in a proper official sense , but they did put out a briefing sheet from the meeting , and in that document , which I think was dated 22 March 2020 , it admitted that the SAGE team and the Government \u2019 s policy on Coronavirus was going to use applied psychology in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , in order to get the population to adhere more closely to the Government \u2019 s policy over the response to Coronavirus .\nWe have the document ; we can provide you with a copy of that document .\nReiner F\u00fcllmich : Yes , please , because we have the same thing .\nIt \u2019 s a leaked paper from the [ Federal ] Secretary of the Interior , and it is now referred to as the Panic Paper [ UK Column note : reported by us on 10 February , commencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I \u2019 ve heard about the paper in Germany .\nI haven \u2019 t seen it or been able to read it in English .\nI \u2019 m going to suggest to you that that German paper would have come out of the specific talks that I just referred to .\nWhen we started to see that the British Government was having these secretive meetings with French applied behavioural psychology experts , it was clear to us that this was going to be rolled out in other European countries .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that German document .\nNow , in the SAGE document , aside from saying that they were going to ramp up fear , there was something very interesting .\nIt said [ UK Column note : in paras .\n6\u20138 on p. 2 ] that inside [ local ] communities , community members were going to be used to effectively police each other .\nSo people were going to be used to put pressure on their neighbours , for example , to wear a mask ; to adhere to social distancing .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were talking about that they were going to use this covert applied psychology to pressurise citizens to act against one another .\nAnd , significantly , they also said that this had to be done with some care , because they believed that it was possible that this situation could get out of control .\nClearly , what they meant by that is that instead of having somebody saying to somebody else , \u201c You should wear a mask !\n\u201d , that requirement could be translated into violence .\nHaving told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific\u2014I now come back again to Bianca talking [ just before Brian Gerrish ] , because I could understand a little bit of what she was talking about : she talked about angst , she was talking about stress .\nNow , of course , the techniques that are being used on adults\u2014these psychological techniques to induce stress and fear\u2014are also being used on the children .\nI could only understand a tiny bit of what she was talking about , but I understood enough to grasp\u2014correct me if I \u2019 m wrong\u2014that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t know what the rules are from time to time .\nReiner F\u00fcllmich : Exactly , yes .\nEvery week , they changed the rules [ for schools ] , so that she had to sit at her desk over the weekend in order to figure out how to make these things work .\nBrian Gerrish : Right .\nAnd what that is , the uncertainty and the change in the rules : that is part of the psychological attack .\nBecause the uncertainty immediately is putting people in a position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we go back into the professional world of applied psychology , people who are in a distressed , confused state are very susceptible to further messages and instructions .\nIf there \u2019 s a fire in a building and people are starting to panic , the first person that starts to give clear commands to the people , those commands will be followed .\nAnd that is due to the psychological state .\nNow , I \u2019 m not professionally trained in psychology ; I do know a reasonable amount , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the investigations that I do .\nBut the other point that I want to bring into this is that many years ago , we started to get very interested in a charity called Common Purpose .\nCommon Purpose , as a charity , said it was there to create \u201c future leaders in society \u201d .\nIt effectively was like an octopus : it had tentacles , it got into the hospital system , it got into the police , it got into the military , it got into the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was essentially spreading a new philosophy in many areas .\nEverything I \u2019 m saying to you is fully documented .\nI have a website which is packed full of documents talking about what this organisation was doing .\nIt particularly went for children .\nIn the earliest days , it was going for children of the age of about 11 to 14 , but it also was interested in university students .\nAside from the fact that the people who went on [ its ] courses were selected , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their so-called training courses .\nWhen I was investigating this organisation , because I was extremely suspicious about what it was doing ( it was a very interesting claim to be \u201c choosing future leaders \u201d who were going to \u201c lead beyond authority \u201d ! )\n, [ I found that ] the training was clearly designed to produce people working in an organisation who were not working in the normal culture of the organisation .\nCommon Purpose had given them a new set of values .\nWhen I took some expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was the first time that I was told about the technique of neurolinguistic programming .\nNLP is actually a form of hypnosis .\nYou can look on the internet and you will find many consultancies providing training in NLP , and you will find many people providing training who say that it has a therapeutic [ value ] , that it can be used to care for people and help people .\nIn essence , this is true ; but what we were interested in is where we started to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo , [ we must ] bring these two together : \u2013 It is a fact that the British Government set up a specific applied psychology team .\n\u2013 It is a fact that that team was promoting ideas to make the population fearful around the pandemic .\nBut , on a much bigger scale , that team was using\u2014amongst other things\u2014NLP in order to influence virtually every document that the Government was producing .\nI don \u2019 t know whether any of your team have come across NLP before , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s an open secret ( you can go and research it , and many professional people teach it ) that essentially it \u2019 s a form of hypnosis .\nAnd this means that you can put across ideas and concepts to people which are not necessarily just going through their conscious mind .\nThis is fact ; this is not fiction .\nNow , when you start to see NLP being used for political objectives , of course , the wider public is very , very vulnerable , because unless you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NLP , you won \u2019 t even realise that it \u2019 s being used on you , and it can be used in a verbal sense but it can also be used in writing .\nSo , for example , you can have a document in front of you : you many notice a full stop at the end of a sentence ; that marker is in the wrong place , and you believe that somebody made a mistake when they were typing .\nBut this is not what NLP can do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you come to the full stop , your conscious mind makes one decision but your subconscious mind makes another one .\nAnd it is perfectly possible to be writing documents where it appears that one message is being put across but actually a completely different message is being put to the audience .\nIf I bring this into the realm of Coronavirus reaction , we are now seeing that every statement made by the Government , every piece of paper that comes out , is invariably very carefully crafted , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see that in much of this documentation , carefully-applied behavioural psychology is being used in the written word .\nTo back that up , to reinforce that : we also have a government document where they are specifically boasting of being able to use psychology in written documents .\nViviane Fischer : So you think that also the leaked documents that we see [ in Germany ] , like for instance this Panic Paper that was leaked by someone , or at least it was not officially put out\u2014I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess , also , because some people could see through the whole narrative then , after reading through the paper , but actually even the fact that it came out , and that some people read it or heard about it who were stuck in the fear narrative : maybe it even put them into more fear , just the way that it was designed .\nI mean , that you get an outcry , that a lot of people were upset that the Government would use this picture of your Grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child who infects her with Coronavirus ; but once this picture is kind of in the official realm , some people hear it and then have these fantasies in their head , and get even more afraid .\nBrian Gerrish : Well , that is absolutely correct .\nWe can see here in the UK that particularly the BBC has been using applied psychology in this way : heavily emotive , distressing photographs with very little factual reporting to support the image , the idea given in the photograph .\nThis is deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s now very easy to see that this is taking place .\nSo , [ with ] the background of everything that \u2019 s happened with the \u201c pandemic \u201d , we know that every speech that \u2019 s made , every document that goes out , is likely to contain a reinforcing psychological message .\nBut the other thing that I think that is important , from the UK at least ; if we go back to 2010 , when that Mindspace document was released , within a year we started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to prepare for a pandemic .\nSo , in 2016 [ N.B .\n: Brian said \u2018 2011 \u2019 by mistake , which was the year of the previous Pandemic Preparedness Paper ] , we had a thing called Exercise Cygnus , which was the UK influenza pandemic preparedness plan .\nThat was followed by other official documents talking about a possible future pandemic , and then in 2017 , there was a very significant document called Emergency Preparedness , Resilience and Response [ N.B .\n: Brian generalised the name as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] .\nWhat was , and what is , interesting in reading these documents is that some of them\u2014not all , but some of them\u2014qualify the document by saying , \u201c Well , we can \u2019 t predict that a pandemic will happen : we can look long-term over what \u2019 s happened in the world ; we can look back to 2018 and the flu pandemic and the damage ; but we can \u2019 t be certain of when there will be another future pandemic.\n\u201d But suddenly , in a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in the UK a flurry of papers\u2014and again , we can make these available to you\u2014where , suddenly , people are all talking about \u201c the coming pandemic \u201d .\nNow , these are UK political public documents .\nThey are not even on the level of the SPARS Pandemic-type documents , where these big exercises have been run in America and elsewhere , looking at the possibility of a pandemic coming .\nThis is a cluster of papers and supposed research in the UK which is quite extraordinary .\nIs it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have paper after paper warning that a pandemic is coming ?\nWhat I can see when I read these papers is very little fact but a lot of emotive language .\nAnd , of course , people who had a job in the public sector , in the lower government system , would have been very susceptible to reading this material and then thinking , \u201c My goodness , we need to make local preparations for this !\n\u201d So I look at these documents , and I \u2019 m pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seeding of ideas of a coming pandemic .\nOf course , those seeds were placed in people \u2019 s minds , and then the moment we started to get reports of a pandemic coming\u2014particularly , for us [ in Britain ] , from the BBC\u2014people would have started to become worried , or would have started to think about that material and would have started to react in a way that the Government would want .\nSo we \u2019 ve got the substantive evidence showing that the British Government will and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across , that substantive evidence saying that they \u2019 re going to go as far as making people fearful .\nAnd I \u2019 ll add that if you make people stressed and fearful , you \u2019 re also going to give them mental health problems , and we now live in a country where there \u2019 s a huge rise in depression and suicides , none of which is being talked about in the mainstream press , because the increase in those adverse mental health effects has been so huge since the lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an elephant in the room in the UK .\nWe have the evidence in documents of this type of calculated , destructive applied psychology ; but then you can also see , if you start talking to people in public services , to doctors and nurses in the National Health Service here and the hospital service , they are telling us that they \u2019 ve also witnessed the sudden flood of these papers , effectively preparing them for a pandemic that was coming .\nYet this was a pandemic that the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reiner F\u00fcllmich : Brian , at the beginning of today \u2019 s session , Dr Wolfgang Wodarg and I discussed the fact that a new narrative has been put out into the mainstream media , probably starting out in the United States with Fox News , and they have a host by the name of Tucker Carlson , who explained on one of his news shows that finally , there will be justice , because [ Anthony ] Fauci has been caught lying to the public about his involvement with the Wuhan virology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain-of-function experiments there , which was being financed behind the back of the American taxpayer , and against the will of the [ US ] Government , by US tax dollars .\nBut the real message wasn \u2019 t , \u201c We \u2019 re going to get Fauci.\n\u201d The real message was , \u201c Fauci didn \u2019 t tell us that there was a dangerous virus that escaped from the Wuhan lab !\n\u201d Now , in the meantime , we know that there was probably an accident at the Wuhan lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any real damage .\nHowever , those people who seem to have been preparing for this agenda to be rolled out ( as you just explained , and as others have explained to us before ) \u2014those people took this opportunity and used this as a springboard in order to start rolling out the \u201c pandemic \u201d , which is really a plandemic , and which is really only a PCR test pandemic .\nWould you agree with that , that in reality\u2014and this is really important\u2014we do not have a dangerous virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what John Ioannidis says , put the danger of this pandemic at about the level of a common flu : 0.14 or 0.15 % infection-fatality rate ; so would you agree that this is really not a pandemic but this is a co-ordinated effort ?\nAs you said when you first started talking to us , this is not madness , it is a calculated effort which uses lots of psychology , NLP , in order to keep people in fear , in order to make them do things that they otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I certainly do believe that .\nThere \u2019 s a number of points there in what you \u2019 ve just said to me .\nThe first important one is : all of the evidence that \u2019 s come in through the UK Column , and our analysis , has shown that even the Government \u2019 s own statistics have proven that what is happening is effectively a normal flu season .\nAnd although they tried extremely hard to manipulate and skew , bend the statistics , the Office for National Statistics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statistics that that centre pushed out to the public were actually correct , and showed that there was no pandemic .\nBut the Government \u2019 s interpretation of it was a blatant twisting of the facts and information .\nReiner F\u00fcllmich : The same thing happened here .\nBrian Gerrish : Yes , and I can reinforce that statement by saying to you that we now have a stream of people coming to us\u2014doctors and nurses\u2014saying that at the time when the British Government was claiming hospitals were full of Covid patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialist facilities that were created in hospitals never had a single patient going through them , never mind the big centre set up in London for thousands of patients that ended up , I think , with about 63 patients in a multi-thousand [ bed ] facility !\nIn hospitals , we have had hospital consultants [ senior treating physicians ] telling us that they were responsible for setting up specialist Covid wards , which they did , and when those wards were set up , they never had a single Covid patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening , the British Government sent elderly people , who clearly did have flu\u2014they were in the hospitals and they had flu , they were ill\u2014the Government sent those elderly people in their thousands back into the care and residential homes , where of course , in a closed environment , that infection spread .\nEven the wider press\u2014certainly the newspapers in the UK : the Daily Express , I think the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian\u2014all reported at one stage that the evidence was that tens of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , the experts that talk to us at the UK Column say the figure is not tens of thousands ; it \u2019 s hundreds of thousands .\nSo , we have the lie over whether it was a pandemic , and one of the tricks that the British Government and the BBC have used is that they talk about the statistics relating to Covid-19 in a cumulative sense .\nThey keep adding the figures together .\nBut , of course , flu is always logged as a seasonal occurrence .\nA flu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people die\u2014that \u2019 s always the case\u2014and then , as the weather gets better , flu disappears .\nAnd then , next winter , that is a new flu season , and the statistics start again .\nBut with Covid , the statistics have been added across the two seasons .\nNow , this is the use of psychology to manipulate people \u2019 s minds .\nIt \u2019 s absolutely blatant .\nYou mentioned Fauci .\nI believe that what you \u2019 re seeing at the moment is a smokescreen .\nYes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asked about what was happening in the Wuhan lab , and certainly we know that it has been standard procedure for many years that if a vaccine is to be created , the pharmaceutical companies will enhance a virus strain as part of their techniques for producing a new virus ; so we can imagine that in any laboratory , dangerous enhanced viruses might be created .\nSo we know that laboratories are doing what is essentially dangerous work on the enhancements of viruses , so it is of course possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timing of the suddenly turning of attention back to Fauci is very interesting , and I believe that this is being done because they know that the wider public is starting to ask the right questions about what has been done as a result of the Covid-19 vaccination policy .\nSo , to try to distract people away from asking the key questions about vaccination , they \u2019 re now coming back to Fauci .\nAnd the other man who has suddenly disappeared from the public arena is Bill Gates .\nNow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , there are a number of interesting questions , but the first problem he faced was that it became known that he had a friendship with Epstein .\nSo , all of a sudden , Mr Bill Gates has gone from being the squeaky clean , well-behaved entrepreneurial philanthropic businessman to being smeared with the fact that he had a very questionable friendship with [ Jeffrey ] Epstein .\nAnd Melinda Gates has now said that she warned her husband about that relationship many years ago .\nSo , suddenly , Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media .\nThat happened first , and now suddenly we \u2019 re getting attention focused back on Fauci .\nMy feeling is that the people who are responsible for this despicable plan have now started to think that the public is beginning to look in the right direction , and so they need something to distract them .\nAnd I think we \u2019 re going to see a ramping-up of accusations that it was the Chinese who produced a bioweapon , that Fauci was involved .\nThis is all emotive media stuff ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s been happening .\nThat \u2019 s my personal opinion ; I could be wrong .\nReiner F\u00fcllmich : Actually , I think we agree with that , and everyone who we \u2019 ve spoken to agrees with that .\nIt looks as though those who are responsible for this agenda are beginning to throw people under the bus , but\u2014obviously\u2014only for this very purpose : to distract the general public \u2019 s attention from what they \u2019 re doing .\nThey \u2019 re asking the right questions .\nSo , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they \u2019 re losing control , to a degree .\nThey \u2019 re not losing complete control , but they \u2019 re losing control .\nWhat do you think about this ?\nBrian Gerrish : I agree with that , and if we want to inject some good news into our discussion , the people we are up against , the people we are fighting , are inherent liars .\nThey tell lies ; they do not tell the truth .\nAnd the problem with that is that eventually , they become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this is a big part of what \u2019 s started to happen .\nI can give you another example , from within the UK , of where we see that there has suddenly been some emerging fear in the system .\nThe UK agency which is responsible for the safety and regulation of medication is called the MHRA , the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency .\nThat is the organisation which has been collecting data on vaccine adverse effects , and for you and anyone who \u2019 s ultimately watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that within the UK , there have been 859,481 adverse reactions \u2026 Reiner F\u00fcllmich : Did you say 850,000 ?\n!\nBrian Gerrish : 859,481 .\nAnd there have been 1,213 deaths .\nNow , those statistics are the UK Government \u2019 s own statistics ; they \u2019 ve not come from me , they \u2019 ve come from the UK Government , and they come from the MHRA Yellow Card system .\nThis is supposedly the safety system by which anybody who comes into contact with an adverse vaccine reaction\u2014whether it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a family member or friend , or indeed if you \u2019 re somebody in the medical profession\u2014you should log a Yellow Card vaccine adverse reaction message , and it is the MHRA that holds that database .\nNow , in the MHRA \u2019 s own documentation , they stated in 2018 that to their knowledge , for any medication , including vaccines , less than 10 % of the serious adverse reactions were ever recorded .\nLess than 10 % !\nAnd for more minor vaccine adverse reactions , they said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % and 4 % [ of the actual total ] .\nNow , if we consider that statement against [ the record of ] 859,000 adverse reactions and 1,213 deaths , we could be looking at 12,000 people who have died .\nWe as the UK Column have reported a great deal about this data , and on the ukcolumn.org website , my colleague , Mike Robinson , has provided a search engine so that you can search the MHRA \u2019 s own data .\nAnd this is very interesting , because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MHRA \u2019 s website ; it simply provides it as sheets of data .\nThis is very confusing and misleading for the public .\nBut the caveat that maybe only 10 % of serious effects got recorded is very significant .\nIn the last couple of weeks , the MHRA added a new paragraph in relation to that caveat about the low reporting of adverse effects .\nThey said , \u201c Of course , the figure of 10 % and 2\u20134 % does not apply to Yellow Card reports of Covid-19 vaccine adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Column started to draw the public \u2019 s attention to the fact that the MHRA already had 859,000 adverse effects recorded and 1,200 deaths , and that this might only be a very small proportion of the total number of adverse reactions , the MHRA attempted to deceive the public by posting a notice saying that this 10 % [ rule ] did not apply to adverse reactions as a result of Covid-19 vaccination .\nViviane Fischer : But did anyone buy this ?\nBrian Gerrish : Well , some people will inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public who read this information without having a fuller understanding are still in the psychological position that they believe what the Government tells them .\nAnd this is a very big mistake , of course .\nSo some people did believe them , but some didn \u2019 t .\nNow , we as a media organisation challenged that very strongly , and then something very interesting happened : the MHRA suddenly announced , in the last few days , that it was going to have a special initiative for patient information and safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents they produced , there \u2019 s words on the paper , but the documents do not actually say what they are going to do to improve patient safety .\nThe other part of the story in the UK is that the MHRA has overall responsibility for logging vaccine adverse effects , but what they are not doing is then investigating to produce the final conclusion on whether an effect was indeed created by a vaccine or not .\nViviane Fischer : The same here .\nBrian Gerrish : And if it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are starting to see that there \u2019 s a pattern emerging .\nThis can not be an accident ; this can not be a coincidence .\nViviane Fischer : And it \u2019 s amazing : we just discussed this earlier on in this session that they \u2019 re not doing autopsies .\nThey \u2019 re really refusing : it \u2019 s either coming from the state prosecutors or it \u2019 s somehow being hindered behind the scenes , political decisions , whatever .\nThey \u2019 re not doing any autopsies on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relatives that there might be a causality with regard to the vaccines .\nThey \u2019 re not looking at it , and if they do , they say , \u201c Oh , there \u2019 s no connection.\n\u201d Even after doing a minor , cursory inspection , they say , \u201c Oh , there \u2019 s no connection ; it can not be.\n\u201d Brian Gerrish : Well , that is also happening in the UK , that post mortems are not being conducted .\nWe \u2019 ve even seen\u2014this is factual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned\u2014 [ a case ] where a family \u2019 s father died of a heart attack very shortly after receiving a vaccination , and the hospital did not submit a Yellow Card report , and later , when the family had submitted that report , nothing happened .\nSix and a half weeks passed .\nThey then said to the MHRA , \u201c What are you doing to investigate the death ?\n\u201d And the first thing the MHRA asked them was , \u201c Was there a post mortem ?\n\u201d Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post mortem comes from the medical team , who should have taken a decision that it could be linked to the vaccine , [ and that ] therefore , there was a need for a post mortem .\nBut when it was too late , and the person had been buried , then the MHRA said , \u201c Well , there wasn \u2019 t a post mortem.\n\u201d And the other thing that happened in the UK , about two years ago , [ was a change : ] originally , death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors , and this , within the \u201c pandemic \u201d , was changed so that there only had to be one signature .\nConstantly , on the death certificates , \u201c Covid \u201d was recorded when family members said , \u201c But my father , my mother , my brother died of cancer !\n\u201d But because they had supposedly tested positive for Covid-19 , that was actually recorded as the cause of death .\nSo this is the official falsification of statistics , with a direct impact on the health of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is why I come back to the statement that it is not madness ; if you analyse very carefully the political decisions , the policies , the documents , what we are looking at is genocide .\nIt \u2019 s planned .\nIt \u2019 s premeditated .\nI \u2019 ve even had a senior member of the National Health Service\u2014who has spoken to us as a whistleblower\u2014use that very term .\nHer words were , \u201c What I have watched unfolding within the health service in the UK is genocide.\n\u201d Reiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical community ?\nBrian Gerrish : That was a board member of one of the NHS Boards .\nAnd we have nurses telling us this ; we have nurses using the term \u201c genocide \u201d .\nI have some doctors who are also using this term , but they \u2019 re not using it lightly , and they \u2019 re not using it because they \u2019 re aware that that other individual used it .\nIt comes out as a word when you interview them about their experiences and what they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the rush to vaccinate the children \u2026 The [ German ] Government has now said that from 7 June on , children are supposed to be vaccinated , and everything is supposed to be over and done before the next school year .\nSo this seems to be pretty outrageous ; obviously , a lot of people are very upset about this new thing .\nThey say it \u2019 s not going to be mandatory , but with peer pressure , and with them saying you can only access the schools again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with vaccination , of course , there \u2019 s pressure ; it \u2019 s basically mandatory , or it \u2019 s going to become mandatory .\nI wonder , do you think they are now rushing this through because they see that the side effects of the vaccinations are going to become more and more obvious ?\nMaybe if they introduced this later in the year , quite a few parents might shy away from the vaccinations , whereas now it \u2019 s still in-between , and maybe with the option of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe a good idea to lure people or nudge people into getting even their children vaccinated now ?\nWhat \u2019 s your take on that ?\nBrian Gerrish : I totally agree with your analysis there .\nIt is very clear that there is now a massive urgency to vaccinate children , and we can see that in open statements of politicians .\nOne politician , [ the former Health Secretary ] Jeremy Hunt , stood up in Westminster a couple of days ago and basically said that it was vital that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see open statements , but we can also see other documentation circulating where , again , there is this malicious use of psychology , because schoolteachers are being told that if they encounter parents who are reluctant to have their children vaccinated , those parents are effectively going to be listed as extremists .\nSo we can again see this psychological wedge coming in , to break people away from their children .\nOf course , if you get parents away from the children , then the Government can do what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I say this to you , I think it \u2019 s reasonable for me to say that many years ago , twenty years ago , I was reading a very informative political book called The European Union Collective : Enemy of its Member States [ by Christopher Story ] , and in that book there was a table which purported to be a table of the psychological attack on Western nations .\nIt involved a period of demoralisation ; it involved a period of destabilisation ; and the ultimate five years was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos and collapse .\nAnd as I read that table\u2014and I had not long been out of the military at that stage\u2014my mind said , \u201c Some of this is happening around us .\nI can think of examples !\n\u201d And I have given public talks on part of this idea\u2014I will call it an \u201c idea \u201d \u2014that a psychological attack , a demoralising attack , is being unleashed on our respective nations .\nI believe that that is the case .\nAnd I believe that when you see how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie , is being mirrored in the UK , in France , in Germany , and across all the other countries , then we can see that clearly , the power base that \u2019 s injecting this is not democratic in any form .\nIt \u2019 s hostile to us .\nI \u2019 ll just add , because it \u2019 s a little thing that I didn \u2019 t want to forget , that Bill Gates has supported an organisation called CEPI : the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations .\nThe Bill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred million dollars to that organisation .\nWell , by a \u201c miracle \u201d , CEPI ended up funding the very biological testing laboratory that the MHRA in the UK was going to use , and is using , to tell us whether the vaccines are safe !\nSo Bill Gates \u2019 money goes into CEPI ; and from CEPI , it goes to support the very laboratory that is being used to tell us that vaccines are safe\u2014on the basis that they \u2019 ve recorded 860,000 side effects , officially !\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to whether there \u2019 s causation there with the vaccines themselves .\nThat research has not been done .\nSo it \u2019 s obvious that what you have is a system that has been set up in order to deceive the public about what is truly happening with these vaccines .\nAnd I think they want the children because they are now quite scared to see the right questions being asked , and they know that if they want to get the children vaccinated , they \u2019 ve got to hurry .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ question .\nWe \u2019 re looking at all the measures : the masks , this bizarre testing , now the vaccination , and the social distancing .\nDo you think these have foremost a psychological aspect , of being that you \u2019 re power-struck or that you have to show obedience ?\nAnd also , I was wondering : do you think it \u2019 s maybe also , in addition , that they \u2019 re all technologically , pharmacologically , all elements of the same goal : to get you sick ?\nBecause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the swabs , we know , that is not good , and the masks are making people get infected more easily with a virus or the flu or whatever .\nSo could it be that it \u2019 s also really elegantly orchestrated on a medical basis ?\nBrian Gerrish : Yes .\nI think what you are saying is correct .\nIt \u2019 s difficult for people [ to imagine ] .\nIf we say that we are reasonable people\u2014we , the assembled people here today , are not perfect , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re concerned about our fellow man and woman ; that \u2019 s what \u2019 s in our heads\u2014when you have that in your head , it \u2019 s very difficult for you then to look at somebody who is unleashing an utterly brutal plan on people .\nIf even [ just ] tens of thousands of elderly people were deliberately killed in the UK ( and I believe the evidence for that is overwhelming ) , then the people who took the decision to kill the elderly people are also capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of society that they don \u2019 t believe are worth anything .\nJust to come back to psychology and documents : I have a National Health Service document which is talking about patient safety , and it says \u201c If we did this or that , we could perhaps save the lives of 160 people a year .\nThat would be worth \u00a323 million.\n\u201d Every time the NHS document is talking about protecting human beings , it puts a financial value on that .\nAnd when I see those sentences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written that document does not think in the way that I suspect you and we all think .\nSo , what they \u2019 re doing to the children with the masks and the social distancing\u2014and giving them lessons in \u201c how dangerous the virus is \u201d \u2014that is frightening the children .\nThis is all a psychological attack on their minds , and the people are doing it know full well that this is going to result in all sorts of mental health problems in the children .\nThere \u2019 s a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Chart of Coercion .\nIt \u2019 s a World Health Organisation-recognised paper about non-physical techniques of torture .\nVirtually every Covid pandemic measure can be ticked off against one of the entries in Biderman \u2019 s chart .\nAnd as I was waiting to come live with you , a very well-informed lady has sent me a document where in the UK , they \u2019 re now saying that if a baby is born and there is any suspicion that that child may test positive for Covid , there should be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s really getting out of hand .\nDo you think that the spin for this whole thing is written in England ?\nDo you think that [ the UK ] is really the spider in the web ?\nWould you discover [ that ] , together with the French people ?\nIs it an American script ?\nIt must be centrally organised somehow .\nBrian Gerrish : Well , this of course is a very interesting question , because when I talked about the destabilisation chart [ in Christopher Story \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Communist plan to destabilise the West .\nBut I think that if we take a more mature view of it at the moment , if we look at the power base ( and at the moment , we \u2019 re focused on the power base of the pharmaceutical companies ) , the power base is within the networks of those companies .\nAnd , of course , those companies can only function with the people who control their billions of dollars of working capital and profits .\nSo , for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that if you want to start working out who is doing this , then you have to look at who is actually controlling the sums of money .\nAnd this can be quite emotive , depending on how you put this argument across , but in the UK , the Government\u2014which has not been able to build hospitals , which can \u2019 t fill in holes in the road , which can \u2019 t run the schools\u2014suddenly announces that we have got \u00a3800 billion which has appeared out of thin air in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tells us something very important .\nThe other thing which I think is significant at the moment is : you might have thought a few years ago that if such a pandemic happened , then at this stage , when the economy is so badly hit , we would be hearing the banks complain ; we would be hearing the banks saying that \u201c This is disastrous , because the British economy has shrunk by 30 % to 40 % .\nThe banks can \u2019 t function.\n\u201d But actually , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that the banks are happy .\nThey must be happy , because they \u2019 re silent .\nReiner F\u00fcllmich : It is , according to what we have learnt by now , the banks .\nIt \u2019 s high finance which is profiting from all this , through their investments in the pharmaceutical and the tech industry .\nBut the bottom line of all this , if this is an agenda ( and I have no doubt that it is an agenda ; it \u2019 s a calculated effort ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , of the small and medium-sized businesses , driving them into bankruptcy , and the actual killing of people , is not collateral damage ; it \u2019 s the intended damage , right ?\nBrian Gerrish : It \u2019 s intended , and about nine months ago ( I can \u2019 t substantiate it further , because it \u2019 s a whistleblower ) , a whistleblower who had clearly been within some reasonably high-level meetings within the British Government told us he was shocked that at one stage , they \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium-sized businesses .\nHe said it was discussed in a way that was so cold that it really disturbed him .\nWhen he came out of the meeting , he could not believe what he had just heard .\nThe previous Governor of the Bank of England , Mark Carney , announced publicly several times that companies that did not adhere to the new \u201c climate change \u201d greening agenda would be punished .\nThey would be put out of business .\nHe said that publicly , and anybody operating a small business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man was talking about .\nAnd , of course , if you stop small businesses from working , you are stopping people from earning a living ; and when they can \u2019 t pay to live , when they can \u2019 t pay to eat , that also increases mental health problems .\nThe word in English for this is \u201c malevolent \u201d : it \u2019 s a poisonous agenda .\nBut it \u2019 s deliberate , because it \u2019 s being spoken in Parliament and it \u2019 s appearing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viviane Fischer : What was the pseudo-argument that people from the Government used when they talked about the small and medium-sized businesses needing to be taken out ?\nClimate change ?\nBrian Gerrish : Well , of course , they \u2019 re selling to the wider public that there is a climate change problem , and it \u2019 s desperate [ ly important ] that we take any and every measure to deal with the climate issue ; and if that means that a few hundred thousand small businesses are going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what \u2019 s got to happen .\nSo the fear factor is the constant thing : the psychology is based on fear and control .\nWe \u2019 ve got to be fearful , because the world \u2019 s going to end because of climate change .\nWe \u2019 ve got to be fearful of a pandemic .\nWe \u2019 ve got to be fearful of a war with China and Russia .\nThis is deliberate , calculated psychology .\nAnd , to my mind , this is why , if we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vaccination , then we have to address this issue as well .\nWhen we can prove that our governments are lying and using propaganda , that has to be hit as hard as saying to the public , \u201c We can show you that the vaccines are dangerous , because of these statistics around adverse reactions.\n\u201d We have to do the two things simultaneously .\nOne of the ironies is that lockdown has been very good for the UK Column , because many , many more people are coming to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably get six , seven , eight e-mails where people say , \u201c We would like to thank you for keeping us sane .\nYour news , your information , your facts , your analysis has helped keep us sane , because we were getting distressed ; we were getting anxious.\n\u201d And that is a huge compliment to us .\nThat is something very special that those people are telling us .\nBut , of course , what it also told us was how powerful this effect was on the minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one last question .\nWe have the impression\u2014and it \u2019 s maybe connected to what you said about neurolinguistic programming\u2014that people are under some sort of spell .\nWe \u2019 ve discussed this with a lot of psychologists .\nBrian Gerrish : Well , we also believe this .\nThis is [ the conclusion ] we \u2019 ve come to .\nWe can say that people are under a spell , and the best description , we believe , is that they \u2019 ve been mesmerised .\nViviane Fischer : Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can break through this spell ?\nIs there a way ?\nReiner F\u00fcllmich : Information .\nWe have to get the information out , because knowledge is what kills the illusion .\nReal knowledge kills the illusion that they \u2019 ve created .\nBrian Gerrish : This is true , but we also have to be realistic : if you look at what happens when you attempt to hypnotise a group of people , then you get a bell curve distribution .\nSome people are very susceptible to it and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly affected ; and some people it \u2019 s very difficult to hypnotise .\nSo , across the population , I believe you need to think about it in a bit more of a measured way : you \u2019 re going to have some people that I think , probably , we \u2019 re not going to get to .\nThey \u2019 re gone .\nThey can \u2019 t think for themselves .\nAnd you \u2019 ll have other people\u2014you are clearly some ; I hope I am one\u2014who see through what \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what they say or \u201c show \u201d us ; we can see what the truth is .\nSo , by exposing it and putting out the correct information ourselves , we are getting through that hypnosis .\nAnd , to be positive , I think that is accelerating .\nThe British Government has just announced that it \u2019 s spending \u00a31.6 billion to interface with media companies !\n\u00a31.6 billion .\nThe BBC \u2019 s budget is \u00a35 billion on its own .\nSo a \u00a35 billion BBC [ evidently isn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest propaganda machine the world has ever seen .\nIt is the most dangerous organisation .\nYou should not believe anything the BBC says without checking it with another source .\nI could talk to you for an hour about what the BBC really is .\nReiner F\u00fcllmich : Yes , well , we have the very same problem with our national public radio and television stations , I believe .\nIt may be worse in Great Britain , however , because I think your history is a lot longer with that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 m sorry , I didn \u2019 t answer Viviane \u2019 s question fully on whether I thought the seat for this was in the UK .\nI am very embarrassed to say that I do believe it is in the UK .\nWe are looking at a power base which is a mixture of the monetary power of the City of London , and what is very clear from the documentation is that that monetary power base is now fully working with the wider security services .\nThis is part of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fusion Doctrine .\nThat \u2019 s another discussion , but essentially , we can see that the monetary power base is now controlling both the intelligence networks , like GCHQ [ equivalent of Germany \u2019 s BND ] , but also the secret services .\nThey are acting together .\nIt is fact , I assure you , because it was announced publicly ( but very quietly ! )\nthat we now have both Google and GCHQ , the British signals intelligence organisation , working inside the National Health Service .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture emerges , it is becoming ever clearer for more and people to understand : to first see and then ask questions and understand .\nThat \u2019 s why they \u2019 re pushing so hard , because they understand that something is going off the rails right now .\nBrian Gerrish : Yes , they \u2019 re understanding that people are waking up , and we are seeing this .\nI think that there has been a great \u2026 Social media has stabilised .\nI think , in many places on social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge improvement in the quality and the accuracy of information coming out , and I don \u2019 t think they ever realised that people would use social media for professional analysis and reporting , as you \u2019 re doing today .\nThis frightens them a lot .\nBrian Gerrish : So I think we \u2019 ve got to expose what \u2019 s going on .\nThe other thing that we have learnt over ten years is that it \u2019 s always better to slightly understate what you \u2019 re talking about .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can always come back and have another go ; but if you \u2019 re too aggressive , if you \u2019 re too forceful , if you scare people , then you lose them .\nSo we \u2019 ve tried to always be talking about what \u2019 s happening very quietly , in a measured way , and also we don \u2019 t cover all of the things that we \u2019 re watching .\nTo take an example , people are talking about magnets sticking to you after an injection .\nNow , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s true or not ; I \u2019 m interested to follow it , to see ; [ but ] I \u2019 m not going to report on it , because until I can prove it , I don \u2019 t want to say anything that could undermine what else we \u2019 ve talked about .\nSo I think the [ approach ] of not being caught up in being too outspoken and aggressive helps people to come to us , to absorb the information .\nIf you want to end on a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put some greenery behind me today , because I thought a little bit of sunshine and some greenness might lift our spirits a bit .\nI believe that something very interesting has happened in the last four or five months : professional people are beginning to ask the right questions .\nI think that the speed at which this is happening is now causing all of these strange decisions you \u2019 re seeing by the establishment : [ the sacrificing of ] Fauci , the rush to get the children vaccinated even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the policy through\u2014this , to me , is a sign that they are very frightened people .\nThe last thing I \u2019 d like to say\u2014and I have to smile when I say it\u2014is that there was an activist in Chicago called Saul Alinsky , who wrote an extremely good book which is called Rules for Radicals , and in the book he \u2019 s talking essentially about techniques to overthrow government , but one of the things he says is \u201c Always make the argument personal.\n\u201d Reiner F\u00fcllmich : That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes .\nBrian Gerrish : And so it \u2019 s not enough to talk about \u201c the BBC \u201d ; we \u2019 ve got to talk about Tim Davie , the Director-General of the BBC .\nIt \u2019 s not enough for me to talk about \u201c the MHRA \u201d ; I \u2019 ve got to talk about Dr June Raine , the Chief Executive of the MHRA .\nThe other little thing , which you can accept or laugh at\u2014I \u2019 m very happy either way\u2014is that even in writing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s very powerful if you put their picture on the letter or the e-mail that you send to them , because what that does is it takes it from a dry communication to actually putting straight into their minds that you are looking at them as an individual .\nAnd , of course , what am I doing here ?\nI \u2019 m using applied psychology , but if the bad people use it on us , I think we can use a little bit of it back on them .\nReiner F\u00fcllmich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 re doing , actually .\nWe \u2019 re making it personal .\nWe \u2019 re going after these people personally , not after the institutions .\nBrian , thank you very , very much .\nThis was extremely interesting and very important , and I think we \u2019 re going to be able to hear more of each other , because we have to stay in touch now that we realise\u2014I mean , we \u2019 ve had this suspicion all along , but now we realise that this is an internationally-concerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people .\nBrian Gerrish : Yes , and what a wonderful opportunity that is , because whatever else these people do , they are constantly pitting nations against nations .\nIf we get a little bit broader and we look back at the wars and the trouble , it was this type of people that caused it , and I think we \u2019 ve got a wonderful opportunity now .\nThe \u201c pandemic \u201d that \u2019 s been thrown at us to make us fearful could actually be the very thing to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what their nationality or religion or colour is .\nI think we \u2019 ve got a very exciting opportunity here .\nReiner F\u00fcllmich : We agree .\nIt \u2019 s

the most courageous well-credentialed academic physicians out there and I hope to interview him soon .\nHe is vice chief of internal medicine at Baylor University Medical Center and despite his impeccable credentials , he has been vilified for stating during the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic , that it was all about the vaccine and getting a global mass vaccination campaign underway .\n\u201c All roads lead to the vaccine , \u201d McCullough said in a recent interview ( video above1,2 ) , with stakeholders banking on countries mandating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above is a 16-minute outtake from a much longer interview , which is the second video.3 McCullough points out that a number of countries are already talking about making the as-yet unlicensed COVID-19 vaccine compulsory , meaning anyone and everyone can be forced to take it against their will .\n\u201c That \u2019 s how bad stakeholders want vaccination , \u201d McCullough says .\n\u201c They do want a needle in every arm .\nBut why ?\n\u201d That \u2019 s the million-dollar question right there .\nRecent weeks have seen a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. , from free doughnuts , cake,4 french fries , hot dogs and pizza,5 to arcade tokens,6 10-cent beer,7 free state park season passes,8 free Uber and Lyft rides,9 free marijuana10 and Cincinnati Reds baseball tickets,11 a chance to win a full scholarship12 and even $ 1 million13 and $ 5 million14 giveaways .\nBelow is a more complete list of incentives , posted on vaccines.gov.15 To say the vaccine push has an air of desperation about it would be a profoundly serious understatement .\nConsidering the U.S .\nVaccine Adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logged more deaths following COVID-19 vaccination than all available vaccines combined from mid-1997 until the end of 201316 \u2014 a period of 15 1/2 years \u2014 one has to wonder why our leaders are so insistent on everyone getting these experimental gene therapies .\nThey \u2019 re even pushing for former COVID-19 patients to get the jab , even though they already have superior permanent immunity17 and studies show they have a far higher risk of severe side effects from the COVID jab.18 If it \u2019 s really about protecting the public against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID patients \u2014 whose protection is far superior to vaccine-induced immunity \u2014 offered some sort of immunity passport or granted access to sporting events or education that is now only granted to those with vaccine certificates ?\nWhat \u2019 s more , North Carolina has now passed legislation that allows children as young as 12 to get the COVID vaccine without parental consent.19 Think about that .\nAs of May 21 , 2021 , 4,406 Americans had died after the COVID vaccine,20 including three teenagers,21,22,23,24 and 12-year-olds are now being encouraged to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ?\nAs noted by McCullough , historically , the threshold at which an experimental vaccine program is shut down is 25 to 50 deaths , yet here we are , with over 4,000 deaths being reported in the U.S. and many thousands more in Europe.25,26 In a recent report , the Israeli People Committee , a civilian body of health experts , similarly concluded that \u201c there has never been a vaccine that has harmed as many people.\n\u201d 27 After vaccinating 45 million with the pandemic swine flu vaccine in 1976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 25 deaths.28 ( The number of deaths reported after the 1976 inoculation program varies from three to 53 , depending on the source.29,30,31,32 ) And let \u2019 s remember this too : If something goes wrong , the vaccine manufacturers are completely indemnified against lawsuits .\nYou \u2019 re on your own .\nAs a physician , McCullough is no longer recommending this vaccine , and other prominent virologists and physicians are calling for a stop to the program .\nSadly , many are complying simply because they \u2019 re desperate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew before , of sending their children to school , keeping their job and leading the life they had before the pandemic .\nDon \u2019 t do it , McCullough says \u2014 don \u2019 t fall for this trap because it \u2019 s only going to make things worse .\nBy vaccinating everyone against a very narrow spectrum of immunity \u2014 the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein , which has since mutated in any number of ways and no longer exists \u2014 \u201c we are setting ourselves up for a superbug that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d he says .\nAs such , the COVID-19 vaccine is a bioweapon , McCullough warns , and the side effect concerns are \u201c far beyond anything we have ever seen \u2026 Americans should be extraordinarily alarmed.\n\u201d What \u2019 s This Vaccine Program Really About ?\nWhy is the vaccine pushed in this way ?\nMcCollough believes it \u2019 s a global goal to \u201c mark \u201d people , to get you into their vaccine database , which will eventually be turned into a tool for population control , courtesy of vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about population control , there are two distinct forms , and both may apply in this case .\nOne form of population control is about controlling people through the ideology of utilitarianism , vaccine passports and a social credit system , all of which are tied together .\nAnother form is actual depopulation .\nUtilitarianism is based on a mathematical equation that some individuals can be sacrificed for the greater good of the majority .\nIn other words , if some people are harmed by vaccines , it \u2019 s an acceptable loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reap gains .\nThis discredited pseudo-ethic has repeatedly been used to justify horrific human rights abuses .\nThe Third Reich , for example , employed the utilitarian rationale as an excuse to demonize and eliminate minorities judged to be a threat to the health , security and well-being of the State.33 Now , utilitarianism is being called upon yet again , under the false narrative that mankind as a whole is in peril unless everyone rolls the dice and gets vaccinated .\nIn the end , the idea is that vaccine refusers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in society any longer .\nThis is the disincentive or negative incentive , which is added on top of the positive incentives previously mentioned .\nWhile U.S. government officials realize they can not mandate vaccination on a national level , as it would be a direct violation of the U.S. Constitution , they are pushing for it nonetheless by encouraging private companies to mandate vaccination as a condition of employment or access to services .\nThey \u2019 re also spending billions of dollars on advertising in conventional media , paid for by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passports are a way to force compliance .\nBut the vaccine database can also form the foundation for a much larger control structure , a social credit system , where you lose points any time you behave in a way that is deemed undesirable .\nThis quite literally could be anything , judging by the Chinese social credit system .\nPeople with low social credit scores can \u2019 t travel on certain kinds of public transportation , can \u2019 t travel overseas , hold certain jobs , go to school or even get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once you \u2019 re in this system , you \u2019 re under someone else \u2019 s control .\nIf they say you have to get a booster shot , you have to comply \u2014 again and again \u2014 or risk losing basic human rights , such as the ability to buy and sell , travel or get an education\u2026 Continue this report with references at Mercola.com In my view , there are still so many potential avenues of harm and so many uncertainties , I would encourage everyone to do your homework , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential pros and cons , ignore all pressure tactics and take your time when deciding whether to get any of these COVID-19 gene therapies .\nAnd , if you or someone you love has already received a COVID-19 vaccine and are experiencing side effects , be sure to report it , preferably to all three of these locations.43 While adverse effects and deaths have thus far been ignored , we need as much data as possible if we \u2019 re to have any chance of stopping

Duress: Are Coerced COVID-19 Vaccinations Proportionate?", "content": "To begin this article , in order to lay to rest the inevitable criticism that I am \u201c telling people not to get vaccinated \u201d , I want to state unequivocally my view that any person who wishes to take any vaccine should do so .\nIdeally , such a decision would be on the basis of fully informed consent and should never happen as a result of any form of coercion .\nWhy do I mention coercion ?\nIf you have never looked into the details of the Nuremberg code , now would be a good time .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dangerous medical experiments carried out on an unsuspecting public during the second world war , states very clearly that voluntary informed consent is required for any person taking part in a medical experiment .\nThe principle of voluntary informed consent protects the right of the individual to control his or her own body .\nMoreover , any person deciding to take part in a medical experiment should have the legal capacity to give consent , and there should be no element of fraud , force , deceit , coercion or duress .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found here : https : //media.tghn.org/medialibrary/2011/04/BMJ_No_7070_Volume_313_The_Nuremberg_Code.pdf So , a FUNDAMENTAL principle in the Nuremberg Code is that , whether or not a person takes any medication , vaccines included , should be a matter of individual informed choice .\nNowhere should coercion be part of the process .\nYet everywhere we look today we see coercion , force , propaganda , bribery and very slick and well-funded \u201c persuasion \u201d intended to get people jabbed with a COVID-19 \u201c vaccine \u201d .\nEarly May 2021 , the state of Ohio started running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million prizes to each of 5 lucky vaccinated people .\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio recently did a news conference promoting new fast food vouchers for a Shake Shack burgers and fries for residents who get their COVID-19 shots .\nIn Hong Kong we now have lotteries for property in order to \u201c encourage \u201d people to get the jab !\nIn the UK , a contract worth GBP320 million was awarded to the OMD GROUP LIMITED for \u201c media buying service \u201d \u2013 to do advertising around COVID19 , and presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID vaccinations .\nGo to https : //www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/search/ and search for \u201c COVID 19 media buying.\n\u201d The information barrage is clearly having an effect .\nHowever , according to authorities around the world , the massively funded PR ( read propaganda ) campaigns seem not to be doing the job that is required .\nSo , we \u2019 re seeing more and more examples of outright coercion , intended to force people to get injected with the COVID-19 \u201c vaccines \u201d .\nI have been observing various people from both Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not they should proceed to get the COVID-19 jab .\nThey are struggling because they believe that if they don \u2019 t get the jab , their freedom of movement or even their ability to hold down a job , will be significantly impaired .\nOne neighbour informed me that he realises the COVID-19 vaccines have only been approved for emergency use and have not been fully tested for safety .\nHowever , he wants to travel to another country in Asia to see his wife but can \u2019 t do so unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under duress , he has taken the jab even though he feels there are significant risks .\nI saw him today .\nHe looks ten years older , his face grey and drawn .\nHe \u2019 s angry , and clearly feels violated .\nOthers ( including in Hong Kong ) have told me that they are under pressure from their employers to get the jab and are in fear of losing their job if they fail to do so .\nWhile these personal observations may be anecdotal , they do illustrate an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duress are very real , and perhaps more significant than mainstream media coverage is indicating .\nIn New Zealand at the end of April 2021 , the government announced that in order to work , people dealing with incoming flights to the country had to have the jab .\nAnd , if they came to work without the jab they would then be liable to a $ 4000 fine and/or jail time .\nNote the following legislative text : https : //www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2021/0094/latest/LMS487911.html In Canada , regulations are being passed allowing children to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent , even though young people are at near ZERO risk of ever getting ill from , let alone dying of COVID-19 .\nOther government bodies are moving forward with mandatory vaccinations .\nAuthorities in Buri Ram Province in Thailand recently issued an order requiring everyone to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or risk being jailed for up to two years or fined .\nPeople who refuse to be vaccinated may be liable to a maximum two years in prison and/or a fine up to 40,000 baht for breaching Thailand \u2019 s emergency decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official line that a Covid vaccination is not mandatory , but they are obviously working with industry groups to facilitate certain companies and organisations to compel vaccination using threats of withdrawal of services as a lever .\nFor example , in the US , Anthony Fauci , the chief medical advisor to President Joe Biden , said he expects businesses like airlines and cruise ships to require customers to show proof of getting a COVID-19 vaccine before coming on-board .\nVis-\u00e0-vis universities he stated : \u201c [ i ] f you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning , you \u2019 re going to have to show proof of vaccination.\n\u201d Ergo , if you \u2019 re not vaccinated for COVID-19 you basically can \u2019 t travel or go to school .\nIn the UK , on May 19 Sean O \u2019 Grady wrote in The Independent that people who have not had the COVID-19 injection should be punished .\nAs he said : \u201c No jab , no job ; no jab , no access to NHS healthcare ; no jab , no state education for your kids .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restaurants , theatres , cinemas , stadiums .\nNo jab , no entry to the UK , and much else.\n\u201d In Hong Kong the government \u201c has offered the incentive of further relaxing social-distancing rules if staff and customers of restaurants and other venues are vaccinated , \u201d as reported recently .\nTo be clear , every single one of the above examples violates the Nuremberg principles , wherein there should be no element of fraud , force , deceit , coercion or duress .\nA question that we should ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product that is supposed to have so much benefit and ( we are told ) so little downside , why would cash lotteries , free hamburgers , incentives of varying kinds , massive ad campaigns , and non-stop cajoling be required ?\nWhy are threats to limit freedom of movement , use of services , and even the opportunity to make a living , being made in order to ( literally ) force people to get the COVID-19 injection ?\nWouldn \u2019 t people just go and get jabbed because they know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Peter McCollough recently said , \u201c why ( do stakeholders ) want a needle in every arm ?\nWhy \u201d ?\nDr. McCollugh is a Texas based doctor who successfully treated COVID-19 patients and was the lead author in a study published in the American Journal of Medicine that summarized existing drugs already approved and in the market that had success in treating COVID-19 patients .\nHis paper is published here : https : //www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343 ( 20 ) 30673-2/fulltext Under normal circumstances many would agree that actions to coerce a medical intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 onto an entire population , are nothing short of blackmail .\nAnd , as we know , people really don \u2019 t like to be blackmailed .\nPerhaps this explains the fact that , despite all the pressure , only 10 per cent of Hong Kong \u2019 s population have volunteered to receive the first jab .\nIt may also explain the fact that around 40 % -50 % of employees at the US NIH ( National Institute of Health \u2013 Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2019 s organization ) have also not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were given priority .\nOf course , all these people exercising their right NOT to be vaccinated is pejoratively labelled by many in the media as \u201c vaccine hesitancy \u201d .\nWe are told that such hesitancy is childish and does not reflect the supposed reality that vaccines are \u201c safe and effective \u201d .\nIn a recent SCMP editorial , the mantra that \u201c vaccines are safe and effective \u201d is repeated , and we are told that \u201c inoculations bring about immunity without causing illness , prevent the spread of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the makers of the various COVID-19 vaccines have stated on the record that these vaccines are not guaranteed to prevent you getting a COVID-19 infection ( i.e .\nthey do NOT necessarily inoculate you ) .\nAs the Pfizer COVID-19 FACT SHEET FOR RECIPIENTS AND CAREGIVERS states , \u201c the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is a vaccine ( sic ) and may prevent you from getting COVID-19 .\nThere is no U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved vaccine to prevent COVID-19 \u201d and \u201c The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text here : http : //labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx ?\nid=14472 Of importance is the fact that we already see many reports of people diagnosed with COVID-19 after receiving these very same vaccinations !\nWhether or not these injections prevent you infecting others is also a very open question , especially if the criterion for \u201c infection \u201d is a positive PCR Test .\nSee my recent article in China Daily that goes into this problem in detail : https : //www.chinadailyhk.com/article/168617 # The-COVID-19-gaslighting-express As to the belief that the current crop of vaccines is safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts .\nFirstly reports of injury submitted to VAERS ( Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ) in the US following COVID-19 vaccines over only 4 months , are higher than all reported vaccine injuries from all vaccines over the past 15 years .\nAs of May 26 , 2021 , based on a single search I personally made in the VAERS database , deaths recorded in that system following COVID-19 jabs stood at 3,528 , with many tens of thousands of reported injuries .\nYou can check this data for yourself online by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Eudravigilance website that was launched by the European Medicines Agency in 2012 provides public access to reports of suspected side effects ( also known as suspected adverse drug reactions ) .\nTheir report through May 8 , 2021 lists 10,570 deaths and 405,259 injuries following injections of four experimental COVID-19 shots .\nAccording to The Standard , in a recent report Hong Kong already appears to have had 12 deaths occurring post-vaccination for COVID-19 .\nGiven the presence of all this information ANY blanket statement about vaccine safety needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-world data related to the actual impacts of COVID-19 injections .\nAnd , importantly , as a person makes a decision about whether or not to get jabbed that person needs to estimate relative risk from COVID-19 vs the risks associated with getting the injections .\nSecondly , most people are probably unaware that the COVID-19 injections are currently only in the middle of Phase III trials , which are scheduled to end in 2023 .\nAND , the injections now available have only been given provisional approval .\nIn the US , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use Authorization ) only .\nIn the UK , COVID-19 these injections have only been given conditional approval .\nThis is indicated on official documents from the vaccine manufacturers .\nFor instance , Pfizer \u2019 s own documentation states : \u201c This EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine will end when the Secretary of HHS determines that the circumstances justifying the EUA no longer exist or when there is a change in the approval status of the product such that an EUA is no longer needed.\n\u201d ( i.e .\nwhen the FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective ) .\nOf interest is the fact that the vaccines being produced by Johnson & Johnson in the US are coming out with no information on the vaccine inserts i.e .\nthe consumer information normally found inside the vaccine packaging communicating about dosages , side effects , etc .\nThe vaccine inserts are physically in the box , but they are blank .\nSo , any persons injecting themselves with the current crop of emergency use vaccines are in fact volunteering to participate as a subject in a medical trial .\nNature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK roll-out in December 2020 , admitting that , \u201c The vaccine has completed only a few months of the two-year clinical-trial period that it will need to complete before it is approved to be sold freely on the market .\nAs a result , health officials , clinicians and people receiving the vaccine will be watching closely for as-yet unobserved signs of danger.\n\u201d Also of importance is the fact , probably unknown to most people , that the vaccine companies have been granted immunity from all legal challenges due to injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would that be ?\nMakes one wonder , does it not ?\nPerhaps the question we should be asking is cui bono ?\n\u2013 Latin for \u201c who benefits \u201d ?\nGiven the above information , the only basis upon which an intelligent and informed person would accept being injected with any new and not fully tested medical intervention would be if there was a deadly disease sweeping the world for which there is no cure and to which everybody is vulnerable .\nBased on the massive amounts of epidemiological evidence gathered over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is definitely not the case .\nAs early as mid-2020 the CDC indicated that COVID-19 has a survival rate of somewhere between 99.6 % and 99.8 % .\nAlso , the average age of death due to COVID-19 ( based on UK data ) is roughly 82 years old , which just happens to be one year longer than the common lifespan age of about 81 .\nHence , based on the official figures , COVID-19 will not affect most people , so one can not claim that the entire population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults statistically have zero risk , and even older people who have met with other corona viruses will in most cases have cross-immunity which protects them from COVID-19 .\nThe belief that COVID-19 will \u201c get us all \u201d is not supported by the science or the data .\nSee my China Daily article : https : //www.chinadailyhk.com/article/168617 # The-COVID-19-gaslighting-express It is notable that as of 19 March 2020 , COVID-19 was no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease ( HCID ) in the UK , based partly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall .\nSee government guidance here : https : //www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-hcid Thirdly , the belief that there is \u2018 no cure for COVID \u2019 is also wildly out of place .\nThere are a number of well known medications which have demonstrated successful results in treating those with this severe respiratory illness .\nFor instance , Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) with Zinc , used early in a COVID-19 infection , has been very successful in significantly reducing hospitalization and death .\nSo has Ivermectin .\n\u201c Fact checkers \u201d will tell you that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions like the FDA , CDC , or WHO .\nThey will also try to discount any positive results using ad hominem attacks and smears , such as pointing out that a person may have at some time in the past , voiced \u201c anti-vaccine sentiments \u201d ( whatever that may be ) .\nYou can see an example here : https : //factcheck.afp.com/ivermectin-and-hydroxychloroquine-are-not-proven-covid-19-treatments A study which came out in The Lancet mid-2020 supposedly showing that HCQ was dangerous was subsequently withdrawn due to it being fraudulent .\nSadly , this withdrawal happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and HCQ had been successfully kicked to the curb in many places around the world \u2013 up to the point that in some jurisdictions doctors could be jailed for prescribing it .\nDespite all this , we must remember that science is not about following instructions from bureaucrats or from on-high , but rather doing empirical work and looking at the results .\nAnd , mobbing people who present a view that is different to what is politically correct is also not science .\nWhat matters is the data and , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As of this writing , 248 trials of HCQ used for treating COVID-19 have been completed , by 3,972 scientists , with 378,812 patients .\nWe can see 66 % improvement in 26 early treatment trials , 75 % improvement in 11 early treatment mortality results , and 24 % improvement in 35 randomised controlled trials .\nThese results are publicly available on a database that is tracking all HCQ studies to date .\nYou can see those studies here : https : //c19hcq.com We must also realise that HCQ , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both included in the WHO list of essential medicines !\nOf course \u201c fact checkers \u201d will give stern warnings about the fact that for COVID-19 the use of HCQ or Ivermectin is \u201c off label \u201d , meaning that they were previously used for treating other diseases and suggesting that therefore they can \u2019 t be used to treat COVID-19 .\nWhat they fail to mention is that doctors use all sorts of medicine \u201c off label \u201d all the time !\nSince Ivermectin and HCQ are both on the WHO list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time \u2013 decades in the case of HCQ \u2013 the world knows about the safety and dosage of these medicines , which means that even if they don \u2019 t effectively treat COVID-19 , there is no danger to patients from using these medicines .\nIt \u2019 s better than following official guidelines which were , to all intents and purposes , \u201c do nothing , stay home , and when you turn blue go to the hospital \u201d .\nThe thing is , there really is overwhelming evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivermectin has been demonstrated to be very effective at treating COVID-19 .\nWhile the fact checkers would have you believing otherwise , Ivermectin has been used very successfully in many places around the world where media hysteria did not get it banned from the shelves .\nJust this week , reports coming out of India are demonstrating massive benefits from Ivermectin .\nThere is already a 97 % decline in cases in New Delhi , India .\n4 other Indian states that are using Ivermectin now report decreases in cases by 60 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that have blocked the use of Ivermectin have increases in cases by several hundred percent \u2013 the exponential explosion that everyone is terrified of !\nAs The Desert Review says in their report , \u201c It is a clear refutation of the WHO , FDA , NIH , and CDC \u2019 s policies of \u201c wait at home until you turn blue \u201d before you get treatment.\n\u201d Before you buy into the line from \u201c Fact Checkers \u201d that these are only \u201c observational studies \u201d and haven \u2019 t been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials approved by the WHO , CDC , NIH , FDA etc .\nyou should know that 56 studies on Ivermectin , 17 of them being Randomised Controlled Trials , have clearly demonstrated very positive effects from Ivermectin .\nA site doing real-time meta-analysis of all the Ivermectin studies as they get published summarises the results as follows : \u201c 100 % of the 17 Randomised Controlled Trials ( RCTs ) for early treatment and prophylaxis report positive effects , with an estimated improvement of 73 % and 83 % respectively \u201d .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ The probability that an ineffective treatment generated results as positive as the 56 studies to date is estimated to be 1 in 2 trillion ( p = 0.00000000000041 ) .\n\u201d You can check this information yourself directly on their site https : //ivmmeta.com These treatments ( and others ) have , of course , been available since at least mid-2020 , but you may not have even heard of them until right now .\nThe reason is simple .\nThroughout 2020 and into 2021 , anybody trying to share this information ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would find themselves banned on most social media .\nMainstream Media would also not publish this information , but rather would engage in so-called \u201c fact-checking \u201d and smears against the people bringing this information to the world .\nThat in itself is a major red flag !\nWe need to ask , why would information that could save ( and is saving ) tens of thousands of lives around the world be blocked ?\nIn summary , and very importantly , we must understand that COVID-19 is not anything like a \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one of us down at any moment .\nIt is not everywhere , killing anyone it touches .\nAnd the above evidence shows us it is not true that there is a complete lack of any form of effective treatment .\nThis fact alone undermines the very basis of Emergency Use Authorization for all the COVID-19 vaccines .\nTherefore , all talk of coercion or making COVID-19 vaccination mandatory should be stopped now before it \u2019 s too late .\nBecause , when the lawsuits come \u2013 and they will come ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK , Canada and other places ) \u2013 the people on the stand for Nuremberg code violations will be company bosses , doctors , editors and government officials who pushed unsafe and unnecessary medical interventions onto a good-hearted , supportive , yet not-fully-informed public .\nRemember , the vaccine manufacturers have already negotiated legal immunity

Russia \u2019 s growing ties with Western Europe , an \u201c alternative \u201d infrastructure drive is being proposed that if and when completed , Washington , London , and Brussels hopes will further contain Russia and cut China off from European markets .\nIt \u2019 s called the \u201c Three Seas Initiative , \u201d and it is described in a recent Bloomberg op-ed titled , \u201c This Is How Europe Can Push Back Against China and Russia \u201d as : The op-ed argues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight off \u201c Russian bullying and Chinese meddling.\n\u201d But upon closer scrutiny \u2013 even the selling points made by the author \u2013 Andreas Kluth \u2013 reads instead like a thinly veiled attempt to bully and meddle in Europe \u2013 and at the expense of the obvious opportunities trade and ties with Russia and China will bring .\nKluth \u2019 s argument includes blaming the Soviet Union \u2019 s neglect of Eastern European nations as the reason they lack modern infrastructure today , claiming : Though economically vibrant , most of this region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in infrastructure .\nTravel by road and rail takes two to four times longer on average than in the rest of the EU .\nWhat \u2019 s missing in particular is good highways , railway tracks and gas pipes running north and south .\nThis is a legacy of the Cold War .\nThe Soviet hegemons made sure that Russian gas , tanks and troops could easily move east-west , but cared not a hoot about other connections among the countries they occupied .\nYet the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 \u2013 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still lacks modern infrastructure \u2013 it would be more appropriate to state that it is Brussels who \u201c cares not \u201d about making improvements .\nThe infrastructure proposed is also curious .\nThe op-ed claims : This is not necessary infrastructure though .\nEurope already has access to hydrocarbons in the form of Russian energy moved into the region through existing pipelines and at costs much cheaper than LNG shipped across the Atlantic from the United States will ever be .\nThe inclusion of this \u201c example \u201d reveals Kluth \u2019 s hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 this isn \u2019 t about stopping imagined \u201c Russian bullying , \u201d this is about imposing very real American bullying .\nIn other words , expensive infrastructure would be built specifically to put in place energy imports that would cost more and come with far more strings attached politically than Russian energy .\nThese strings would include \u2013 and the op-ed itself mentions this specifically \u2013 cutting off relations with both Moscow and Beijing .\nAnd regarding Beijing \u2013 Kluth accuses China of seeking political favor in return for infrastructure investments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of a partner nation \u201c compromised \u201d by its relationship with Beijing .\nKluth claims that Hungary has blocked EU condemnation of alleged \u201c human rights abuses \u201d by China \u2013 never considering that the accusations themselves may have been politically motivated in the first place by opponents of Beijing .\nKluth \u2013 after describing the Three Seas Initiative as a means of escaping \u201c bullying and meddling \u201d \u2013 makes clear that US and EU investment in the projects should themselves come with political strings attached \u2013 noting : While Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d remain squarely in the realm of politically-motivated accusations \u2013 Kluth is openly declaring Washington \u2019 s and Brussels \u2019 intentions to invest in a neglected Eastern Europe are predicated on acquiring unflinching obedience and the full surrender of national sovereignty \u2013 a proposition made without any hint of intentional irony .\nThree Seas Initiative : About Primacy , Not Progress US foreign policy has been and continues to be predicated on maintaining global primacy .\nAny nation , anywhere on Earth that challenges Washington \u2019 s ability to act upon the global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy and thus targeted through a combination of political , economic , and even military coercion .\nTwo nations that have found themselves on this list for decades are Russia and China .\nBoth Russia \u2019 s re-emergence after the collapse of the Soviet Union as a major global power and China \u2019 s rise both regionally in Asia and globally \u2013 have demonstrably inhibited Washington \u2019 s worst impulses .\nWhile Washington describes both Russia and China as threats to global peace and stability \u2013 it was Russia \u2019 s intervention in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar fate as Libya or Iraq at America \u2019 s hands .\nIt has been China \u2019 s incremental rise that has created viable alternatives for nations across Asia just now working their way out from under the shadow of America \u2019 s Indo-Pacific \u201c primacy \u201d \u2013 a notion still included openly as part of US foreign policy \u2013 demonstrated in a \u201c framework \u201d paper published as recently as the Trump administration .\nNotions of \u201c Russian bullying \u201d and \u201c Chinese meddling \u201d are geopolitical projections made by Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued campaign of coercion \u2013 and not just against Russia , China , and nations along their peripheries \u2013 but also against allied nations like Germany who seek to diversify their ties between East and West \u2013 US sanctions targeting German companies involved in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project with Russia being only the latest example .\nPerhaps the ultimate irony of all is that as Washington and Brussels attempt to dangle the promise of modern infrastructure over the heads of Eastern Europe \u2013 Kluth of Bloomberg himself admits that China has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungary \u2013 and Russia has been reliably pumping cheap energy into Eastern and Western Europe since before the collapse of the Soviet Union \u2013 and of course \u2013 ever since .\nOnce again , while pointing the accusing finger elsewhere \u2013 the US and its EU partners reveal themselves as the central threat to peace and prosperity .\nIn reality , Chinese infrastructure projects coupled with US-EU investments , and cheap energy from Russia would be most beneficial to the nations of both Eastern and Western Europe \u2013 but clearly what is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at counter to Washington \u2019

though that the Russians are coming .\nI know it upsets the Putin fans when I say it , but Russia \u2019 s share of the world economy has declined just as the G7 share has .\nAs Russia was always , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the G7 nations , the NATO attempt to portray Russia as a great threat is really rather silly .\nIf there is truth in the story of a couple of super military intelligence officers traveling widely but not killing many people , and of cunning Russian computer hackers engaging in cyber warfare while leaving cyrillic fingerprints behind , in a manner strangely identical to the CIA

team of experts isn \u2019 t announcing some new pivot on \u2018 The Science \u2019 of COVID-19 .\nIncreasingly , their decrees are becoming more arbitrary , and rather conspicuously geared towards leveraging even more restrictions , and driving record sales of corporate vaccines .\nEarlier this week , the government \u2019 s Chief Medical Officer and self-styled vaccinologist , Chris Whitty ( pictured above ) , boldly stated that the nation \u2019 s youth may need to get vaccinated \u2013 in order to ensure their education \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incredibly misleading because it wrongly infers that there \u2019 s a COVID pandemic among children , and that the only solution to this alleged crisis is to vaccinate them , all of them .\nThe only problem is that neither idea is true , according to almost all available data and peer reviewed studies .\nBut for some reason , these facts do not seem to deter politicians from pushing the current break-neck agenda .\nSo if the current political obsession to vaccinate children with the experimental COVID jab is not based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it based on ?\nNot surprising , Whitty and his cohort routinely omits the real science : that children are statistically at near zero risk of ever getting ill from the dreaded COVID-19 .\nThis is well known by many , and should be a central consideration in any qualified health professional \u2019 s calculus on whether children need to be jabbed en mass with what is effectively an unlicensed experimental gene therapy-based injection .\nUnfortunately , it \u2019 s always pushed to the back of the docket .\nMoreover , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any traditional sense of the word .\nBoth the manufacturers and the government openly admit that their new range of COVID jabs do not provide recipients with immunity , nor do they stop people from transmitting the virus after they are infected .\nThe only consistent claim by manufacturers is that their products \u201c reduce symptoms.\n\u201d Not much of a vaccine .\nMore crucially though is the fact that an entirely new risk is being introduced into childrens \u2019 health situation \u2013 the very real risk of severe adverse reactions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unproven pharmaceutical products .\nWhy would anyone wish to do that , especially those who have taken a Hippocratic oath \u201c to do no harm \u201d ?\nIt \u2019 s incredible how this fundamental point hardly factors into the analysis of those in high places pushing these jabs , especially with respect to administering them to children .\nIronically ( or not ) , the one group who has been the most militant in pushing for school closures and jabbing the children has been the teachers unions and those referred to as \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be rolled out to children , Prof Chris Whitty said the \u201c wider question \u201d was about whether this would help limit the disruption the virus was causing to their schooling .\nHis remarks come as the head of Britain \u2019 s biggest teaching union said children should be fully vaccinated before returning to school in September .\nIf the Government decides to vaccinate schoolchildren , this should happen \u201c as quickly as possible \u201d , said Kevin Courtney , the joint general secretary of the National Education Union .\nMinisters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaccination and Immunisation ( JCVI ) \u2013 which insiders expect will recommend the jab for younger teenagers \u2013 before they make a final decision .\nSo where are the regulatory bodies ?\nWhere are the checks and balances in government ?\nSome will be surprised to discover that the drive to jab the children is actually being facilitated by the very government agency that \u2019 s meant to restrain the pharmaceutical industry and corrupt ministers , that is Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) .\nDespite the fact this experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other jabs ) was allowed to flood the market on the

unprecedented feat of deregulation of normal medicine standards was sold to the public as necessary in order to \u201c protect the vulnerable \u201d as the main step in the government \u2019 s \u201c road map to freedom.\n\u201d Rather than stay true to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since then the government and its corporate media partners have become more aggressive in pushing to vaccinate the entire

2022 .\nAgain , this is beyond anyone normal person could have comprehended a year ago , although some key stakeholders seemed to have foreknowledge that this would be the agenda .\nThe waving of normal safety study and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinate the entire global population \u2013 is indeed unprecedented in human history .\nNot to mention the fact that even according to governments \u2019 own statistics , COVID-19 has a survival rate of around 99.97 % \u2013 roughly 100 % .\nYou have to admit , that \u2019 s pretty good odds for a pandemic .\nWhy are political leaders are in such hurry to jab as many people with these problematic products ?\nWhy , when all of the groups being pressured into accepting the genetic injection are not at all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less dying , from the 2020 seasonal respiratory illness ?\nOne of the main agents pushing this authoritarian vaccine agenda is UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock , who last month announced that the UK government had already

Schooling: \u2018This Year Has Been a Disgrace\u2019", "content": ".\nAfter 15 months of mindless draconian \u2018 mitigation \u2019 policies , few can rightly argue that teachers unions and school administrators haven \u2019 t been among the worst culprits in promoting hypochondria and the dumbing-down of the \u2018 pandemic \u2019 narrative .\nAt every stage of this virus panic , these two groups of professionals have traded on the outlandish and patently false claims that schools should be closed because children were somehow \u201c at risk \u201d from COVID-19 , and that their students are all potential \u201c asymptomatic spreaders \u201d of a deadly disease .\nBoth of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but despite being debunked repeated over the last year , education heads and their political enablers are still using this same raft of lies to enforce more abusive policies used to target children ; constant COVID testing , forced quarantines , and banning various group activities .\nThis same crazed pseudoscience has also been used to force children to wear masks for both indoor and outdoor activities .\nHowever , we must never lose sight of the most tragic part of all of this : that this protracted debacle will have ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lifetime educational , athletic and social experiences , as well as future opportunities in life .\nAstoundingly , many teachers went so far as to claim that student \u2018 spreaders \u2019 were threatening the lives of the teachers .\nA truly insane proposition , but one which was hardly ever opposed over the last year .\nThese same lies are now being used by teachers unions and governments to coerce children and families to accept the latest experimental genetic COVID-19 injection as a condition of returning to \u201c normal \u201d this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgrowths of the mass hysteria promoted by educators , teachers unions and government ministers has been the surrender of the children \u2019 s in-person educational experience in favour of so-called \u201c distance learning \u201d normally conducted online over Zoom or on other proprietary platforms .\nWhile this may have seemed convenient for many teachers and education executives \u2013 and for many families who were simply frightened to meet in groups due mainly to government and media fear campaigns being waged against them \u2013 for the majority of students and their families the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been an unmitigated disaster .\nFor those families with the means to hire private tutors , coaches , or join in high-end home schooling \u2018 pods , \u2019 the transition out of traditional school settings has been much easier .\nBut most parents can not afford such luxuries .\nThe result has been the a massive widening of an already giant income-education gap .\nSome contentious educators are beginning to speak out .\nI Taught Online School This Year .\nIt Was a Disgrace.\n\u201d She writes : The reality is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More shocking still is how some educators ( all of them on full pay and benefits ) treated with contempt any parents who dared to complain about the abysmal quality of the online \u2018 learning \u2019 being offered .\nSome educators sneered that the parents who complained just wanted free babysitting .\nBut I \u2019 m not ashamed to say that child care is at the heart of the work I do .\nI teach children reading and writing , yes , but I also watch over them , remind them to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and activities to help them grow .\nChildren deserve attentive care .\nThat \u2019 s the core of our commitment to them .\nRather than take such concerns on board and possibly reevaluate the basis for shuttering their schools , a new breed of high-minded health and safety mavens adopted an even more condescending attitude towards parents , and staunchly defended the most outrageous COVID policies , while constantly claiming that \u2018 there was no alternative.\n\u2019 Of course , there were always alternatives ( see Sweden ) , but it was easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then go to the government for the additional money that was suddenly on offer .\nThis bred a new strata of institutional corruption never seen before .\nI am still bewildered and horrified that our society walked away from this responsibility , that we called school inessential and left each family to fend for itself .\nMeanwhile nurses , bus drivers and grocery workers all went to work in person \u2014 most of my students \u2019 parents went to work in person \u2014 not because it was safe but because their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids are all right \u201d Facebook memes .\nSome children may have learned to do laundry or enjoy nature during the pandemic .\nMany others suffered trauma and disconnection that will take years to repair .\nIf you can see through the barrage of digital utopia advertising and marketing by Big Tech firms like Microsoft and Google , you \u2019 ll quickly realise just how shallow the new COVID culture of \u2018 remote learning \u2019 truly is .\nWhile virtual learning has proven to be very practical and cost-effective for parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has obviously has failed this generation of children .\nDoes virtual learning work for some kids , in some circumstances ?\nSure .\nSo does home-schooling , or not attending school at all .\nBut I am profoundly relieved that most districts , including my own , plan to shut down or restrict the online option .\nSEE ALSO : COVID School Closures Are a Disaster : Three Perspectives By now , there are many studies you can point to which demonstrate what a failure the COVID \u2018 distance learning \u2019 experiment has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in USA Today , entitled , \u201c Scores of students are getting F \u2019 s : What \u2019 s the point of failing them during COVID-19 ?\n\u201c , another disturbing aspect of the disaster was revealed : educators are now using COVID to abandon grades altogether \u2013 in effect , drastically lowering expectations and standards for the next generation .\nWhile a recent Rand Corp. study found just 6 in 10 U.S. teachers are assigning letter grades this fall , that rate is nearly double what it was in this past spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts across the country , from Virginia to Hawaii .\nAnd those F \u2019 s tend to be concentrated among low-income students of color , data indicate , as well as those who are still learning to speak English or have disabilities .\nThe trend raises questions about the culture of grading in general \u2013 especially at a time when achievement is so influenced by factors beyond students \u2019 control .\n\u201c Traditional grading practices aren \u2019 t just giving us inaccurate information ; they \u2019 re also inequitable , \u201d said Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with schools to improve grading practices and wrote the book \u201c Grading for Equity.\n\u201d The ramifications of this are incomprehensible and have the power to permanently alter the trajectory of modern civilisation \u2013 transitioning from a merit-based system of education , to a political identity-based \u2018 equity , \u2019 or communist system , where students are awarded for their participation rather than for actual performance or achievement .\nWe would do well not to shy away from this debate , as the wheels of history are already in motion .\nAgain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy class perfectly , but it will most certainly wipe out the middle class , and with it any chance of meritocratic upward mobility for future generations .\nThis raft of lies is still being pushed by corrupt corporate cartels and government officials .\nThe fact that all of this has been fuelled by pseudoscientific lies parroted by teachers unions and politicians makes it even more difficult to shallow , considering how these teachers are meant to be entrusted with education of our children \u2013 not brainwashing them and

when things don \u2019 t make sense , in which case I find myself drawn into exploring what might be really going on .\nSo , in early 2020 when the panic about COVID-19 started to spread around the world , like most other people I accepted the logic that we needed to \u201c flatten the curve \u201d so that hospitals would not be overwhelmed .\nAfter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what was going on , or how serious this new disease might be .\nAnd reports from front-line medical staff about the symptoms being experienced by COVID-19 patients made for gruesome reading .\nAt the beginning it made sense to be very careful .\nBut , as the months went on , it became increasingly difficult to match what was being reported in the media with what we could observe using our own senses .\nI knew of no-one who had died of COVID-19 .\nNo-one who had even gotten sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t any dead bodies piling up in the streets .\nThis now makes sense because mortality data for Hong Kong , and other Asian countries where I also spend time , show that 2020 was a very normal year as far as overall mortality levels were concerned .\nGlobally it was a little different .\nMost of the people I connect with around the world also didn \u2019 t know anyone who had died of COVID .\nOne neighbor knew someone ( in Russia ) who got very sick but then recovered .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is in his 70 \u2019 s , was put into intensive care for several weeks and a few other people I follow on twitter had a family member who got very sick or died .\nClearly there was an issue , but the data coming in about the scope and severity did not mesh with what we were being told through the media .\nImportantly , the predictive models coming out of Imperial College in the UK assumed that almost no-one was immune to COVID-19 , that it was both incredibly infectious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that millions would die .\nWe must remember , of course , that the author of the Imperial College report , Neil Fergusson , who has a history of extreme overestimations .\nIn 2005 as just one example , Ferguson predicted that up to 150 million people could be killed from bird flu .\nIn the end , only 282 people died worldwide from the disease between 2003 and 2009 .\nNever mind Fergusson \u2019 s \u201c checkered history \u201d , immediately after the Fergusson models were published the media around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black death \u201d was about to crush us , and that deaths from COVID-19 were mounting up at a terrifying rate .\nWe were told that we had to be afraid \u2026 .\nVery afraid .\nWhile clearly something was going on , and there were people dying , more and more thoughtful and highly skilled people around the world began to wonder about the disconnect between the media hype and the reality on the ground .\nThe big question was , how serious and deadly was this pandemic really ?\nAbout that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic tenet of scientific research , which came in the form of an admonition that we should be wary of the distinction between \u201c DYING OF \u201d COVID-19 , and \u201c DYING WITH \u201d COVID-19 .\nThis basically refers to the fact that one should NEVER equate correlation with causality .\nYou may have noticed that we are being reminded of this fact every day now , as the COVID vaccines get rolled out and there are many adverse reactions .\nWe are told that , just because someone gets paralyzed , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or dies from blood clots within hours or days of being jabbed with the experimental \u201c vaccines \u201d , we absolutely should not assume that these \u201c vaccines \u201d actually CAUSED the injury or death .\nThis is true .\nAnd for each of the deaths , an autopsy should be performed to identify the actual cause .\nYet , for some strange reason , this very same basic premise was , and is , totally ignored when it comes to COVID-19 .\nFrom Day 1 of the pandemic , every death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted and reported as a death CAUSED BY COVID-19 .\nFor instance , at a press conference given by the Director of the Illinois Department of Health in April 2020 , when asked about the definition of a COVID-19 death , the answer was : \u201c It means technically even if you died of a clear alternate cause , but you had COVID at the same time , it \u2019 s still listed as a COVID death .\n\u201d You can view the original news story here : https : //week.com/2020/04/20/idph-director-explains-how-covid-deaths-are-classified/ This same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because every country is following guidelines coming from the WHO ( World Health Organization ) .\nFor example , the recommended death reporting form for COVID-19 from the WHO is structured in such a way that , if COVID-19 is written on the form even if there are other factors , then COVID-19 be listed as the .\nThe WHO guidelines state : \u201c \u2026 in a or confirmed COVID-19 case \u2026.. A death due to COVID-19 may not be attributed to another disease ( e.g .\ncancer ) .\n\u201d The WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found here : https : //www.who.int/classifications/icd/Guidelines_Cause_of_Death_COVID-19.pdf ?\nua=1 Problems surrounding the sudden revision of death certificate protocols have been discussed by medical professionals throughout 2020 , but this topic is treated as verboten in mainstream media and politics .\nIn practice this means that when people who were already on their deathbed die , they will be marked as a COVID-19 death based on an assumption ( i.e .\n\u201c probable \u201d COVID-19 ) or a PCR test .\nSo , unless there \u2019 s an autopsy , the public record shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it comes to using the PCR test to determine cause of death , CDC ( US Centers for Disease Control ) guidance states : \u201c The detection of viral RNA ( i.e .\nPCR test ) can not demonstrate the presence of an infectious virus , or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent of clinical symptoms.\n\u201d ( Source : https : //www.fda.gov/media/134922/download ) In other words : we simply can not use a PCR test to determine that a death was caused by COVID-19 , and yet this is what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months .\nThere are also serious problems in the PCR test which I wrote about in a recent China Daily article .\nFrom the above we can begin to understand a major issue .\nBecause of the way COVID-19 deaths were ( and are ) being reported , if we did not dig deep into the data we would have no real idea of the scale of deaths actually caused directly and only by SARS-Cov-2 , as opposed to the number of deaths that would have happened anyway where COVID-19 was somehow associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean that COVID-19 actually caused the death ) .\nSEE ALSO : Under Duress : Are Coerced COVID-19 Vaccinations Proportionate ?\nSo , let \u2019 s dig into the data .\nA simple first step is to simply look at the age distribution of people dying and having COVID-19 on their death certificate .\nToday the average life expectancy in the UK is around 81 years of age .\nDid you know that the average age of death \u201c involving COVID-19 \u201d in the UK was 82 years of age ?\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked deaths occurred in people 55 years old or older , with 80.73 % being over 65 .\nRead more here : https : //www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/23/coronavirus-covid-deaths-us-age-race-14863 In Hong Kong , from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic until now , only 210 people have died with COVID-19 marked as the cause ( based of course on the WHO guidelines mentioned above ) .\nThe average age ?\n78.2 years .\n28 of those deaths were in their 90 \u2019 s and only 2 people just under 40 died with COVID-19 listed as the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong Department of Health , no-one younger than 38 has died either OF , or WITH , COVID-19 in Hong Kong .\nSee the official figures here : https : //www.chp.gov.hk/files/xls/previous_cases_covid19_en.xlsx With this new understanding we now know that while COVID-19 is clearly dangerous for certain at-risk groups \u2013 almost exclusively elderly people \u2013 the danger level of the pandemic to society as a whole is substantially less than what we have been led to believe .\nIt \u2019 s also very useful to look at official data such as that regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 9 , 2021 , the CDC report that , in total , 586,659 people have died having COVID-19 listed as a cause or contributing cause of death in the US .\nYou probably do not know this , because the majority of the MSM will not have put this in front of you , but late in 2020 the CDC quietly changed the information on their website to start showing how many so-called COVID-19 deaths occurred for people who had serious co-morbidities .\nThis is no trivial change in data reporting .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting , when you scroll down you see a table showing all the co-morbidities of the people who died with COVID-19 being listed as the cause of death : https : //www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/mortality-overview.htm The note associated with that table reads : \u201c There were co-morbidities or other conditions listed on the death certificate for as many as 95 % of all COVID-19 deaths .\nThe other 5 % of death certificates in which COVID-19 was the only condition listed was likely related to a lack of detail listed about other conditions present at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only 29,332 people have died in the US with COVID-19 as the only known cause .\nHowever , the entire world continues to believe that all 586,659 \u201c COVID-19 linked \u201d deaths in the US were CAUSED BY COVID-19 , simply as a result of how data was captured and entered into the public record , and how it was publicized by the media .\nThe Case of the Disappearing Flu A slightly different way of understanding all this information is the fact that COVID-19 seems to have cured the flu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other serious conditions .\nData comparing flu cases around the world have shown that the flu completely disappeared worldwide since the emergence of COVID-19 .\nSome medical pundits are claiming the flu has disappeared because of the effectiveness of masks and social distancing .\nBut this is has yet to be proven through any peer reviewed studies , and so it is still only a working theory at this point .\nThis theory posits that it is because of the effectiveness of coronavirus measures ; lockdowns , masks and social distancing \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is problematic as it doesn \u2019 t explain why these same measures did not stop COVID-19 .\nIn response , those defending the disappearing flu narrative will usually claim that COVID couldn \u2019 t be stopped because it is \u2018 much more transmissible.\n\u2019 Hence , the disappearing flu story can then be used to validate the official consensus that SARS-Cov-2 is unlike any other virus seen before , and has special abilities which allowed it to traverse the globe and penetrate populations in a matter of weeks .\nWhile the authors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public health measures taken to keep the coronavirus from spreading also stop the flu \u201d , there is a much greater likelihood that influenza cases were simply being coded as COVID-19 .\nSo , in summary , we can say that many but not all of the deaths labelled as being due to COVID-19 alone were quite likely due to other causes .\nAlso , individuals with compromised immune systems were very vulnerable to the spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 virus .\nIt is the spike protein which appears to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all of these cases , however , we can not say how many of those deaths were actually caused BY COVID-19 alone without the autopsies that would be required to make such a judgement .\nAll we can say with certainty is that COVID-19 was correlated with these deaths .\nThe entire global media almost as a whole have ignored this distinction , along with other very important distinctions in this pandemic , and sold the story that all the deaths reported were CAUSED by COVID-19 , and that we therefore had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look around , we see the massive damage that this fear has created in our world .\nAgain we face the question , why was fake news spread around the world in this way by the mainstream media ?\nWas it simply a matter of scientific illiteracy ?\nMaybe it was simply laziness , or a lack of curiosity ?\nWas it because \u201c death sells \u201d , and the more horrible the numbers the more viewers would be drawn into the drama and therefore build the ratings for the media ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will deal with issues such as these in future articles in this series .\nIn the meantime , given what the data now tells us , it is time to stop the panicking and let go of the fear .\n*** Author Chris Lonsdale is a psychologist , linguist , educator , entrepreneur , dialogue facilitator and corporate advisor

Mandates Violate Medical Ethics", "content": "It \u2019 s incredible when you think about it .\nNot only do US colleges require most students to take on six-figure debts in order to pay for their higher education , but now these same wealthy institutions are now requiring that student subject themselves to medical experiments as a condition of being allowed on campus .\nThis situation is unprecedented , and at present there is still no visible pushback happening in either the press , or in political conversation .\n\u201c If we are going to put out a vaccine and we are going to say we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we better be hawks on safety .\nIndependent data safety and monitoring boards , we better be looking at every event being reported in every safety database and assure America that the program is safe\u2026 \u201d He adds , \u201c There is the principle of autonomy .\nThis is very important .\nIt is written into the Nuremberg Code .\nWe live by it every day .\nIt says the person , the individual , gets to decide what happens to their body.\n\u201d Indeed , for millions of students in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed aside in this new and increasingly fascistic culture of \u2018 health and safety.\n\u2019 When pressed on the matter , school administrators will just as soon shrug their shoulders and say , \u2018 Well , what else can we do ?\nEveryone else is doing the same.\n\u2019 None of it is legal either .\nAs US legal precedent shows , by using coercion by effectively blackmailing young students ( who happen to be at roughly zero risk of ever getting ill from COVID-19 ) universities are acting outside the law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginalising the lives of their young students by treating them like glorified human guinea pigs .\nAaron Kheriaty and Gerard V. Bradley wrote the following impactful opinion-editorial for the Wall Street Journal\u2026 Some 450 U.S. colleges and universities\u2014including our institutions\u2014have announced policies mandating that all students be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 before the fall semester , with some requiring vaccination now for the summer term .\nSchools have for decades required vaccination against infectious diseases , but these mandates are unprecedented\u2014and unethical .\nNever before have colleges insisted that students or employees receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance or employment .\nEven soldiers , whose rights are constrained when they join the service , aren \u2019 t being compelled to take a Covid vaccine .\nIn a case involving a vaccine against anthrax , a federal district judge held in 2004 that \u201c the United States can not demand that members of the armed forces also serve as guinea pigs for experimental drugs \u201d absent informed consent or a presidential waiver of service members \u2019 legal protections .\nThe following year the judge held that an emergency-use authorization from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the legal test .\nThe FDA has issued such authorizations for three Covid vaccines , but it hasn \u2019 t fully approved any of them .\nStudents at Notre Dame ( for example ) resume classes on Aug. 23 , and freshmen arrive on campus Aug. 18 .\nThe Pfizer vaccine\u2014first in line for approval\u2014requires three weeks before the booster shot , so it would have to be approved by July 28 for students to meet the school \u2019 s deadline without making themselves experimental subjects .\nPfizer applied to the FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d a process that usually takes six months .\nUniversities might counter that\u2014as with elementary schools requiring pediatric vaccinations\u2014immunization is for students \u2019 own good .\nBut children can be at significant medical risks from the illnesses that we vaccinate them against , particularly when community vaccination rates are low .\nNot so with Covid .\nFor those under 30 , the risks of serious morbidity and mortality are close to zero .\nBy contrast , early indications from passive surveillance systems ( which call for follow-up investigation ) and a June 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee indicated an excess risk for heart inflammation , especially in men 30 and younger .\nColleges \u2019 vaccine mandates also ignore the huge number of students\u2014thousands of them at Notre Dame\u2014who have already recovered from Covid infection , and who thus possess natural immunity , which studies have suggested is more robust and durable than vaccine immunity .\nWhile vaccinating Covid-recovered patients might produce an antibody uptick , there is no epidemiological evidence that this improves relevant clinical outcomes like reinfection or transmissibility .\nPrevious infection can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s own records of testing throughout the past school year , a positive viral test from another provider or an antibody test , which would prove either natural immunity or vaccination .\nForced vaccinations would also commandeer populations that were deliberately excluded from clinical trials , thus subjecting them to novel experimental risks .\nThis includes not only patients who \u2019 ve recovered from Covid , but pregnant and breast-feeding women as well .\nThese coercive mandates violate basic principles of medical ethics .\nEven if the vaccines receive full FDA approval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify forcing vaccinations on healthy young adults who are at minimal risk of hospitalization or death from Covid , especially those who already had Covid .\nWe don \u2019 t immunize children against diseases that primarily harm the elderly in hope of reducing transmission risks for the elderly .\nThat would use the recipients as a means to another end , which is unethical .\nConsider the analogy of nontherapeutic research , from which the research subject doesn \u2019 t stand to benefit directly .\nThe central canon of medical ethics in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the research subject , as articulated in the Nuremberg Code and the Helsinki Declaration .\nInformed consent is likewise required for medical decisions in all adults of sound mind .\nThis is arguably the most deeply rooted doctrine in contemporary medical ethics .\nA person may freely choose to accept medical risks for the benefit of others , as when one donates a kidney for transplant .\nBut there is no moral duty to do so .\nThis is why we don \u2019 t harvest organs without consent , even if doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who make such sacrifices for others must truly be volunteers , not conscripts drafted by college administrators .\nUniversity leaders might claim that vaccine mandates are necessary to make faculty , staff and students \u201c feel safe \u201d enough to reopen .\nThat \u2019 s specious .\nRequiring the naturally immune to be vaccinated doesn \u2019 t make anyone actually safer .\nIt is wrong to risk harming healthy people so that college can peddle a psychological placebo to those who don \u2019 t care enough to consider basic scientific facts .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is precisely in dire situations , such as wars or pandemics , that we are most sorely tempted to abandon ethical principles .\nAuthorities rushing to implement mandatory vaccination protocols are ignoring available scientific data , basic principles of immunology and elementary norms .\nEven if some sincerely think that these regimes are needed to open safely , that belief neither makes it so nor justifies coercive policies that steamroll fundamental liberties .\nDr. Kheriaty is a professor of psychiatry and director of the Medical Ethics Program at

Mandalay , the Southeast Asian state \u2019 s second largest city .\nThe uptick in violence was entirely predictable .\nMyanmar \u2019 s opposition , the product of decades of US and British government backing and part of a much wider bid by the West to reassert primacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retake power and continue cutting ties with neighboring China including blocking Beijing \u2019 s One Belt

: The so-called \u201c people \u2019 s defense forces \u201d have been carrying out armed terrorist attacks across the country and in populated areas for months , including in Mandalay .\nThis includes not only attacks on police and military targets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public offices and even schools .\nOpposition media such as US National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) funded \u201c Myanmar

platform include , \u201c As spate of killings continues , anti-junta forces warn of more to come.\n\u201d The article attempts to justify the violence as a means to \u201c resist the junta \u2019 s repression.\n\u201d The article claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called \u201c people \u2019 s defense force \u201d mentioned by CNN took responsibility for the school attack , claiming : The group \u2019 s

attempts and 18 arson attacks have targeted schools in the country .\nThe article also admitted that : The US-backed opposition has touted its \u201c civil disobedience movement \u201d ( CDM ) but only a minority have joined it \u2013 including across the nation \u2019 s many educational institutes .\nThe Reuters article itself admits that little more than a quarter of the nation \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorist attacks on teachers , students , and schools \u2013 as well as all other public facilities that attempt to continue as normal \u2013 designed to grind the rest of the government to a halt .\nBoth Reuters and CNN cite the so-called Assistance Association for Political Prisoners ( AAPP ) for updated death and detention tallies .\nNot mentioned by either Reuters or CNN is that AAPP is funded by the US government through the same NED funding opposition groups across Myanmar .\nAAPP \u2019 s founder and joint secretary \u2013 Ko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ webpage on the NED \u2019 s official website as part of an NED fellowship .\nIt also isn \u2019 t mentioned that AAPP is based in neighboring Thailand , not Myanmar .\nCNN \u2019 s article also features a video of supposed members of \u201c people \u2019 s defense forces \u201d receiving military training in camps located in rural Myanmar and operated by armed ethnic groups backed for decades by the US and British governments .\nThis support includes material support and military training provided by supposed nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by ex-US military personnel who work with separaist groups while maintaining contact with US embassies in both Myanmar and neighbouring Thailand , leaked diplomatic cables reveal .\nThe trainees can be seen operating variants of the M-16 service rifle \u2013 an American made war weapon found in abundance among separatist groups who have been fighting Myanmar \u2019 s central government for decades .\nThese trained militants then filter back into urban centers where they have been carrying out a campaign of armed terrorism even the Western media has admitted to \u2013 albeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious foreign-backed nature of the armed violence aimed at Myanmar \u2019 s central government , the UN General Assembly , according to CNN , has attempted to hinder the nation \u2019 s military in restoring order .\nThe November election , however ,

Albright .\n, in addition to receiving significant financial and political support from the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis includes Australian economist Sean Turnell who also had contacts with USAID , the US State Department itself , and was an adviser for convicted financial criminal George Soros \u2019 Open Society Foundation which is also deeply involved in interfering in Myanmar \u2019 s internal political affairs .\nTurnell worked with Aung San Suu Kyi ( image , left ) on reconfiguring Myanmar \u2019 s economy and in particular pivoting it away from China and toward the predatory financial arms of the West , specifically the IMF and World Bank .\nAiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s legal system \u2013 including the rewriting of Myanmar \u2019 s constitution \u2013 was Robert San Pe \u2013 a British citizen .\nAlso aiding Aung San Suu Kyi was Joseph Fisher who \u2013 while serving as Aung San Suu Kyi \u2019 s adviser \u2013 was also working for the British government \u2019 s Foreign Office .\nHe had previously served at the British embassy in Myanmar .\nIn this light , the February take-over by Myanmar \u2019 s military is revealed as urgently necessary .\nThe country had been essentially captured with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving as merely an indigenous face for what was essentially a foreign-managed administration .\nThe subsequent \u201c National Unity Government \u201d ( NUG ) backed by the US and seeking to contest the military \u2019 s control over the country , is made up of several senior opposition leaders who have likewise been drawn from US government-funded fronts interfering in Myanmar \u2019 s internal political affairs .\nThe West is now mobilizing its regime change machinery to place the NUG back into power \u2013 regime change machinery finely honed across North Africa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab Spring , \u201d in Eastern Europe in Ukraine and more recently Belarus , and of course across Asia in places like Hong Kong and even neighboring Thailand where US-backed opposition groups are still taking to the streets .\nIn fact , protests across Asia have been lumped together into a US State Department project referred to as the \u201c Milk Tea Alliance \u201d in which US-backed opposition groups from Hong Kong , Taiwan , Thailand , Malaysia , Myanmar , and other targeted nations openly coordinate their activities both to remove their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinate attacks on China itself .\nChina is the largest trade partner and investor in virtually every nation in the region .\nIt is also the largest source of tourism and a key partner in major infrastructure-building campaigns .\nChina also supplies military equipment to many nations in the region including nations like Thailand who are replacing their aging US-made arsenels with modern Chinese alternatives .\nThus , just like the \u201c Arab Spring \u201d was meant to create an arc of chaos across an entire region with the aim of encircling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , the \u201c Milk Tea Alliance \u201d and the coordinated , region-wide instability and now armed violence it entails , aims to do likewise against China .\nSlash and Burn Approach to Blocking China \u2019 s One Belt , One Road It \u2019 s no secret that the US is opposed to China \u2019 s One Belt , One Road ( OBOR ) initiative \u2013 Beijing \u2019 s global infrastructure building-spree that has already seen multiple continent-spanning infrastructure projects built and put into operation with many more either under construction or being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is countering China \u2019 s OBOR initiative through its own infrastructure campaigns including the \u201c Blue Dot Network \u201d and the recently unveiled \u201c Build Back Better World \u201d ( B3W ) \u2013 both of which mention competition with China as their primary motivation .\nHowever , even on paper these proposed alternatives fall flat \u2013 and worse still \u2013 they have remained solely proposals on paper with not even a single actual infrastructure project even proposed .\nSupposed \u201c development \u201d agencies involved in these proposals include USAID , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Despite including the word \u201c development \u201d in its name , USAID does not actually drive development .\nInstead , it is a tool used to consolidate control over a targeted nation .\nThis is best illustrated in its inclusion in many US government \u201c counterinsurgency \u201d manuals , including one published this year ( PDF ) by the Joint Chiefs of Staff which mentions USAID by name at least 40 times .\nSuch manuals are

Washington \u2019 s client regime of choice .\nUSAID \u2019 s role in this process is to provide the basic necessities for populations in order to undermine the authority of political factions slated for dissolution by the US .\nUnable to compete on equal terms with Chinese-built infrastructure , the US has adopted another entirely different strategy to deal with the OBOR initiative \u2013 a strategy of slash and burn .\nIt seeks to utilize agencies like USAID to undermine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China and to minimize the positive effects these infrastructure projects will have on populations by offering localized but entirely inadequate alternatives together with the promise of US backing for separatist activities .\nLiterally everywhere China \u2019 s OBOR reaches , the US is funding and backing opposition groups to protest against proposals , physically attack construction sites , and attempt to overthrow the governments signing deals with China and enjoying the benefits of jointly developed infrastructure .\nEverywhere from Pakistan \u2019 s southwestern Baluchistan province where US-backed separatists have attacked Chinese construction crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 to Thailand where US-backed opposition parties are proposing the non-existent \u201c hyperloop \u201d as an alternative to Thai-Chinese high-speed rail projects \u2013 the US is using a combination of political subversion and armed terrorism/separatism to sabotage and obsruct China \u2019 s OBOR .\nIn Myanmar a thorough combination of all these techniques has been applied , and applied for many years .\nWikileaks revealed in a 2010 US diplomatic cable titled , \u201c Burma : Grassroots Opposition to Chinese-backed Dam in Northern Burma , \u201d that US diplomats discussed the success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocking Chinese-initiated dams .\nThe cable noted : An unusual aspect of this case is the role grassroots organizations have played in opposing the dam , which speaks to the growing strength of civil society groups in Kachin State , including recipients of Embassy small grants .\nOnce projects like dams , roads , rails , or ports are blocked in targeted nations like Myanmar , no Western alternative is ever offered .\nInstead , organizations like USAID provide provisional infrastructure like solar panels and ad-hoc water towers providing recipient communities with minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupt unifying national projects and encourage local communities to make do without modern infrastructure .\nThis in itself is arresting development across entire regions \u2013 allowing the US to artificially maintain \u201c primacy \u201d over them .\nThis also contributes to separatism , creating communities dependent on US handouts rather than working with their own nation \u2019 s government \u2013 which in Myanmar in particular has been the source of decades of armed conflict .\nThis conflict also further arrests development .\nAll of this is in stark contrast to China \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is transporting goods and people across entire regions and providing food , energy , and water for a growing number of people around the globe \u2013 all without political strings attached or armies of foreign-funded \u201c activists \u201d commandeering national policymaking and in turn , hijacking national sovereignty .\nNations have already tangibly benefited from Chinese-led infrastructure projects \u2013 including nations like Myanmar where projects have been completed .\nThese include roads , bridges , and dams .\nThe Irrawaddy Bridge ( also known as the Yadanabon Bridge ) built by China CAMC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example \u2013 finally allows heavy vehicles to cross the Irrawaddy River from the nation \u2019 s northwest to Mandalay and the nation \u2019 s interior beyond without using cumbersome ferries .\nAlso built with China \u2019 s help is the Yeywa Dam commissioned in 2010 .\nIt includes the nation \u2019 s largest hydroelectric power plant , providing energy to nearby Mandalay .\nIt also significantly contributes to flood control .\nOpposed to its construction was the so-called \u201c Burma Rivers Network \u201d \u2013 an extension of \u201c International Rivers \u201d \u2013 funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Ford Foundation , and the Sigrid Rausing Trust \u2013 all admittedly working in parallel with fronts like USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy to advance US government foreign policy objectives .\nBefore the dam \u2019 s completion , Burma Rivers Network made claims including that the power would \u201c likely \u201d be \u201c transmitted to China \u201d \u2013 a claim that was and is completely false .\nThe network also made baseless claims that villagers were \u201c forcibly relocated without compensation \u201d and that the dam would jeopardize their livelihood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logging along the river \u2013 a livelihood necessitated by a previous lack of infrastructure needed for modern and sustainable economic opportunities .\nAs other adjacent projects to the Yeywa Dam are either proposed or in the process of being built \u2013 these same US-backed networks work tirelessly to derail compensation , relocation , and even public hearings to discuss either in the first place .\nIn some cases , like the proposed and partially constructed Myitsone Dam , work has been halted not only by US-funded opposition groups politically obstructing progress , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups .\nIn a 2014 article in The Guardian entitled , \u201c Burmese villagers exiled from ancestral home as fate of dam remains unclear , \u201d they would admit : As work got underway , the Kachin Independence Army broke a 17-year-old ceasefire to attack the dam site .\nIn 2010 , 10 bombs exploded around the dam site , killing a Chinese worker .\nKachin separatism is openly encouraged by the US as revealed through a series of leaked cables and the US government \u2019 s funding of Kachin separatist groups listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s official website .\nFollowing Libya into the Mass Grave of Developing Nations It is very clear that Myanmar has benefited from jointly developed infrastructure projects with China .\nIt is also very clear that should these projects continue to be built , reaching into hitherto remote regions where US-backed separatists are based and modern economic opportunities made available , the swamp of US-sponsored divide-and-conquer would begin to be drained .\nMyanmar is one of the weakest links in China \u2019 s Southeast Asian periphery , a loose shingle the US hopes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regards to China \u2019 s growing relationship with the nations in the region and cut its OBOR initiative off as part of a much wider campaign of encircling and containing China \u2019 s rise .\nOne needs not speculate as to the likely outcome in Myanmar should US intervention run full course .\nLibya in 2011 was targeted by a similar campaign of political subversion coupled with armed terrorism which \u2013 when eventually backed by US military support and intervention \u2013 led to the dissolution of the Libyan government in 2011 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state comprised of multiple warring factions .\nLibya \u2019 s collapse in 2011 led to the direct dispersal of militants and weapons in all directions , destabilizing the rest of North Africa as well as fuelling US-sponsored militancy in Syria .\nA similar scenario where refugees and militants plague the rest of Southeast Asia for years to come is already unfolding in Myanmar .\nHow bad it gets depends on both the Myanmar military \u2019 s own ability to restore order within its borders and Myanmar \u2019 s neighbors \u2019 ability to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and instability already spilling over the border .\nWashington \u2019 s ability to increase pressure on Myanmar \u2019 s military depends partly on the West \u2019 s ability to control the narrative surrounding the unfolding conflict .\nThe Western media has worked ceaselessly to portray Myanmar \u2019 s military as \u201c undemocratic \u201d and its response to what are now clearly armed opposition groups as \u201c disproportionate.\n\u201d US-funded \u201c human rights \u201d groups have produced a steady stream of \u201c statistics \u201d and \u201c activist claims \u201d to fill up Western news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify further pressure from the US through institutions like the UN .\nIt is a similar pattern the US and its allies used both in Libya and in Syria from 2011 onward , as well as in Ukraine in 2013-2014 , and more recently in Hong Kong and Thailand .\nThe success or failure of US slash and burn policy in Myanmar will set the tone for its wider Indo-Pacific strategy and its wider still international rivalry with China .\nAnd while it is always easier to destroy than to build , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s reputation is tarnished , it is difficult if not impossible to rehabilitate it .\nFor Washington , it is a race between destroying fast enough to outpace the global public \u2019 s growing awareness of its tactics and those being used to carry them out \u2013 and all of this versus China \u2019 s clearly more constructive and desirable strategy of building and trading .\n*** Author Brian Berletic , formerly known under his pen name \u201c Tony Cartalucci , \u201d is Bangkok-based geopolitical researcher , writer and

"source": "21stcenturywire", "title": "How Governments Are Ignoring Natural COVID Immunity", "content": "It \u2019 s one of the biggest pseudo science cons in history \u2013 the idea currently being promoted by government officials and the media that natural immunity can not protect you against the greatest viral pathogen in human history , the \u2018 novel \u2019 coronavirus .\nLast month , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in Washington issued a statement saying that SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests should not be used to determine immunity or protection against COVID-19 .\nThe agency did not clarify why they suddenly decreed this latest \u2018 science \u2019 decision .\nIt was just left there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloof , self-referential authority that the public has become accustomed to over the last 16 months during this so-called \u2018 global pandemic.\n\u2019 The only logical answer here is that the US government , in collusion with the transnational corporate vaccine cartel , are attempting to herd the population into a carefully designed cul de sac governed by a fraudulent PCR testing trap , whilst simultaneously coercing the population to accept the unlicensed experimental genetic \u2018 vaccine \u2019 injections .\nWhy ?\nUpon closer examination , it appears that the antigen ( antibody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of the individual , and away from the oppressive government \u2018 public health \u2019 machine and its pharmaceutical industrial complex .\nIn this sense , any acknowledgement of natural immunity of a human is met with distain and ridicule by the pandemic pushers .\nMoreover , a positive antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 would also logically mean that the state or a corporation could not compel or force an individual to inject any of these potentially dangerous experimental \u2018 vaccines \u2019 being pushed aggressively by governments and their many \u2018 stakeholders.\n\u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move by the FDA , but it \u2019 s very much in keeping with every other illogical move they \u2019 ve made over the past 15 months .\nEpidemiologists estimate over 160 million people worldwide have recovered from COVID-19 .\nThose who have recovered have an astonishingly low frequency of repeat infection , disease , or death .\nThat immunity from prior infection protects many people now where vaccines are not yet available .\nEarlier this month the World Health Organization released a scientific update stating that most people who have recovered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nImportantly , they summarize that within 4 weeks of infection , 90 % to 99 % of people who recover from COVID-19 develop detectable neutralizing antibodies .\nFurthermore , they conclude \u2014 given the limited amount of time to observe cases \u2014 that the immune response remains strong for at least 6 to 8 months after infection .\nThis update echoes what the NIH reported in January 2021 : The immune response of more than 95 % of people who recovered from COVID-19 had durable memories of the virus up to 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further to state that those findings \u201c provide hope \u201d that people who get vaccinated will develop similar lasting immunity .\nSo why are we so focused on vaccine-induced immunity \u2014 in our goals to reach herd immunity , our gatekeeping on travel , public or private events , or mask use \u2014 while ignoring natural immunity ?\nShouldn \u2019 t those who have natural immunity also be able to return to \u201c normal \u201d activities ?\nNumerous scientists have found that there is a decreased risk of re-infection and extremely low rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection .\nThe range of reduction of re-infection from COVID-19 was between 82 % to 95 % among six studies that encompassed nearly 1 million people conducted in the U.S. , the U.K. , Denmark , Austria , Qatar , and among U.S. Marines .\nThe study in Austria also found that the frequency of re-infection from COVID-19 caused hospitalization in only five out of 14,840 ( 0.03 % ) people and death in one out of 14,840 ( 0.01 % ) .\nIn addition , newer U.S. data , released after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting up to 10 months following infection .\nAs public health policymakers reduce the discussion of immunity to vaccination status , largely ignored are the complexities of the human immune system .\nThere are multiple highly encouraging research reports showing that blood cells in our body , so called \u201c B cells and T cells , \u201d contribute to the cellular immunity after COVID-19 .\nIf SARS-CoV-2 immunity is similar to other severe coronavirus infections like SARS-CoV-1 immunity , that protection could last at least 17 years .\nHowever , tests to measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making them hard to get and preventing their use in routine medical practice or in public health surveys of the population .\nThe FDA has authorized numerous antibody tests .\nAs with any test , they require financial costs and time to obtain results , and there are important differences in the performance of each test in terms of what the positive antibodies actually represent .\nA critical distinction is that some tests only detect antibodies found after natural infection , \u201c N \u201d antibodies , and some can not differentiate between natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibodies .\nDoctors and patients should beware of this and ask which antibodies the tests actually measure .\nLast week , on May 19 , the FDA issued a public safety communication stating that while SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests play an important role in identifying people who have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and may have developed an adaptive immune response , antibody tests should not be used to determine immunity or protection against COVID-19 .\nHuh ?\nWhile it is important to note that message , it is confusing .\nThe FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left those alerted uncertain about why antibody testing should not be used to determine immunity or protection against COVID-19 .\nThe FDA statement went on to say that antibody tests should be used by those experienced with antibody testing .\nNot helpful\u2026 PLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA

Democracy ( NED ) \u2013 headed since its inception in 1983 by Carl Gershman \u2013 now has a new president and CEO \u2013 Damon Wilson .\nThe NED \u2019 s own announcement regarding the handover provides some background for Wilson , claiming : Mr. Wilson currently serves as Executive Vice President of the Atlantic Council , a role he has held since 2011 , overseeing Council strategy and managing its 14 centers and programs .\nEarlier , Wilson served as Special Assistant to the President and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Security Council ( 2007-2009 ) .\nHe was Executive Secretary and Chief of Staff at the US Embassy in Baghdad ( 2006-2007 ) , where he helped manage one of the largest US embassies during a time of conflict .\nPrior to this posting , he worked at the National Security Council as the Director for Central , Wilson \u2019 s previous employment \u2013 unlike Gershman who at least on paper came from a \u201c humanitarian \u201d background \u2013 reveals an unapologetic

.\nUnderstanding Wilson \u2019 s career of promoting American belligerence abroad will help one better understand which direction the US NED will take in its continued role in funding US-backed opposition groups and the regime change operations they are tasked with carrying out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s inception in 1983 \u2013 according to the Western media itself \u2013 was to rehabilitate the image of what was at the time CIA-sponsored regime change operations .\nThe Washington Post in a 1991 article titled , \u201c Innocence Abroad : The New World of Spyless Coups , \u201d would admit : Working in broad daylight , the United States and its allies were able to do things that would have been unthinkably dangerous had they been done in the shadows .\nRegarding the NED specifically , the Washington Post would note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the National Endowment for Democracy , a quasi-private group headed by Carl Gershman that is funded by the U.S. Congress .\nThrough the late 1980s , it did openly what had once been unspeakably covert \u2014 dispensing money to anti-communist forces behind the Iron Curtain .\nIn other words , the NED was a rebranding effort meant to dress up dirty and destructive US regime change campaigns as \u201c promoting freedom around the world \u201d \u2013 just as the NED \u2019 s slogan says on its official website .\nIt always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first announced to today \u2013 a velvet glove placed over the iron fist of covert US interventionism .\nAnd under Gershman for the last almost 40 years \u2013 that is what the NED served as .\nA \u201c presentable \u201d facade constructed over otherwise invasive , dirty , and destructive regime change campaigns \u2013 as invasive , dirty , and destructive as anything the CIA had carried out beforehand \u2013 but sold to the public as \u201c democracy promotion.\n\u201d Over the years , as the NED and parallel organizations , institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the once \u201c transparent \u201d nature of their work has been increasingly covered up , with key opposition groups receiving NED money removed from public disclosures on the NED \u2019 s website , and the NED becoming increasingly covert \u2013 defeating the entire purpose of its creation and existing simply as a redundant extension of the CIA itself .\nWith Wilson \u2019 s appointment as president and CEO of the NED \u2013 the velvet glove is coming off altogether .\nIn a 2018 Atlantic Council talk titled , \u201c Frontlines of Freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goal of US policymakers and their involvement in both the EU and NATO is not only to move both organizations up to Russia \u2019 s borders , but to absorb Russia itself \u2013 a policy that couldn \u2019 t be more obvious to geopolitical observers and the clear driving force behind Western-Russian tensions today .\nThroughout his time at the Atlantic Council he has helped promote US State Department narratives regarding not only the EU and NATO \u2019 s antagonism toward Russia , but the West \u2019 s wars abroad in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East .\nIn 2016 at the US Embassy in Berlin , he would advocate continued sanctions on Syria as well as continued support for armed militants the US is sponsoring to fight Syria \u2019 s government by proxy .\nWilson also participated directly in war propaganda projects with other notorious appendages of the Atlantic Council .\nThis includes a co-authored paper he wrote with US government-funded \u201c Bellingcat \u201d founder Eliot Higgins titled , \u201c Hiding in plain sight : Putin \u2019 s war in Ukraine.\n\u201d Together with Wilson as president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NED \u2019 s board of directors \u2013 are people like convicted criminal Elliott Abrams who oversaw death squads in Central and South America , Scott Carpenter who directly participated in the US occupation of Iraq as \u201c director of governance for the Coalition Provisional Authority , \u201d and Victoria Nuland whose conversations regarding the US hand-picking Ukraine \u2019 s new government in the wake of the US-sponsored 2014 coup was leaked to the media .\nThe NED \u2019 s role in promoting US-backed regime change under the paper-thin veneer of \u201c promoting freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a much more direct tool of aggression wielded by the US alongside sanctions and the ever-looming threat of military aggression .\nAnd while the US may believe Wilson \u2019 s appointment as president and CEO of the NED signals \u201c strength , \u201d in reality it is a sign of America \u2019 s growing weakness in combination with an increasingly aware global public \u2013 a global public that understands what the NED is , what it does , and the danger it poses \u2013 no matter what it claims to represent or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s appointment as president and CEO of the NED may help governments around the globe better explain to their respective populations the danger the NED poses and the necessity of legislation to inhibit or entirely ban the organization and those taking money from them from within their borders .\nGershman \u2013 for nearly 40 years \u2013 oversaw an NED attempting and ultimately failing to put a velvet glove over CIA-sponsored regime change .\nWilson will be overseeing an NED unable to hide behind such facades any longer \u2013 with his own pro-war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization

"21stcenturywire", "title": "Pharma\u2019s Statistical Trick to Coax Children Into Receiving Experimental Jabs", "content": "Many scientists and medical experts have warned that vaccinating children against COVID-19 is both unnecessary and risky in the extreme .\nThe video above features comments by Peter Doshi , Ph.D. , made during a June 10 , 2021 , public hearing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2019 s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee .\nDoshi is an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy and the senior editor of The BMJ .\nHe has previously pointed out that while Pfizer claims its vaccine is 95 % effective , this is the relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 which is far more relevant for public health measures \u2014 is actually less than 1 % .1 As such , the COVID-19 vaccine is of dubious benefit , to say the least .\nIf you choose to watch the video above I must warn you to stop after Doshi finishes and not view the presentation by Dr. Jacqueline Miller .\nShe \u2019 s a paid shill pediatrician and the head of development for infectious diseases at Moderna .\nThe reason I advise this caution is because if you understand reality , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician can sell out and sacrifice even her own children in the delusional belief that Moderna \u2019 s shot provides any benefit to children .\nMeanwhile , largely because of irresponsible beliefs and comments like Miller \u2019 s , harms are rapidly mounting , which skews the risk-benefit ratio even further .\nConsidering the potential for harm , children should not get the COVID-19 vaccine , Doshi says , citing trial evidence from Pfizer \u2014 the very same evidence used to support its emergency use authorization application for 12- to 15-year-olds .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits .\n[ GRAPHIC IMAGE : For the last 9 months , the pharmaceutical industry , along with their partners in government and a compliant media , have all gone to great lengths to promote the misconception that their products are totally \u201c safe , \u201d and somehow \u201c 95 % effective \u201d against supposed \u2018 cases \u2019 and \u2018 diseases \u2019 present in their test groups .\nUpon closer analysis , their widely repeated claims quickly unravel . ]\nWhile benefits were rare and short-lived , side effects were common and long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12-to-15 age group , 75.5 % experienced headache , along with a long list of other transient side effects .\nHowever , more serious systemic adverse events also occurred in 2.4 % of the trial subjects receiving the actual mRNA shot .\nNow , Pfizer boasted a 100 % efficacy rate in this age group .\nThis , Doshi explains , was based on 16 cases occurring in the placebo group , while no cases were recorded in the vaccine group .\nHowever , since there were about 1,000 placebo recipients , fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually tested positive for COVID-19 .\nOne of the reasons for why children reap so little benefit from this jab is because a significant portion of American children are already immune and aren \u2019 t at risk of infection to begin with .\nDoshi cites Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showing an estimated 23 % of children under the age of 4 and 42 % of those age 5 through 17 have already had a SARS-CoV-2 infection and now have robust and long-lasting immunity .\nWhile most side effects in children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths among 12- to 17-year-olds had been reported as of June 11 , 2021 , as well as 271 events rated \u201c serious.\n\u201d 2 In the long term , there \u2019 s really no telling what might happen , and that \u2019 s a really important point .\nAs noted by Doshi , during the 2009 swine flu pandemic , narcolepsy didn \u2019 t become apparent until nine months after vaccination with the Pandemrix vaccine , and it wasn \u2019 t until four months into Israel \u2019 s COVID-19 vaccination campaign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect in young men and boys .\nDoshi goes on to explain why vaccinating children will not likely benefit adults , as claimed .\nThis practice , sometimes referred to as \u201c cocooning , \u201d has never actually been proven .\nDoshi cites a 2021 BMJ editorial3 in which the authors stressed that vaccinating children against COVID-19 is \u201c hard to justify right now , \u201d seeing how children experience only mild disease and transmission by children is limited , while the possibility of unintended consequences is high .\nDoshi points out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit is better than nothing , you must remember that this is an unproven hypothetical benefit .\nWe would need a proper randomized controlled trial to ascertain whether vaccinating children might actually benefit adults .\n\u201c We need confirmatory evidence , not just assumptions , \u201d Doshi says .\nHowever , even if vaccinating children were found to reduce infection among adults , we may still not be able to do so .\nWhy ?\nBecause the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can only authorize the use of a medical product in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk in that same population .\nThis means that even if adults were to benefit , if children don \u2019 t benefit from it themselves , then we can not authorize the vaccine for children .\nSo , if children reap no benefit , then whether or not vaccinating them might benefit adults is a moot argument .\nYou can not authorize a drug for use in a population that reaps no benefit .\nIn conclusion , Doshi points out that the FDA has no basis on which to grant COVID-19 vaccines emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , as COVID-19 is not an emergency in children .\nThe threat this infection poses to children is negligible and no more serious than that of the common cold or flu .\nSince demonstrated risks far outweigh demonstrated benefits in children , the vaccines also fail to meet the biologics license application required for ultimate market approval .\nAlready , healthy children have died shortly after the jabs , dozens of cases of heart inflammation have been reported , and Pfizer \u2019 s own biodistribution study raises serious questions about the shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last but not least , since there \u2019 s no \u201c unmet need , \u201d there \u2019 s also no need to rush to approve these injections for children .\nTo be clear , the only way they can even try to justify vaccinating children is by sacrificing them as shields to protect the elderly , which is completely unethical .\nChildren are not harmed by COVID-19 itself , yet they keep using the slogan that \u201c Nobody is safe until everyone is vaccinated , \u201d which simply isn \u2019 t true .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects are unknown , there \u2019 s reason to suspect they may be severe .\nA Pfizer biodistribution study5,6 demonstrates the synthetic mRNA does not stay near the injection site as initially assumed .\nIt is , in fact , widely disseminated in your body within hours of injection .\nIt enters your bloodstream and accumulates in a variety of organs , primarily your spleen , bone marrow , liver , adrenal glands and , in women , the ovaries .\nThe spike protein \u2014 which we now know is pathogenic and causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel to your heart , brain and lungs .\nOnce in your blood circulation , the spike protein binds to platelet receptors and the cells that line your blood vessels .\nWhen that happens , one of several things can occur : \u2022 It can cause platelets to clump together \u2014 Platelets , aka thrombocytes , are specialized cells in your blood that stop bleeding .\nWhen there \u2019 s blood vessel damage , they clump together to form a blood clot .\nThis is why we \u2019 ve been seeing clotting disorders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 It can cause abnormal bleeding \u2022 In your heart , it can cause heart problems \u2022 In your brain , it can cause neurological damage \u2022 In your blood vessels , it can cause vasculitis , including Kawasaki disease , antiphospholipid syndrome , rheumatoid arthritis , scleroderma and Sjogren \u2019 s disease .\nThese conditions significantly increase your risk of death , in some cases raising mortality by 50 times compared to people who do not have these conditions Regardless of the tissue , the spike protein can also impair your mitochondrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , innate immunity and disease prevention of all kinds .\nWhen the spike protein interacts with the ACE2 receptor , it can disrupt mitochondrial signaling , thereby inducing the production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress .\nIf the damage is serious enough , uncontrolled cell death can occur , which in turn leaks mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) into your bloodstream.8 Aside from being detected in cases involving acute tissue injury , heart attack and sepsis , freely circulating mtDNA has also been shown to contribute to a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndrome or SIRS , heart disease , liver failure , HIV infection , rheumatoid arthritis and certain cancers.9 The spike protein is also expelled in breast milk , which could be lethal for babies .\nYou are not transferring antibodies .\nYou are transferring the vaccine itself , as well as the spike protein , which could result in bleeding and/or blood clots in your child .\nAll of this suggests that for individuals who are at low risk for COVID-19 , children and teens in particular , the risks of these vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI \u2019 ve written several articles detailing the mechanisms by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can decimate your health .\nFor a refresher , see my interview with Stephanie Seneff , Ph.D. , and Judy Mikovits , Ph.D. , featured in \u201c The Many Ways in Which COVID Vaccines May Harm Your Health.\n\u201d I recently came across yet another paper that describes a very important mechanism that , to my knowledge , is not widely known , despite being published in July 2020 .\nThe paper , \u201c Genetic Polymorphisms Complicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cytokine Storm , \u201d 10 explains that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a far higher affinity for porphyrin molecules in the cell membrane than ACE-2 .\nPorphyrins are molecules with optical properties .\nTheir ability to absorb light accounts for many of the beneficial health effects of sunlight.11 Porphyrins are also the building blocks of heme , the precursor to hemoglobin , which is necessary to bind oxygen in your blood .\nAccording to this paper , porphyrins not only facilitate SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the cell , but they also allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell , thereby increasing oxidative stress .\nWhen the spike protein bind to porphyrins , it upregulates free heme and iron , which causes oxidation and fuels inflammation .\nIt also increases reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) formation , while decreasing levels of heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1 ) enzymes .\nHO enzymes degrade heme into free iron , bilirubin ( which has antioxidant effects ) and carbon monoxide ( which is antiapoptotic ) .\nAs such , the HO system plays a crucial role in cellular defense .\nThe spike protein essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HO-1 .\nAs dysfunctional porphyrin are no longer capable of making heme , more hemoprotein becomes available for SARS-CoV-2 to bind to , which results in the release of more free iron .\nAs the cycle continues , inflammation builds .\nIron released by dying cells also has toxic effects .\nAll of this has devastating consequences for your mitochondria , and , as noted in this paper:12 This explains why obese individuals are at much higher risk .\nBecause their fat cells have fewer mitochondria , they \u2019 re less able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with higher levels of inflammation .\nThe unprecedented outpouring of toxic iron into the body may also help explain why some end up with \u201c long-hauler syndrome \u201d after recovering from COVID-19 .\nWorst of all , since all of this is related to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein , the COVID shots may also end up promoting cancer , as excess iron is tightly associated with tumorigenesis in multiple human cancer types through a variety of mechanisms , including catalyzing the formation of mutagenic hydroxyl radicals , regulating DNA replication , repair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cancer cells , and acting as an essential nutrient for proliferating tumor cells .\nDo You Have Vaccine Regret ?\nIf you \u2019 ve already had one or two COVID shots and are now having second thoughts , first , be sure to never have another vaccination again , with any vaccine of any kind .\nEven if you \u2019 re not having discernible symptoms as of yet , you \u2019 d be wise to start building your innate immune system .\nTo do that , you need to become metabolically flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Vladimir Zelenko June 23 , 2021 , and that interview should go live July 4 , 2021 .\nWe discussed what Dr. Mike Yeadon \u2014 a former chief scientist at Pfizer , which is one of the primary manufacturers of COVID shots \u2014 believes , which is that those who are vaccinated are already condemned to certain and agonizing deaths .\nHe believes those who have received the injection will die prematurely and three years is a generous estimate for how long they can expect to remain alive .\nIf Yeadon \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVERYTHING .\nThere is no way to know if it is accurate or not , but Yeadon is someone who has serious insights as Pfizer \u2019 s former chief scientist .\nI was a Boy Scout and their motto is to \u201c Be prepared.\n\u201d Clearly , this is one contingency that needs to be planned for .\nZelenko happens to share this belief .\nWe discuss in great detail the strategies that can be used to lower the risk of Yeadon \u2019 s predictions coming true .\nUse time-restricted eating and eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a six- to eight-hour window .\nAvoid all vegetable oils and processed foods .\nFocus on certified-organic foods to minimize your glyphosate exposure , and include plenty of sulfur-rich foods to keep your mitochondria and lysosomes healthy .\nBoth are important for the clearing of cellular debris , including these spike proteins .\nYou can also boost your sulfate by taking Epsom salt baths .\nYou \u2019 ll also want to make sure your vitamin D level is optimized to between 60 ng/mL and 80 ng/mL ( 100 nmol/L to 150 nmol/L ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunlight also has other benefits besides making vitamin D. To combat the toxicity of the spike protein , you \u2019 ll want to optimize autophagy , which may help digest and remove the spike proteins .\nTime-restricted eating will upregulate autophagy , while sauna therapy , which upregulates heat shock proteins , will help refold misfolded proteins and also tag damaged proteins and target them for removal .\nIt is important that your sauna is hot enough ( around 170 degrees Fahrenheit ) and does not have high magnetic or electric fields .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re experiencing side effects from your COVID shot ( s ) include : .\nThis article is

\u2018Airstrike Diplomacy\u2019 Continues in Syria and Iraq", "content": "On June 27 , 2021 the US carried out additional strikes against targets along the Syrian-Iraqi border .\nThe attacks were condemned by both the Syrian and Iraqi governments and represent not only a dangerous escalation by American military aggression in the region , but the continuation of US aggression in the Middle East spanning two decades regardless of who occupies the White House or Congress .\nA US Department of Defense statement dated June 27 , 2021 regarding the US strikes would claim : At President Biden \u2019 s direction , U.S. military forces earlier this evening conducted defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militia groups in the Iraq-Syria border region .\nhe targets were selected because these facilities are utilized by Iran-backed militias that are engaged in unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) attacks against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq .\nThe statement would also claim : We are in Iraq at the invitation of the Government of Iraq for the sole purpose of assisting the Iraqi Security Forces in their efforts to defeat ISIS .\nAs a matter of international law , the United States acted pursuant to its right of self-defense .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat and appropriately limited in scope .\nAs a matter of domestic law , the President took this action pursuant to his Article II authority to protect U.S. personnel in Iraq .\nWhile \u201c assisting Iraqi Security Forces in their efforts to defeat ISIS \u201d is the official excuse for US forces remaining in Iraq \u2013 the truth is that US forces have occupied Iraq illegally since the US-led invasion in 2003 which was deemed very much illegal by the UN .\nA 2004 Guardian article titled , Iraq war was illegal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d would note : And despite claims that the US is in Iraq \u201c at the invitation of the Government of Iraq \u201d in a bid to justify its military aggression , the government of Iraq itself has unequivocally condemned the US strikes as a violation of the nation \u2019 s sovereignty .\nThe New York Times in a June 28 , 2021 article titled , \u201c Iraq Condemns U.S. Airstrikes on Iran-Backed Militias , \u201d would report : The New York Times also notes that the militias targeted by the US and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c on the [ Iraqi ] government payroll.\n\u201d Not mentioned by the New York Times is that these militias played a key role in the defeat of the self-proclaimed \u201c Islamic State \u201d ( ISIS ) in both Iraq and neighboring Syria .\nThe New York Times mentions the US assassination of General Qassim Suleimani , commander of Iran \u2019 s Quds Force , which \u2013 under General Suleimani \u2019 s leadership \u2013 also played a key role in the defeat of ISIS in both Syria and Iraq .\nGeneral Suleimani was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iraqi government when the US carried out air strikes to assassinate the Iranian military commander .\nWashington \u2019 s claims of maintaining its military occupation of Iraq to \u201c assist \u201d in defeating ISIS is contradicted by its campaign of violence against Iraq \u2019 s Iranian allies who are likewise assisting in the defeat of extremist forces \u2013 not only in Iraq \u2013 but also in neighboring Syria .\nUnlike the US , however , Iran is not allied with ISIS \u2019 key state sponsors .\nIn 2016 , then US Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e-mail would mention key US allies \u2013 Saudi Arabia and Qatar \u2013 by name as providing \u201c clandestine financial and logistical support \u201d to ISIS and \u201c other radical Sunni groups in the region.\n\u201d Of course , the US itself was also funding , arming , training , and otherwise equipping extremist groups fighting alongside Al Qaeda and ISIS .\nAn August 2017 New York Times article titled , \u201c Behind the Sudden Death of a $ 1 Billion Secret C.I.A .\nWar in Syria , \u201d would mention reports that : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the hands of a rebel group tied to Al Qaeda further sapped political support for the program .\nThe same article would claim that extremist organizations affiliated with Al Qaeda \u201c often fought alongside the C.I.A.-backed rebels \u201d and admitted that by the end of the US program these extremist organizations dominated the so-called opposition in Syria .\nHad the US been genuinely funding , arming , training , and otherwise equipping moderate rebels to the tune of billions of dollars , who was funding , arming , training , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to eventually displace US-backed rebels on Syria \u2019 s battlefields ?\nThe answer is that there never were any moderate rebels to begin with .\nThe US set out arming extremist forces deliberately as part of its proxy war against Damascus .\nAs early as 2007 , journalists like Seymour Hersh in his article , \u201c The Redirection : Is the Administration \u2019 s new policy benefitting our enemies in the war on terrorism ?\n, \u201d would expose Washington \u2019 s preparations to do exactly that , warning ( emphasis added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only did the United States give rise to Al Qaeda and ISIS across the region and specifically in Syria and Iraq , it did so deliberately .\nIt is using the threat of extremism it and its regional allies sponsored to begin with as a pretext to remain in the region militarily and as a smokescreen behind which it is carrying out an escalating campaign of aggression against Iraq and Syria \u2019 s allies who actually aided in Al Qaeda and ISIS \u2019 defeat .\nThe US attempts to cite international and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depict its ongoing aggression as \u201c self-defense \u201d regarding US forces stationed thousands of miles from American shores and who are in the Middle East as a direct result of an illegal war of aggression predicated two decades ago on deliberately fabricated accusations of \u201c weapons of mass destruction \u201d Washington claimed the Iraqi government possessed at the time

element of propaganda : \u201c we now have two Americas ; the states with high rates of vaccination and those with low rates ; this divide is intolerable ; we can \u2019 t allow it.\n\u201d Why not ?\nIf millions of ignorant people insist on taking the destructive injection , and a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states with vastly different vaccination policies and rates , then people have a choice .\nLive in state A or B .\nBut choice is not what the establishment wants .\nTHAT \u2019 s why they whine and moan and warn about two Americas .\nAnd from the beginning of the op , they knew there would be states with very different vaccination rates\u2014and they knew they would be warning against it .\nBut wait .\nThere \u2019 s more .\nThe propaganda describes people/areas where the vaccination rates are low as : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color.\n\u201d All along , the planning involved special targeting of these groups .\nDemonizing the \u201c uneducated Republicans , \u201d and

succumbed to pressure by the media and medical industrial complex , as they reverse course on policy of allowing spectators to watch the Olympic events .\nGovernment advisors claim that Delta Variant ( formerly known as the Indian Variant ) \u2018 cases \u2019 are on the move , unleashing a new wave of official hysteria .\nThis latest \u2018 state of emergency \u2019 scare is a direct result of an increase in PCR testing and computer-modeled predictions about the \u2018 possible spread \u2019 of an alleged \u2018 Delta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surging through the Tokyo metropolitan area .\nThe

enough , \u201d claiming that the Games are not \u2018 safe \u2019 for fans .\nCurrently , Japan has only vaccinated 20 % of its population , but the media and global \u2018 public health \u2019 experts believe this is not enough and are pressuring the government to push the experimental gene-jab on more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back \u2019 the illusive Delta Variant .\nTOKYO \u2014 Japan will bar spectators from all Olympic events held in and around Tokyo , organizers announced on Thursday , as the government imposed a fresh state of emergency to cover the capital during the Games .\nPrime

she said .\nOlympic organizers , working closely with the government , had announced two weeks ago that they would allow some domestic spectators to attend events .\nThey capped attendance at 10,000 or 50 percent of a venue \u2019 s capacity , but warned at the time they might change course if infections rose again .\nThe government \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing even limited numbers of fans would raise risks of increased rates of coronavirus infections .\nPublic opposition to proceeding with the Games had waned in recent weeks , but most people still believed the Games should be canceled

"China\u2019s Rise: From Humiliated Colony to Global Power", "content": "As China celebrated 100 years of the ruling Communist Party of China ( CPC ) it was also celebrating the nation \u2019 s rise from a humiliated colony subjugated by Western imperialism to a global power .\nIn just the last 21 years of the 21st century , China has transformed from a developing nation , to rivalling the United States , to now being poised to surpass the US and the West in general .\nChina \u2019 s rise has also meant the rise of Asia and beyond as it builds an alternative to the so-called \u201c rules-based international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US and its Western allies .\nChinese President Xii Jinping \u2019 s speech commemorating the 100 year anniversary of the CPC was devoid of self-proclaimed \u201c global leadership \u201d and instead focused on strengthening China internally while constructively contributing to the world abroad , mentioning its massive infrastructure building spree \u2013 the One Belt , One Road \u2013 by name .\nPresident Xi Jinping also noted China \u2019 s transformation from , \u201c a highly centralized planned economy to a socialist market economy.\n\u201d Indeed , China today is not the China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 100 years ago , though the Western media has worked hard to convince global audiences otherwise \u2013 attempting to reinforce not only the most negative prejudices held toward China , but also the most inaccurate ones .\nPresident Xi Jinping \u2019 s speech and related activities to the 100 year anniversary of the CPC covered a wide range of topics .\nCelebrations and performances noted China \u2019 s progress in everything from manufacturing , energy production , and infrastructure , to space exploration , poverty reduction , and the development of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China has accomplished for its 1.4 billion citizens as well as for its friends and allies abroad feats in the realm of development , peace , and stability unrivalled by the West .\nYet Western media coverage appeared fixated on a single sentence taken from an over 5,000 word speech .\nThe BBC in its article , \u201c CCP 100 : Xi warns China will not be \u2018 oppressed \u2019 in anniversary speech , \u201d would begin by stating : China \u2019 s President Xi Jinping has warned that foreign powers will \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to bully or influence the country .\nThe quote was meant to provoke Western audiences , many of whom are guided by their respective media outlets of choice to adopt a sense of superiority and to feel threatened by China \u2019 s successes .\nIt was also meant to couple with a massive disinformation campaign depicting China as a threat to global peace and stability , leading audiences to see the quote as threatening to \u201c bash \u201d the heads of anyone who now tries to hold China accountable .\nDeliberately omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to President Xi Jinping \u2019 s or China \u2019 s well-founded concerns regarding foreign powers who at one point in China \u2019 s recent history , colonized sections of its territory with Hong Kong being handed back over to China by the British only as recently as 1997 and with Taiwan still maintained as a Western foothold in Chinese territory to this day .\nIn fact , the only mention of Hong Kong and Taiwan by the BBC related to claims of Beijing \u2019 s \u201c crackdown \u201d on Hong Kong and tensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China \u2013 two points of contention created deliberately by the West as a means to pressure Beijing and to contain the rise of China .\nChina \u2019 s humiliation by the West lasted nearly a century and in many ways still continues \u2013 albeit in an ever diminishing capacity .\nThe arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in 2018 by Canadian police at the direction of the US government over alleged violations of illegal US sanctions against Iran serves as a pertinent example of this continued campaign by the West to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to humiliate it and its people at every juncture .\nThe BBC in its article also claimed that China \u201c has repeatedly accused the US of trying to curb its growth , \u201d as if to suggest Beijing is imagining this rather than it being a central theme of US foreign policy toward China and Asia in general .\nUS documents such as the declassified \u201c U.S .\nStrategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific , \u201d released as part of the Trump White House archives , explicitly state that US objectives in Asia include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indo-Pacific region , \u201d and to \u201c promote a liberal economic order while preventing China from establishing new , illiberal spheres of influence.\n\u201d In reality , US President Donald Trump \u2019 s desire to maintain primacy over Asia ( including China ) was carried over from the Obama Administration \u2013 who in turn was pursuing an agenda that has been ongoing for decades \u2013 articulated as early as the 1960 \u2019 s in the \u201c Pentagon Papers.\n\u201d And it is a policy that continues today .\nCurrent US President Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s place in the world , \u201d would claim that \u201c American leadership \u201d must meet \u201c advancing authoritarianism , including the growing ambitions of China to rival the United States.\n\u201d How else would either Trump \u2019 s or Biden \u2019 s stated objectives be met besides \u201c curbing China \u2019 s growth ?\n\u201d And that is exactly what US sanctions , kidnapping industry leaders , destabilizing Chinese allies , and its growing propaganda war against China itself all aim to achieve \u2013 curbing China \u2019 s growth .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find themselves not only being surpassed by China , but engaged in a campaign of geopolitical bullying with a nation increasingly able to fight back .\nChina understands that \u201c the West \u201d is not merely Wall Street , Washington , London , and Brussels .\nIt is a region including hundreds of millions of people who otherwise could be potential partners in building a new multipolar world order where national sovereignty \u2013 not a self-appointed international arbiter composed of elite special interests \u2013 holds primacy .\nToward that end , China has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the reach of these fading special interests is inevitable .\nChina has a population 4-5 times larger than the US .\nIt \u2019 s population is hardworking and well-educated .\nChina produces millions more graduates in the fields of science , technology , engineering , and mathematics than the US does \u2013 every year .\nThese are graduates that will directly contribute to research and development , technological innovation , improved manufacturing and the overall expansion of China \u2019 s already massive industrial capacity , as well as the construction of essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the OBOR initiative .\nChina is already counted by the nations of Asia as a leading trade partner and investor .\nEven nations like Australia and New Zealand find themselves pivoting eastward , placing economic development ahead of traditional political alliances .\nAustralia \u2019 s leadership is attempting to ignore the changing tides of geopolitics and has thus self-inflicted economic hardship on its population .\nNew Zealand has performed a much more graceful balancing act to its own benefit while setting a precedent for others to follow , including for Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already larger than the United States \u2019 \u2013 with the rest of its armed forces more than capable of defending against any Western aggression against it in its own territory .\nAnd while the Western media continues to cite the threat of China using military force to \u201c take \u201d Taiwan , Taiwan has \u2013 like nations in the region \u2013 found itself tied economically to the mainland \u2019 s rise .\nTaiwan is additionally a territory of China and the people of Taiwan share a common fate with the mainland .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ propels Taiwan \u2019 s economy , not trade with the West .\nThis is a trend that will only continue well into the foreseeable future .\nLooking at these fundamentals , what can the US and its partners do to \u201c maintain primacy \u201d over the \u201c Indo-Pacific region \u201d and by implication over China ?\nWhile the US attempts to use sanctions , political subversion \u2013 both within and along China \u2019 s borders \u2013 and even military aggression by proxy or directly \u2013 US leadership appears not to have considered whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a nation with a larger population and soon to have a larger economy was ever sound to begin with .\nThe story of China \u2019 s rise will not only be about how it went an impoverished , humiliated colony of Western powers to a global superpower , and perhaps even the premier global superpower \u2013 but also a story about how it has and will continue to navigate the dangerous , irrational policies of the West in its increasingly desperate bid to contain this rise .\nIt will also be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West \u2019 s mistaken pursuit of unsustainable hegemony once its rise is

Coleman: \u2018The MHRA \u2013 Nothing Changes\u2019", "content": "I have previously expressed concern about the fact that the MHRA ( the powerful medicines regulatory agency in the UK ) has received \u00a3980,000 from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 which has a major interest in vaccine manufacture .\nThose concerned about the integrity of the MHRA will be interested in the following paragraphs taken from my book Coleman \u2019 s Laws .\n` High street shoppers are now encouraged to purchase cholesterol lowering drugs even though ( as I first revealed in my book How to Stop Your Doctor Killing You in 1996 ) there is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both safe and necessary .\nYour friendly local pharmacist will sell you a test to find out if you have too much cholesterol and then , if you have , sell you just the drug to deal with it .\nIn April 2005 , the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin revealed that the British Government had re-classified the cholesterol lowering drug Simvastatin as an over-the-counter product , called Zocor Heart-Pro , available to be purchased without a prescription , although this decision was \u2018 not based on robust evidence of clinical benefit .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had uncovered evidence that the medicines regulator ( the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \u2014 MHRA ) had inaccurately reported the consultation which preceded the re-classification .\nIn November 2003 , the MHRA had published a consultation document on the proposed re-classification of this drug .\nOne hundred responses were received from a wide range of professional organisations , patient groups and individuals .\nThe MHRA announced that about two thirds of respondents were in favour of the proposal .\nNot true , according to the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the MHRA has made available for public scrutiny indicates that 31 % of these respondents offered at least some support for the re-classification , 35 % clearly opposed it and the rest offered no clear opinion either way\u2026Even if all 20 of the withheld responses are assumed to have been in favour of the re-classification , only 45 % of all respondents at most could be described as supporting the proposal .\nSo , to put it politely , the MHRA had bent the truth .\nWhy would it do this ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money when a drug is made available without prescription .\nThey can sell their product to far more people and don \u2019 t have to worry about persuading doctors to prescribe it .\nSecond , the Government saves money because all the patients who take the drug have to pay for it themselves .\nIn the UK , around 1.8 million people were taking statins when the drug was first made available without a prescription .\nThe cost to the NHS was \u00a3700 million and rising fast .\nWith drug company campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving extremely effective it was estimated that the NHS bill would exceed \u00a32 billion a year within a few years .\nThirdly , many of the people associated with the MHRA are alleged to have long-standing links with the drug industry .\nSome own shares in drug companies .\nI have been writing about such matters since 1970 and so I wasn \u2019 t in the slightest bit surprised to hear that once again a Government agency had acted in a way designed to benefit a drug company and to put ordinary citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulletin reported that no trials had assessed the drug \u2019 s long-term effectiveness in its target group \u2014 people likely to be at moderate risk of having a heart attack .\n\u2018 The lack of such research , \u2019 said the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin , \u2018 raises serious questions about whether people are unknowingly wasting their money \u2014 around \u00a3170 a year \u2014 on a treatment that might not work .\nAlso , crucially , since people can be sold Zocor Heart-Pro without a detailed assessment that includes measurement of blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongly classed and treated as being at only moderate risk of a heart attack , when in reality their risk is very much higher.\n\u2019 Consumers finding a drug freely available without prescription would , of course , not be aware of the nature and extent of the problems associated with drugs of this type .\nWhen NASA astronaut Dr Duane Graveline had a heart attack he was given a statin to reduce the risk of a recurrence .\nSix weeks after starting the drug he lost some of his memory for six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did not recognise either his wife or his own home .\nOn recovering , Dr Graveline took himself off the drug but , a year later , decided to try it again .\nHe had another attack of what is known as \u2018 transient global amnesia \u2019 ( TGA ) which wiped out every memory since early childhood .\nThis attack lasted twelve hours .\nThere are hundreds of examples of statins causing TGA .\nQuite apart from the fears and anxieties these attacks produce it is scary to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus driver had one of these attacks .\nAmnesia isn \u2019 t the only problem linked to these drugs .\nOne study found a 25 % increase in newly diagnosed cancer among older people after four years treatment with a statin .\nThe cancers which seem most likely to develop include cancer of the breast and cancer of the gastrointestinal tract .", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

blood clotting has been linked to more deaths than COVID-19 in Australia in 2021 .\nAustralia \u2019 s top medical official has urged countrymen who received an AstraZeneca vaccine to \u201c not delay

GRAPH : As of July 5th , only one death from COVID in 2021 ( Source : Worldometer ) These statistics beg the ultimate question : Does the risk of the virus \u201c far outweigh \u201d jab side effects ?\nWell , this depends on understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOf course , the low coronavirus death count in Australia will be attributed to mask wearing , social distancing , snap lockdowns and other \u2018 COVID Safe \u2019 measures .\nHowever , if there is currently an inferred 50 % higher chance of death ( 1:2 ) from COVID-19 because of rare vaccine complications , versus the safety of using existing measures , shouldn \u2019 t those who don \u2019 t want to be jabbed be given the choice between getting the dose OR continuing measures ?\nWhy the mass coercion if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not more \u2014 at prevention ?\nFurthermore , let \u2019 s even go off the mainstream narrative here : If it is claimed that vaccines don \u2019 t actually 100 % protect you from COVID ( rather shield you from \u2018 severe symptoms \u2019 ) , doesn \u2019 t this also infer guidelines are better in the long-term ?\nWhat is the point of vaccines if fully-vaccinated residents were still subject to recent lockdowns ?\nThe statistics show more people have died from the vaccine under the current circumstances .\nMeaning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to vaccine risks .\nAlthough it is rare to get a blood clot , the chance of dying from the virus when following precautions is even rarer .\nIt seems even Queensland \u2019 s Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young , agrees with this premise : In addition , if a deadly virus is on the loose , forever changing into new variants and dodging immunisation schedules in years to come , wouldn \u2019 t the safest bet be to shape the current direction ?\nCertain measures for the vulnerable , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns to normal ?\nShouldn \u2019 t this fact alone call for a change in existing safety measures ?\nLet \u2019 s not forget that coronavirus spikes are occurring in 80 % of the world \u2019 s most vaccinated countries , adding further weight that vaccines are not the way back to normality .\nThus , the notion that \u2018 lockdowns will end when we are all vaccinated \u2019 is fallible .\nLet \u2019 s focus on : \u2018 lockdowns will end when\u2026 \u2019 *insert a new approach without vaccines here* .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that need to be asked , but the media never raise them .\nI \u2019 m not a proponent of lockdown measures , but if this is a strong discussion point to raise with the average Australian in relation to the efficacy of the vaccine , I think it is important to note .\nOnce they figure out the vaccine isn \u2019 t the \u2018 way out \u2019 , or more broadly that there is no end to this new-age of perpetual warfare

Effective Treatments for COVID-19", "content": "Since COVID-19 hit the scene at the beginning of 2020 , one of the key elements driving the fear around this disease is that there appeared to be no cure .\nAnd , for people who got infected with COVID-19 , the guidance coming from major global institutions such as the NIH ( US National Institutes of Health ) and the CDC ( US Centres for Disease Control ) was basically \u201c do nothing , stay home , and when you turn blue go to the hospital.\n\u201d This public health policy prescription was usually followed by the qualifying caveat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a vaccine arrives.\n\u201d This , clearly , has terrified people all around the world .\nFor the majority of the world \u2019 s population the belief has been that catching COVID-19 is a veritable death sentence .\nWhich leads us to an important question .\nHow would things change if there were , in fact , effective treatments for COVID-19 ?\nI have just come out of a fascinating 90-minute press conference and Zoom call , delivered by the Malaysian Alliance for Effective COVID Control ( MAECC ) .\nThis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation .\nThe main message ?\nThere are very

sfnsn=mo The essence of the discussion in the MAECC session focused on the drug Ivermectin .\nThe Doctors found it necessary to do a press conference and public presentation because the widespread use of Ivermectin in Malaysia is currently illegal .\nA doctor prescribing Ivermectin for his COVID-19 patients was recently raided by police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge research here , but simply trying to care for their patients by working to get a proven treatment officially accepted for use in Malaysia .\nIvermectin has already been used very successfully in many places around the world where media hysteria did not get it banned from the shelves .\nMexico has used it to great effect , as did Peru .\nOver the last few weeks , reports coming out of India are demonstrating massive benefits from Ivermectin .\nThere is already a 97 % decline in cases in New Delhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian states that are using Ivermectin now report decreases in cases by 60 % to 95 % .\nHowever , other states that have blocked the use of Ivermectin have increases in cases by several hundred percent \u2013 the exponential explosion that everyone is terrified of !\nAs The Desert Review says in their report , \u201c It is a clear refutation of the WHO , FDA , NIH , and CDC \u2019 s policies of \u2018 wait at home until you turn blue \u2019 before you get treatment.\n\u201d Before you buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c observational studies \u201d and haven \u2019 t been tested by large scale , randomized control trials approved by the WHO , CDC , NIH , FDA etc .\nit \u2019 s important to realize that the only type of studies that are apparently good enough for such institutions these days are those which are so large and complex that only multi-national pharmaceutical companies are able to run and fund them .\nThat said , you should know that 56 studies on Ivermectin , 17 of them being Randomized Control Trials , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA site doing real-time meta-analysis of all the Ivermectin studies as they get published summarizes the results as follows : \u201c 100 % of the 17 Randomized Controlled Trials ( RCTs ) for early treatment and prophylaxis report positive effects , with an estimated improvement of 73 % and 83 % respectively \u201d .\nThey also make the point that \u201c The probability that an ineffective treatment generated results as positive as the 56 studies to date is estimated to be 1 in 2 trillion ( p = 0.00000000000041 ) .\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their site ( Source : https : //ivmmeta.com ) .\nAnother effective protocol for prophylaxis and early treatment of COVID-19 is Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) with Zinc .\nAs of this writing , 248 trials of HCQ used for treating COVID-19 have been completed , by 3,972 scientists , with 378,812 patients .\nWe can see 66 % improvement in 26 early treatment trials , 75 % improvement in 11 early treatment mortality results , and 24 % improvement in 35 randomized controlled trials .\nThese results are publicly available on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date .\nYou can see those studies here at https : //c19hcq.com .\nThere are also a number of other effective treatments for COVID-19 that we don \u2019 t have space for here .\nWhat \u2019 s important to understand is that these effective treatments have been used since mid-2020 .\nWhich raises a very important point .\nIf these treatments are so effective , why haven \u2019 t we heard about them ?\nWhy aren \u2019 t they being used everywhere ?\nIt appears that , for some reason , information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being suppressed .\nFor instance , \u201c Fact checkers \u201d will tell you that HCQ or Ivermectin aren \u2019 t authorized by major institutions like the FDA , CDC , or WHO ( as if such organizations are supposed to set and police policy rather than simply providing guidance ) .\nThey will also try to discount any positive results using ad hominem attacks and smears , such as pointing out that a person using one of these treatments may have at some time in the past , voiced \u201c anti-vaccine sentiments \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can see an example here : https : //factcheck.afp.com/ivermectin-and-hydroxychloroquine-are-not-proven-covid-19-treatments The censorship extends to Social Media .\nA whole list of front-line doctors who have successfully used some of these treatments have had their accounts removed from Social Media platforms , simply because information they provided about their successes was deemed \u201c contrary to guidelines from the WHO \u201d by the various Big Tech platforms .\nI have personally witnessed the de-platforming of literally dozens of highly respected , professional , front line doctors and researchers .\nDe-platforming is not the only concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discredit effective treatments for COVID-19 , anything goes .\nA study which came out in The Lancet mid-2020 supposedly showing that HCQ was dangerous was subsequently withdrawn due to the study being fraudulent .\nSadly , this withdrawal happened only after the damage was done , and HCQ had been successfully kicked to the curb in many places around the world \u2013 even up to the point that in some jurisdictions doctors could be jailed for prescribing it !\nYou may ask : \u201c How did these studies that were apparently designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used drug , pass peer review in the world \u2019 s premier medical science journals \u2013 The Lancet as well as The New England Journal of Medicine ?\n\u201d The details of this sordid tale can be found here : https : //ahrp.org/the-lancet-published-a-fraudulent-study-editor-calls-it-department-of-error/ If one digs , it appears that the main reason that we have not heard of these effective treatments is that the WHO and the CDC and other major institutions do not approve of the use of any alternative treatments , unless these are being tested in a clinical trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approve of ) .\nFor instance , the US National Institutes for Health ( NIH ) guidelines state : \u201c The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel ( the Panel ) recommends against the use of any drugs for SARS-CoV-2 pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , except in a clinical trial ( AIII ) .\n\u201d See the PDF document here : https : //files.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/guidelines/covid19treatmentguidelines.pdf This is indeed strange , especially in the middle of a pandemic .\nOne would expect that , in order to save patient lives , doctors would look for and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as there were no safety issues .\nWhen clearly there is evidence of no-harm , and increasingly powerful evidence that certain treatments can save lives , it would be highly unethical for Doctors NOT to start using such treatments .\nDoctors use medicines for purposes other than those listed on the label all the time !\nSince Ivermectin and HCQ are both on the WHO list of essential medicines and have been so for a long time \u2013 decades in the case of HCQ \u2013 the world knows about the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example , since 1992 , Ivermectin has only been linked to 16 deaths , whereas deaths linked to the COVID-19 vaccines are now in the thousands ( information from the Uppsala Drug Monitoring Centre run by the WHO ( https : //www.who-umc.org ) via Prof Paul Marik , Chief of Critical Care & Pulmonary Medicine , EVM , USA ) .\nClearly , something appears very much out of balance here .\nThere ARE effective treatments for COVID-19 , yet the institutions that we rely on for medical guidance appear to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 even though they are known to be safe after many decades of use .\nDespite their known safety , neither Ivermectin nor HCQ have been able to obtain even an EAU ( Emergency Use Authorization ) !\nAt the same time , new creations that have only had very limited testing , and for which the safety can not be known in such a short period of time , are approved for emergency use .\nThe world economy is now in dire straits , with entire populations having been essentially under house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months .\nPeople continue to die from ( or with ) COVID-19 without treatments being available .\nAnd we are now seeing important examples of breakout infections in people who have already been vaccinated against COVID-19 .\nAs Reuters reported just a few days ago , \u201c Hundreds of vaccinated Indonesian health workers get COVID-19 , dozens in hospital \u201d .\nThis is just one many similar news stories reporting the very same phenomenon .\nAccording to the pharmaceutical manufacturers themselves , the current range of emergency use vaccines do not actually provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d of COVID-19 .\nWhile this issue has yet to be fully resolved , many in the mainstream are still claiming that these vaccines will \u201c inoculate \u201d the recipient against the novel coronavirus .\nTherefore , these jabs should rightly be categorised as a type of treatment against the disease of COVID-19 , and not a vaccine against the said pathogen , the SARSCoV2 coronavirus .\nIt goes without saying that the wide availability of cheap and effective drug treatments for COVID would severely undermine the widely touted mainstream claim that mass-vaccinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or \u2018 defeating \u2019 a supposed global pandemic .\nClearly , effective treatments are absolutely required at this point .\nThe good news is that there are such treatments available .\nWith effective treatments in hand , the global COVID-19 situation could end in as little as a few weeks .\nThe world CAN return to normal .\nSadly , there seem to be forces at work blocking such an outcome .\nWe need to ask : why are these effective treatments not being allowed in so many places ?\nWhy is information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that treatments like Ivermectin and HCQ are off patent and extremely cheap might give us a clue .\n*** Author Chris Lonsdale is a psychologist , linguist , educator , entrepreneur , dialogue facilitator and corporate advisor with over thirty years experience

COVID Measures Are Unconstitutional", "content": "The Constitutional Court has concluded that the government should have resorted to a state of emergency \u2013 which requires prior parliamentary approval \u2013 to limit fundamental rights for the nationwide lockdown Spain is the latest EU member state to fall foul of its own laws and constitution , having imposed permanent draconian laws and restrictions starting with the initial mass hysteria of the alleged \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 in March 2020 \u2013 and still carrying on with measures in 2021 .\nThe legal battleground here is familiar one : many governments have bypassed normal legislative due process and democracy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree.\n\u2019 Rather than go through the normal democratic checks and balances required to prove the basis for , and declare a \u2018 state of emergency \u2019 ( and risk having to actually prove \u2018 the science \u2019 being used to impose a state of emergency ) , governments have cleverly bypassed this process by simply declaring a vague and arbitrary \u2018 state of alarm \u2019 \u2013 effectively giving itself carte blanche to do what it wants as long as it wants , and make endless changes to the parameters of its decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a never ending crisis .\nWhen challenged in the country \u2019 s top constitutional court , the ill-conceived lockdown power-grab has been found illegal .\nSpain \u2019 s Constitutional Court has ruled that the state of alarm that was implemented by the central government in March 2020 at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic was unconstitutional .\nIn a close vote of six against five , the judges found that such a lockdown , which saw Spaniards confined to their homes apart from for essential activities such as buying food , should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Spanish law , the state of emergency .\nThis would have required the prior approval of the lower house of parliament , the Congress of Deputies .\nThe decision has been reached by the Constitutional Court after two meetings of the judges , during which a draft sentence on the state of alarm written by magistrate Pedro Gonz\u00e1lez Trevijano \u2013 from the court \u2019 s conservative sector \u2013 was debated .\nIn the text , the judge argued that the state of alarm imposed by the government last March did not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of assembly between private citizens , but suspended them altogether .\nEver since the coronavirus pandemic arrived in Spain , there has been a debate among constitutional experts as to whether a state of emergency was needed .\nArticle 116 of the Spanish Constitution describes three legal categories for emergency situations : state of alarm , state of emergency and state of siege ( in Spanish : estado de alarma , estado de excepci\u00f3n and estado de sitio ) .\nFor some of those involved in the debate , the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these rights , while for others the lockdown was , in practice , such an intense restriction that it was equivalent to the suppression of fundamental rights , thus requiring a state of emergency .\nAnother key difference relates to the fact that a state of alarm is initially agreed on by the government and subsequently debated in Congress , where it is approved or rejected by deputies .\nThis allows the executive to act with a certain level of speed once a decision has been taken to go down this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised after the state of alarm has been implemented .\nIn contrast , a state of emergency is not directly agreed by the government .\nThe proposal is first taken to Congress , and it is parliament that declares the emergency situation .\nOne of the serious drawbacks to a state of emergency would have been the more severe restrictions on fundamental rights that it would have brought with it .\nLegal experts have pointed to the fact that a state of emergency is subject to less oversight , and allows the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detain people from three to 10 days with no judicial supervision .\nPolice can also enter homes or establishments with the use of force \u2013 i.e .\nknocking down the door \u2013 when they deem it necessary , and also without any prior authorization from the courts .\nThe authorities can also close down media outlets under a state of emergency , all in the name of maintaining public order .\nOther constitutionalists have defended that the use of the state of alarm during the first stage of the pandemic \u2013 a measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ideological stripes in Congress \u2013 was the appropriate move in a health emergency such as the coronavirus crisis .\nThey argued that the state of emergency should be used when serious public order problems are occuring .\nIn any event , the point on which the judges from the Constitutional Court agreed from the start was that any annulment of the lockdown that was in place between March and June last year should not involve any kind of liability for the state .\nAs such , there was agreement that no claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private citizens who suffered economic losses as a result of the state of alarm\u2026", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

Admits: \u2018Vaccinated People May Be Spreading The Delta Variant\u2019", "content": "It was only a matter of time .\nAfter months of constantly moving the goalposts and revising claims about what this range of unlicensed experimental COVID injections can and can \u2019 t do , public health bureaucrats are now losing control of their own dubious narrative .\nAfter spending billions of dollars in advertising and marketing for the new COVID jabs , including millions earmarked for celebrities and social media \u2018 influencers , \u2019 government experts have suddenly rescinded previous claims that the \u2018 vaccines \u2019 provided immunity for SARSCoV2 .\nBut this latest move by the US government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously compliant vaccinated public .\nThe Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) announced on Friday that not only do the jabs not provide any immunity to the so-called \u2018 novel \u2019 coronavirus ( a fact widely known by astute non-mainstream journalists and commentators since 2020 ) , but that those who went and got vaccinated are now spreaders of COVID .\nA recent outbreak in Barnstable , Massachusetts has shown the majority of COVID infections were found among the vaccinated , with three quarters ( 74 % ) of the cases happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these 346 cases being men with a median age of 42 years ) .\nThe New York Times was quick to add the caveat to their headline , assuring the vaccinated that \u201c Vaccinated People May Spread the Virus , Though Rarely , \u201d assuring the vaccinated that everything is still safe .\nWhile appearing to be counter-intuitive from an official narrative point of view , this CDC admission should be viewed as a strategic move by government in preparation for the fall and winter season \u2013 as Western governments are planning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and resume intermittent lockdowns in response to some new \u2018 variant \u2019 supposedly in circulation .\nIn this upcoming scenario , the vaccinated will be required to lockdown and wear masks alongside the increasingly marginalised unvaccinated population \u2013 a strategy certain to create even more social and political division and tension .\nTheir ultimate aim will be to use this next phase of \u2018 crisis \u2019 in order to vaccinate as many children as possible during the 2021-2022 school year .\nMoreover , plans are afoot to market a new COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine this coming autumn and winter , including plans by mRNA gene-jab giant Moderna to release a 2-in-1 Flu-COVID combo injection in the very near future .\nNot surprisingly , this latest revision of \u2018 The Science \u2019 by the CDC has come as a major shock to many millions of members of the public who trusted government and media and volunteered to take part in the world \u2019 s largest-ever pharmaceutical experiment .\nWhen revising its mask guidance this week to urge even vaccinated people to wear masks indoors in much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control and Prevention was criticized for not citing data in making that move .\nNow it has \u2014 and the data is sobering .\nThe study details a COVID-19 outbreak that started July 3 in Provincetown , Mass.\n, involving 469 cases .\nIt found that three-quarters of cases occurred in fully vaccinated people .\nMassachusetts has a high rate of vaccination : about 69 % among eligible adults in the state at the time of the study .\nIt also found no significant difference in the viral load present in the breakthrough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other cases , suggesting the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with the coronavirus is similar .\nThe CDC said the finding that fully vaccinated people could spread the virus was behind its move to change its mask guidance .\n\u201c High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that , unlike with other variants , vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus , \u201d Dr. Rochelle Walensky , the CDC \u2019 s director , said in a statement Friday .\n\u201c This finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to CDC \u2019 s updated mask recommendation .\nThe masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others , including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones , \u201d Walensky said\u2026 PLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA

area of Eastern Afghanistan \u2013 an Osama Bin Laden propaganda poster supposedly found by members of a US Navy ( USN ) Seal Team ( Image Source : Britannica ) President Biden has now taken it upon himself to end \u201c America \u2019 s longest occupation , \u201d as expressed by the progressive talk show host Thom Hartmann .\nWhile he was Vice President , his then-boss Barack Obama actually attempted to retreat from the Hindu Kush , even making bold claims at the time : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in Afghanistan remains the end of 2016 .\nThat hasn \u2019 t changed .\nOur transition out of a combat role has not changed.\n\u201d Alas , that was not to be\u2026 nor was he able to keep the promise he made \u2018 on his third day in office , \u2019 back in 2009 : President Obama ordered the detention facilities at Guantanamo to be closed \u201c as soon as practicable , and no later than one year from the date of this order.\n\u201d But facts on the ground can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to change or re-arrange .\nNacht und Nebel : Abandoning the Mission in the Hindu Kush That was then , and this is now : about twelve and a half years later .\nThe BBC reported the other day that the \u201c US military left Bagram Airfield \u2013 its key base in Afghanistan \u2013 in the dead of night without notifying the Afghans , the base \u2019 s new commander said \u201d ( 7 July 2021 ) .\nAbout a fortnight earlier , President Biden said that \u201c Afghans are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want , \u201d adding that the \u201c senseless violence has to stop \u201d ( 25 June 2021 ) .\nThis all might give the impression that the dynamic duo of Obama and Biden are the main culprits that ordered American soldiers to go fight in the Hindu Kush .\nInstead , another odd couple really bears full responsibility : namely , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush , as \u201c the invasion of the Hindu Kush .\n.\n.\nwas [ actually ] the brainchild of a number of experts during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting carrying the heading \u2018 Brainstorming on Afghanistan \u2019 and [ that ] was apparently the outcome of the Clinton administration \u2019 s concerns over Osama bin Laden , \u2019 going back to the 1998 attacks on two US embassies in Africa \u2013 in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi .\nBut it was down to 9/11 and George W. Bush to ignite the Afghan powder keg , leading to a conflagration subsequently deftly and somewhat ineptly handled by the Nobel Peace Prize-wielding Barack Obama , \u201d and then by his successor Donald J @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a swift and sudden retreat overseen by the current POTUS .\nIn fact , Joe Biden has now decided to stick to \u201c America \u2019 s commitment .\n.\n.\nto finally withdraw from Afghanistan , \u201d a deal that had been \u201c negotiated between the Trump administration and the Taliban , \u201d as relayed by the columnist and cartoonist Ted Rall .\nAnd , the U.S. President has set himself a symbolic \u201c September 11 , 2021 deadline for [ this supposedly final ] withdrawal of the last U.S. troops.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 spurred Bush , Jr. to invade the Hindu Kush in order to capture Osama bin Laden , the alleged mastermind behind the audacious 2001 attacks on America \u2013 Bush presented Bin Laden as the alleged brains behind the realization of a \u201c new Pearl Harbor , \u201d as presciently coined in the Project for the New American Century ( PNAC , 1997-2006 ) \u2019 s seminal report , Rebuilding America \u2019 s Defences : strategy ,

.\n.\n.\nis likely to be a long one , absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event \u2013 like a newPearl Harbor .\n.\n.\nAny serious effort at transformation must occur within the larger framework of U.S. national security strategy , military missions and And 9/11 was the \u201c new Pearl Harbor \u201d that was needed , not just to transform the Pentagon , but the whole of American society and the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like the original Pearl Harbor attack ( 7 December 1941 ) had ushered in America \u2019 s fight against Hitler , the Nazi movement and its allies , turning that European conflict into a veritable World War , 9/11 ( 11 September 2001 ) provided the impetus for the global War-on-Terror .\nThis war \u2019 s first battleground was the Hindu Kush ( 7 October \u2013 17 December 2001 ) , but rather than hunt down Osama bin Laden supposedly hiding in the Tora Bora mountains before moving to Abbottabad in neighbouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family\u2014wives , children and grandchildren \u201d ( early in 2006 , apparently ) , the Bush administration quickly turned its attention to Iraq and Saddam Hussain ( 19-20 March 2003 being the dates of the actual invasion ) \u2013 leaving Afghanistan in a state of constant terror and war for the next 20 years .\nThe always intrepid John Pilger put it like this : \u201c On the morning of 12 September 2001 , without any evidence of who the hijackers were , [ then-Secretary of Defense Donald ] Rumsfeld [ 1932-2021 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alas , the invasion of Iraq was temporarily postponed , because the then-Secretary of State Colin Powell persuaded Bush and Cheney ( the gruesome twosome running the American show at the time , with the former taking the limelight and the latter , the decisions ) that \u201c public opinion has to be prepared before a move against Iraq is possible , \u201d and as a result , Afghanistan was chosen as the softer option \u2013 the mere fact that Bin Laden happened to be there was merely fortuitous .\nThe invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely rich and ensured a second term for the gruesome twosome to run the show and consolidate Halliburton \u2019 s gains and profits \u2013 between 1995 and 2000 , Cheney served as chairman of the board and CEO of the company , receiving a trifle $ 12.5m in salary , while holding $ 39m-worth of stock options .\nIn Iraq , Halliburton obtained a huge number of no-bid contracts .\nThe journalist David Rosenbaum relates matter-of-factly that \u201c Halliburton \u2019 s business with the [ U.S. ] military has grown substantially since Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company rose to seventh-largest military contractor in 2003 from 22nd-largest in 2000.\n\u201d Additionally , Rosenbaum divulges that , \u201c since becoming vice president-elect , \u201d Cheney \u201c has received $ 1,997,525 from \u201d Halliburton : $ 1,451,398 in a bonus deferred from 1999 , the rest in deferred salary .\nAnd according to the investigative journalist and progressive author Pratap Chatterjee , Cheney was able to strike further lucrative gold deposits after joining Bush as nominal Vice President : In spite of these lucrative outcomes of 11 September 2001 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the return of the once and future rulers of Afghanistan : the Taliban , who have been making steady gains since early May .\nAmerican Boots around the World : Establishing the American Empire But Biden will have unburderned the American public-at-large of a big and troublesome worry , as American boots will have finally left the mountainous \u201c Graveyard of Empire.\n\u201d Rather poetically , James Fergusson and Gerald Hughes remark that \u201c over the centuries , the myth of Afghan invincibility [ has been ] reinforced as the greatest powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mongols , the Mughals , the British , the Soviet Union and , most recently , the United States \u2013 [ have ] found their might rendered impotent \u201d in the Hindu Kush .\nOn the other hand , there are still many other locations around the globe where American boots continue to stomp around .\nIn \u201c nearly 800 military bases in more than 70 countries and territories abroad , \u201d to be precise , as dryly stated by the sociologist , Dr David Vine .\nThe geographical scope is breath-taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Japan to Honduras .\nVine matter-of-factly states that \u201c American military bases encircle the globe.\n\u201d On the Fourth of July this year , Dr Vine tweeted : \u201c Entering the 246th year in US history , and the US military is still at war .\n.\n.\nWhat will it take to turn the US away from war ?\nWhat will we do to make the US a country dedicated to peace ?\n\u201d The mere existence of these U.S. bases around the globe is nothing but the outcome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promulgated in 1947 .\nThe U.S. State Department \u2019 s Office of the Historian , directed by Dr Adam Howard since 2019 , explains that President Truman ( 1945-53 ) \u201c effectively reoriented U.S. foreign policy , away from its usual stance of withdrawal from regional conflicts not directly involving the United States , to one of possible intervention in far away conflicts \u201d \u2013 \u2018 possible \u2019 interventions made feasible and practicable as a result of a global network of U.S. military bases .\nThis network of bases constitutes the main reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an American Empire \u2013 an empire unlike any other , such as the British or the Roman empires that were based territorial acquisition and/or the imposition of colonial rule in faraway locations .\nInstead the American Empire is one based on economic gains and other strategic benefits accrued as a result of the ever-present threat of military force and coercion .\nThis military component of the American enterprise is directed from the U.S. Central Command at the MacDill Air Force Base , in Tampa , Florida ( aka CENTCOM ) .\nAdditionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centres \u2013 from AFRICOM ( located in Germany \u2019 s Stuttgart ) over INDOPACOM ( on Hawaii ) to additional Functional Combatant Commands , such as the Special Operations Command SOCOM ( in Florida ) or CYBERCOM ( in Maryland ) .\nThis more than impressive military footprint controlled from these 11 nerve centres effectively ensures that the American Empire never gets short-changed ( whatever President Trump may have been

the population ?\nDo lockdowns really save lives , as the government and mainstream media claim ?\nBack in September of 2020 , 21WIRE re-posted a crucial comment by Nobel Prize winner Professor Michael Levitt from Stanford University in addressing this very issue : \u201c Panic is dangerous and it shortens your life \u2026 .\nWhat \u2019 s important is the values of our society .\nI asked in an earlier blog post : what can we do to stop this voluntary suicide of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u2019 s facing us : with \u2018 ZeroCovid , \u2019 you can pretty much guarantee that the demise of western civilisation will be greatly accelerated.\n\u201d Levitt elaborated on this same issue in a previous interview in May 2020 , talking about the traditional key metric in public health decision-making which seems to have been discarded as soon as the Covid crisis began , that is \u2018 Disability-Adjusted Life Years.\n\u2018 Levitt explains : \u201c Economists have a very simple way of of looking at death .\nThey don \u2019 t count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conclusion that if you \u2019 re 20 ( years old ) and you die that \u2019 s a greater loss than if you \u2019 re 85 , and you die .\nIt \u2019 s a hard issue , but \u2026 .\nare we evaluating the potential of future \u2013 like of the 20 year old , or are we valuing the loss of a more senior person by what \u2019 s called DALY , \u2018 Disability-Adjusted Life Years.\n\u2019 Basically , if somebody is in their 80 \u2019 s and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from pneumonia perhaps due to Corona , that is less of a \u2018 loss \u2019 than if a 15 year old is riding his motorcycle , or his bike , and gets run over .\nSo this is an important way of looking at the death.\n\u201d In other words , the \u2018 cure \u2019 being prescribed by governments mandating mass-quarantines \u2013 is actually much , much worse than the alleged disease itself .\nThe following is a rare honest report from ABC Australia , entitled , \u201c Lockdowns , lifespans and COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion here \u2013 from a mainstream outlet which has been steadily pumping out propaganda since the beginning of Australia \u2019 s non-existent \u2018 pandemic \u2019 .\n\u201c In a controversial new analysis , Dr Cameron Murray of the Henry Halloran Trust at the University of Sydney argues some harsh COVID responses can end up shortening lives .\nBut we may not know for several years.\n\u201d THE LONGEVITY MACHINE : COVID19 HARSH RESPONSES MAY INDEED SHORTEN LIVES \u2013 Do restrictions also slow down the so-called longevity machine \u2013 that web of

published in 1988 entitled Manufacturing Consent , deconstructing how the corporate media functions in relation to government propaganda operations and engineering a public \u2018 consensus \u2019 on any issue , large or small .\nThe formula is simple once you understand it , and this analysis has never been more useful than right now during this so-called \u2018 global pandemic.\n\u2019 Watch this excerpt from the documentary , \u201c Manufacturing Consent : Noam Chomsky and the Media \u201d ( 1992 ) .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy or a republic , but according to Chomsky , both notions may well be illusory .\nInstead , Chomsky argues in Manufacturing Consent\u2014his 1988 critique of \u201c the political economy of the mass media \u201d with Edward S. Herman\u2014that the mass media sells us the idea that we have political agency .\nTheir \u201c primary function\u2026 in the United States is to mobilize support for the special interests that dominate the government and the private sector.\n\u201d Those interests may have changed or evolved quite a bit since 1988 , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as \u201c effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function \u201d might work in the age of Twitter just as they did in one dominated by network and cable news .\n[ That consent is manufactured using the following 5 components : ] 1 .\nMedia Ownership\u2014The endgame of all mass media orgs is profit .\n\u201c It is in their interest to push for whatever guarantees that profit.\n\u201d 2 .\nAdvertising\u2014Media costs more than consumers will pay : Advertisers fill the gap .\nWhat do advertisers pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It isn \u2019 t just that the media is selling you a product .\nThey \u2019 re also selling advertisers a product : you.\n\u201d 3 .\nMedia Elite\u2014 \u201c Journalism can not be a check on power , because the very system encourages complicity .\nGovernments , corporations , and big institutions know how to influence the media .\nThey feed it scoops and interviews with supposed experts .\nThey make themselves crucial to the process of journalism .\nIf you want to challenge power , you \u2019 ll be pushed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be getting in .\nYou \u2019 ll have lost your access.\n\u201d 4 .\nFlack\u2014 \u201c When the story is

\u201c To manufacture consent , you need an enemy , a target : Communism , terrorists , immigrants\u2026 a boogeyman to fear helps corral public opinion.\n\u201d Chomsky and Herman \u2019 s book

this crisis .\nWe are in a phase of religious fundamentalist totalitarianism .\nIn this phase , which is reaching its hysterical climax , the Vaccine is the new God .\nThe parallel with religions in their extremes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religions in the original sense , one of whose accepted etymologies is religare , to connect [ 1 ] .\nAll religions have been used by a part of their hierarchy to

forgiveness , inclusion , justice , goodness in words but in fact killed , separated , judged , imprisoned and exterminated by means of zealous sadistic , psychopathic , fanatical executors .\nIf people want trustworthy rulers , honest politicians , they should always judge rulers , financial elites , politicians by their actions rather than by their words .\nAn example of this in Belgium was the appointment in 2020 of a person who had already defrauded , lied and betrayed [ 2 ] years earlier as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , it must be said that in Belgium , elections or not , citizens have no control over ministerial appointments .\nSimilarly , in France , the Minister of Justice is \u2026 indicted while retaining his position [ 3 ] .\nHe obviously retains the support of his government .\nLet us continue the parallel between the Vaccine and God .\nIn this story of the Almighty Vaccine , there are also many sincere believers .\nSome are even the fanatics , the token extremists .\nNo matter what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it won \u2019 t change anything .\nA French minister said it in these fundamentalist terms in 2015 , \u201c Vaccination is not debatable \u201d [ 4 ] .\nI told you , many believers are sincere .\nIsn \u2019 t Hell paved with good intentions ?\nFor the Vaccine God , they do not ask for proof .\n\u201c It has been said that Vaccination saved humanity

any deviation from his faith .\nIt is even on this characteristic that we identify him , that we distinguish a believer from a true scientist who doubts , who relies on a provisional truth to advance , from question to question , never satisfied with ready-made answers .\nFor the RNA/DNA \u201c vaccine \u201d , all indulgences are allowed , even though the technology has been studied for several years , these products are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmaceutical companies \u2019 studies are in phase III [ 5 ] , their marketing authorization is conditional , and the side effects , and even deaths , are

drapes itself in objectivity , rationality but in the case of Vaccination , it is only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In reality , the belief in vaccination is nothing but subjectivity , emotionality and faith

fundamentalists of Vaccination , others could say about the antivax , and it is true , for some .\nThe fundamentalists of Vaccination as an exclusive religion have a lot of fun to make amalgams , to put all their opponents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to criticize .\nFor my part , I consider vaccination , even this RNA/DNA genetic manipulation , as an option , why not , provided that all the authorization phases are respected , that warning signals are taken into account and that time is taken to ensure safety .\nThe issue , for me , is not to demonize vaccination as the fundamentalists of it demonize

the way out of this crisis .\nThese alternatives will not make money for the big laboratories and Big Pharma whose stock market shares have skyrocketed thanks to the Vaccine God , they will not allow the rulers tempted by an absolute takeover of our lives to achieve their ends .\nBut these safer , more effective , less dangerous alternatives will work , they will remove the danger , including the variants , without exposing a part of humanity to unacceptable side effects [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 ] , to an irreversible locking up of our liberties .\nThese notions are essential to understand how to fight this fanaticism , how to get out of this health nightmare and this totalitarianism which has the Vaccine as its God and which uses it to achieve its ends .\nIt is perfectly acceptable for Vaccine believers to sacrifice flocks for the common good , including healthy young people who give their lives so that the new God can save humanity .\nWhat would shock any sane person is seen as sanctification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address in the same way the cynics , those who only use this situation for their own profit ( political , financial , narcissistic ) , and the true believers , those who

neither dialogue nor forgiveness .\nWe must deal with them as a healthy human body deals with a parasite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe latter must be dealt with in the light of their sincere faith .\nVaccination is their right , but perhaps if they learned that there are more effective and less dangerous alternatives , they would come to their senses .\nAs for the most fanatical elements who are not cynical opportunists disguised as believers , for those who want everyone to be vaccinated , there is no way out , no way out other than to protect ourselves from them , for the common good , by keeping them away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in danger today , not because of what most people believe .\nNot because of a virus .\nBecause of the cynical psychopathy of a few , the blind Faith of some ,

Behind the \u2018Pandemic of the Unvaccinated\u2019", "content": "Editors Note : While we are skeptical about claims being made by government , media and medical professionals about the emergence of an alleged \u201c Delta Variant \u201d strain of the \u2018 novel \u2019 coronavirus , we have nonetheless published this piece by Dr Mercola as it contains a number of important argumentative points regarding wild claims being made by government and the mainstream media that the world is currently in the grips of a \u201c pandemic of the unvaccinated.\n\u201d Such claims do not even stand up to the most basic appraisal of the official data released by government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article in its entirety so that our readers may decide for themselves what \u2018 The Science \u2019 is .\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the White House and most mainstream media , what we have now is a \u201c pandemic of the unvaccinated.\n\u201d 1 According to the official narrative , 99 % of COVID-19 deaths and 95 % of COVID-related hospitalizations are occurring among the unvaccinated .\nIn a July 16 , 2021 , White House press briefing,2 CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky claimed \u201c over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital right now are unvaccinated.\n\u201d But as reported by Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham on \u201c The Ingraham Angle , \u201d \u201c that statistic is grossly misleading , \u201d 3 and in an August 5 , 2021 , video statement , Walensky inadvertently revealed how that 95 % to 99 % statistic was created .\nAs it turns out , to achieve those statistics , the CDC included hospitalization and mortality data from January through June 2021 .\nIt does not include more recent data or data related to the Delta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalent strain in circulation .\nThe problem is , the vast majority of the United States population was unvaccinated during that timeframe .\nJanuary 1 , 2021 , only 0.5 % of the U.S. population had received a COVID shot .\nBy mid-April , an estimated 31 % had received one or more shots,4 and as of June 15 , 48.7 % were fully \u201c vaccinated.\n\u201d 5 Keep in mind that you \u2019 re not \u201c fully vaccinated \u201d until two weeks after your second dose ( in the case of Pfizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six weeks after your first shot .\nThis is according to the CDC.6 So , those receiving an initial dose in June , for example , won \u2019 t be \u201c fully vaccinated \u201d until eight weeks later , sometime in July or August .\nBy using statistics from a time period when the U.S. as a whole was largely unvaccinated , the CDC is now claiming we \u2019 re in a \u201c pandemic of the unvaccinated , \u201d in an effort to demonize those who still have not agreed to receive this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s what Canadian viral immunologist and vaccine researcher Dr. Byram Bridle told Ingraham about the claim that we \u2019 re in a pandemic of the unvaxxed , and that the unvaccinated are hotbeds for dangerous variants : Bridle also explains why natural immunity offers robust protection against all variants , whereas vaccine-induced immunity can \u2019 t .\nWhen you acquire the infection naturally , your body develops antibodies against ALL of the viral proteins whereas the COVID shots only trigger antibodies against one , namely the spike protein .\nAs mentioned above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the viral proteins , the virus only needs to mutate that one protein in order to evade your immune system .\nWhen you have natural immunity , on the other hand , your antibodies will recognize all parts of the virus , so even if the spike protein is mutated , your body will recognize other parts of the virus and mount an attack against those .\nThat SARS-CoV-2 works the same way other viruses do was shown in a Nature Reviews Immunology study7 by Alessandro Sette and Shane Crotty , published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Cross-Reactive Memory T Cells and Herd Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 \u201d argued that naturally-acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is potent , long-lasting and very broad in scope , as you develop both antibodies and T cells that target multiple components of the virus and not just one .\nIf we are to depend on vaccine-induced immunity , as public health officials are urging us to do , we \u2019 ll end up on a never-ending booster treadmill .\nBoosters will absolutely be necessary , as the shot offers such narrow protection against a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data around the world show vaccine-induced protection is waning rapidly in the face of new variants , and Moderna has publicly stated that the need for additional boosters is expected.8 How Dangerous Is the Delta Variant ?\nAccording to Dr. Anthony Fauci , the Delta variant is both more transmissible and more dangerous than the original virus and previous variants .\nJuly 4 , 2021 , he told NBC News:9 In a June 29 , 2021 , interview,10 Fauci called the Delta variant \u201c a game-changer \u201d for unvaccinated people , warning it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals are protected against it .\nRemember , Fauci is not a clinician and has never treated someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 .\nOther health experts and practicing physicians who treat COVID-19 patients disagree with Fauci \u2019 s claims , arguing that not only is the Delta variant not more dangerous , it \u2019 s certainly not more dangerous for the unvaccinated .\nAs reported by Ingraham in June 2021 ( video above ) , there \u2019 s an evolutionary genetics theory called Muller \u2019 s Ratchet , which states that as an outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends to mutate into a more transmissible form , but at the same time it grows weaker , causing far less serious infection .\nAccording to epidemiologist and cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough , this is exactly what we \u2019 re seeing .\nHe told Ingraham : Importantly , the Delta variant contains three different mutations , all in the spike protein .\nThis , McCullough explains , allows this variant to evade the immune responses in those who have received the COVID jabs \u2014 but not those who have natural immunity which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a June 30 , 2021 , appearance on Fox News ( video above ) , McCullough stated:12 Real-World Data Show Most of Infected are Fully \u2018 Vaccinated \u2019 Real-world data from areas with high COVID jab rates show the complete converse of what media , the CDC and White House officials are telling us .\nIn addition to the British Technical Briefing No .\n16,15 cited above , we have additional data from Israel , Scotland , Massachusetts and Gibraltar : \u2022August 1 , 2021 , director of Israel \u2019 s Public Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of all COVID-19 infections were among the fully vaccinated.16 Signs of more serious disease among fully vaccinated are also emerging , she said , particularly in those over the age of 60 .\nA few days later , August 5 , Dr. Kobi Haviv , director of the Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem , appeared on Channel 13 News , reporting that 95 % of severely ill COVID-19 patients are fully vaccinated , and that they make up 85 % to 90 % of COVID-related hospitalizations overall.17 As of August 2 , 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one dose of Pfizer \u2019 s injection , which is used exclusively in Israel ; 62.2 % had received two doses.18 \u2022In Scotland , official data on hospitalizations and deaths show 87 % of those who have died from COVID-19 in the third wave that began in early July were vaccinated.19 \u2022A CDC investigation of an outbreak in Barnstable County , Massachusetts , between July 6 through July 25 , 2021 , found 74 % of those who received a diagnosis of COVID19 , and 80 % of hospitalizations , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all , had the Delta variant of the virus .\nThe CDC also found that fully vaccinated individuals who contract the infection have as high a viral load in their nasal passages as unvaccinated individuals who get infected.22 This means the vaccinated are just as infectious as the unvaccinated .\n\u2022In Gibraltar , which has a 99 % COVID jab compliance rate , COVID cases have risen by 2,500 % since June 1 , 2021.23 While those who benefit from keeping the pandemic going would like you to cower in fear at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there \u2019 s really no evidence that it \u2019 s any worse than the original .\nIt \u2019 s more transmissible , yes , but far less dangerous , as its primary symptoms are that of a regular cold .\nAccording to Harvard and Stanford professors , the actual number of Americans dying from or with COVID-19 are actually at an all-time low , so alarmism is uncalled for.24 And , as for viral social media posts by doctors and nurses claiming hospitals are overflowing with unvaccinated COVID patients , don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We \u2019 ve repeatedly seen evidence that fearmongering is being spread not by real people but by fake accounts run by artificial intelligence .\nThis includes blue check accounts .\nHere \u2019 s a sampling of recent bot farm tweets trying to scare everyone:25 Don \u2019 t Fear It , Just Treat It In closing , remember there are several different treatment protocols for COVID-19 that appear just as effective for variants as for the original virus , including the following : \u2022 Nebulized hydrogen peroxide for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 , @

Reconstruction ( SIGAR ) found US officials never had \u2018 realistic goals \u2019 for its nation-building project in Afghanistan \u2013 all this despite President Biden \u2019 s disingenuous claim that the mission \u201c was never supposed to have been nation building.\n\u201d The US government watchdog for Afghanistan released its final lessons learned report on Tuesday that said a \u201c victorious US withdrawal \u201d was impossible due to unrealistic and shortsighted goals set by Washington .\nSince its inception in 2008 , the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption and waste involved in Washington \u2019 s failed nation-building project in Afghanistan .\nThe report released Tuesday says that US officials never took seriously what it would take to establish a sustainable government in Afghanistan .\nThe report reads : \u201c The US government consistently underestimated the amount of time required to rebuild Afghanistan , and created unrealistic timelines and expectations that prioritized spending quickly .\nThese choices increased corruption and reduced the effectiveness of programs.\n\u201d SIGAR said Washington \u2019 s view on the project led to \u201c short-term solutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that started in 2009 during the Obama administration .\nThe report said the US created unrealistic timelines for transforming areas the US captured from the Taliban .\n\u201c US officials created explicit timelines in the mistaken belief that a decision in Washington could transform the calculus of complex Afghan institutions , powerbrokers , and communities contested by the Taliban , \u201d the report said .\nUltimately , the timelines created \u201c perverse incentives to spend quickly and focus on short-term , unsustainable goals that could not create the conditions to allow a victorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the US \u2019 s nation-building projected better than the speed at which the Taliban took over Afghanistan and how quickly the Afghan military rolled over .\nThe SIGAR report reads : \u201c When the United States began withdrawing its final forces from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021 , the Taliban took the opportunity to seize more than a quarter of the country in a matter of weeks , as Afghan security forces abandoned their posts or were overrun .\nThus , what Ambassador Nicholas Burns observed about the war \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Afghan government \u2018 can not survive without us.\n\u2019 \u201d SEE ALSO : Pentagon Mulls Options for Stay-Behind Strike Capability in Afghanistan Region Nicolas Burns served as George W. Bush \u2019 s NATO ambassador during the early years of the war .\nHe is one of many US government officials that SIGAR has interviewed over the years .\nIn December 2019 , The Washington Post published a cache of SIGAR interviews in a report known as the Afghanistan Papers .\nThe devastating release revealed what most critics of the war already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was losing the war and lied about it .\nSIGAR chief John Sopko told NPR that he hopes the latest report will teach the US not to do something like this again .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a tendency after failures like this or Vietnam to sweep it under the rug and say , we \u2019 re never going to do it again .\nWell , after Vietnam , we eliminated a lot of the capabilities to carry out counterinsurgencies and to try to develop countries .\nAnd guess what ?\nWe did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iraq .\nWe did it in Afghanistan .\nSo what we \u2019 re trying to tell people with this report is , let \u2019 s try to learn from the 20 years so we don \u2019 t do something this bad \u2026 again , \u201d he said .\nPresident Biden is under fire for how the withdrawal was played out .\nThe US is still evacuating personnel and Afghan allies from the Kabul airport .\nBut as the SIGAR report says , what the US would view as a \u201c victorious \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victorious \u201d withdrawal would involve the US funding the

Zealand: A One Horse Race in the Zero COVID Sweepstakes", "content": "By now , most sensible and sober people can agree that there is something seriously wrong going on in New Zealand , and that it \u2019 s got nothing to do with a coronavirus .\nIn this latest episode in a series of highly calculated , albeit reactionary moves by the government , New Zealand declared a new \u201c snap lockdown \u201d in the country after public health officials claimed to have discovered a \u2018 case \u2019 of COVID-19 .\nYes , you heard that right .\nOne single case .\nApparently , it was the first alleged \u2018 infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have emerged in the country \u2019 s most populous city , Auckland .\nIn ordering this shutdown , Ardern has established what can only be described as a post-modern standard for declaring the existence of a \u2018 pandemic.\n\u2019 Prior to this week , it seemed like Australia was world \u2019 s undisputed champion for baseless \u2018 snap \u2019 lockdowns .\nFew could hope to eclipse the fascist wokery of the country \u2019 s merry band of technocrats , led by Premiers Dan Andrews in Victoria , and Gladys Berejiklian in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even doggier gaggle of \u2018 public health \u2019 quislings led by NSW state pandemic tsars ; the irritable Brad Hazzard and his female sidekick , Dr Kerry Chant .\nIn recent weeks , this globalist syndicate Down Under has accelerated from specious lockdowns , to a full-on fundamentalist vaccine rampage .\nThe footage on social media of crazed public health officials and their foot soldiers ( literally in some cases , as they \u2019 ve now deployed the Australian armed forces to enforce Covid laws and help jab the population ) is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , Australia was the world \u2019 s leading congregation in the Cult of Zero Covid , with Chairman Dan and Gladys seemingly in competition with one another to see who could be more authoritarian and bombastic .\nJust last month , it took just six so-called \u2018 cases \u2019 ( PCR positive tests ) for Victoria Premier \u2019 s to flip his galactic circuit breaker to supposedly \u2018 stop the spread \u2019 ( the population of Victoria State is 6.8 million ) , and with that , throwing the region and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turmoil .\nGranted , Australian autocrats were pretty chuffed with themselves at that point .\nCoroni seemed to be no match for such unabashed vigilance , that is until a frenzied mare came charging around the bend .\nIn the global Zero COVID sweepstakes , New Zealand suddenly taken the lead in what now looks to be a one horse race .\nBecause once you lockdown your country for a single case \u2013 there isn \u2019 t anywhere else to go after that .\nThe bar can \u2019 t go any lower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrees a pre-emptive lockdown based on a feeling that Coroni is coming .\nI \u2019 m sure if you look hard enough , you can find some self-styled epidemiologist affiliated with an institution like Harvard , who will endorse that policy .\nNot unlike Xi Jinping and Kim Jung Un , PM Ardern has a penchant for grand symbolic gestures and true blue ideological virtue signalling .\nThis week was no exception .\nAfter not recording a locally transmitted \u2018 case \u2019 of COVID-19 in over six months , Ardern seized the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparatchiks claimed to have had identified where this mysterious single case originated ( although not exactly ) in the country \u2019 s largest city , Auckland .\nAccording to reports , claimed that there was possibly \u201c a link between the case and the border or managed isolation is yet to be established.\n\u201d Then came the old worn out trope .\n\u2018 We \u2019 re following The Science , \u2019 said public health mavens , assuring the public and a fawning media that this was all above board .\nArdern , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time enacting a \u201c Zero COVID \u201d lockdown set to last for seven days , covering both the Auckland and Coromandel areas , as well as a three day stint in the Corona Clink for the rest of the country .\nYes , it \u2019 s the old Delta Variant again .\nExperts insist that it could be lurking anywhere , waiting to pounce \u2013 from over the road , behind the bin , or maybe from the suspicious shrubbery next door .\nIn the world of Zero COVID , you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has been a noticeable atmosphere of derangement which has become rather palpable in recent days , with regime police forces now openly mocking and trolling the public .\nNew Zealand Police tweeted out on their official account , \u201c Who wants to play a game ?\nGo home , stay home .\nYou \u2019 re it.\n\u201d There is something seriously wrong with all this .\nThe government seems to care little how it is perceived , and certainly not by its own electorate .\nIt \u2019 s as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell-bent on a suicide run which is all but certain to derail any semblance of a democratic resolution to the current impasse .\nFor an increasing number of skeptical residents , the question now is : how long can the government carry on with the charade ?\nUnfortunately , as with Australia , and thanks to a diet of 24/7 state-sponsored mainstream media gaslighting and propaganda , much of the public have become acclimatised to the government \u2019 s vague prescriptions and constantly shifting Overton window of what constitutes \u2018 The Science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day to the next .\nIn this instance , Ardern \u2019 s high council once again reserves the right to extend the decree should another \u2018 case \u2019 appear on the scene , because , you know , you never can be too careful .\nAfter all , \u2018 we \u2019 re still in the midst of a pandemic.\n\u2019 \u201c Don \u2019 t congregate with your neighbours .\nDon \u2019 t talk to your neighbours .\nKeep in your bubbles , \u201d warned Ardern during her Oceanic press opportunity , borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chant \u2019 s B Movie horror script which aired last month in Sydney .\nWatch as Ardern holds an emergency press conference to explain just how serious this new case is : .\n\u201c We have seen what can happen elsewhere if we fail to get on top of it .\nWe only get one chance , \u201d said Ardern .\nIt \u2019 s now impossible to not question the scientific or rational basis behind Ardern \u2019 s increasingly demented authoritarian diktats .\nBut the government can surely count on the mainstream news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this virtual rat \u2019 s maze .\nAccording AFP , \u201c Officials said a major factor behind the strong response is the fact that the Auckland case has no obvious connection to the border or managed isolation.\n\u201d New Zealand garnered widespread praise from the transnational corporate media and globalist organisations like the World Economic Forum , and the Tony Blair Institute , for its extreme COVID response , boasting having only 26 total deaths \u201c from/with COVID \u201d out of a population of 5 million .\nIt \u2019 s All About the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ardern \u2019 s strange panic lockdown appears to be an attempt to leverage a mass-vaccination rollout in New Zealand .\nAs of this month , the country is way behind its other Five Eyes fraternal partners , and will have no doubt been ordered by its advisors Gates , Blair and the WEF , to seriously step it up the jabs .\nCurrently , only around 20 % of New Zealand \u2019 s population who have accepted the unlicensed experimental GMO \u2018 vaccine \u2019 gene-injection .\nLike Blair , Ardern is a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is .\nIf you haven \u2019 t worked it out by now , it \u2019 s about the vaccines .\nIt always was .\nAll the commotion about a virus , followed by a global mass-testing regime \u2013 was merely a platform upon which to build a new transnational corporate vaccine empire .\nThat \u2019 s the only logical explanation why any political leader , no matter how deranged and power-hungry they are , would risk fragile public confidence and invite a backlash by doing something as completely insane as locking-down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is most likely a false positive ) test .\nIf you look at the maniacal way in which the Australian government is currently prosecuting its mass-vaccination campaign \u2013 at a time which there isn \u2019 t anything even remotely resembling an epidemic , much less a pandemic \u2013 then it \u2019 s pretty clear that this was never about some virus .\nIt should be clear by now , that the supine nations of Australia and New Zealand are beta testing grounds for a new post-democratic , post-constitutional and post-enlightenment global world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism for an external locus of control .\nThe truth is coming out , along with reams of data , and plenty of peer-reviewed science which will eventually upend the \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 narrative .\nThe question is , will governments even listen , or are they now locked-in to an internationalised Zero COVID program ?\nWe \u2019 ll know for sure this winter .\nDo not be surprised when the next new \u201c variant of concern \u201d is introduced on the global stage .\nNor should you be surprised when

not be underestimated in this context .\nBrzezinski , as an American of Polish descent was then a rabid anti-Communist , and upon his appointment he immediately set up the Nationalities Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of weakening the Soviet Union by inflaming ethnic tensions among subject Soviet peoples , primarily targeting the Islamic populations living under communism .\nHe seems to have been particularly involved in the situation in Afghanistan , which wasn \u2019 t even part of the USSR .\nIn an interview conducted by the well-known French journalist Vincent Jauvert , published in Le Nouvel Observateur ( Jan. 15-21 , 1998 ) , Brzezinski made some astounding claims : \u201c According to the official version of history , CIA aid to the mujahedeen began during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan , Dec. 24 , 1979 .\nBut the reality , secretly guarded until now , is completely otherwise .\nIndeed , it was July 3 , 1979 , that President Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul and that very day I wrote a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention.\n\u201d He then qualifies his hyperbole somewhat : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t push the Russians to intervene , but we knowingly increased the probability that they would.\n\u201d The Carter administration thus willingly seems to have supported the mujahedeen and their foreign allies \u2014 the \u201c Afghan Arabs \u201d \u2014 in a bid to precipitate the Soviets \u2019 intervention and their ultimate demise .\nThe notorious Charlie Wilson famously exclaimed at the time , \u201c We had 58,000 dead in Vietnam , and we owe the Russians one.\n\u201d Upon Jauvert \u2019 s query regarding the Islamic blowback and its effects on contemporary society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security adviser simply retorted : \u201c What is most important to the history of the world ?\nThe Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire ?\nSome stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War ?\n\u201d .\n\u2019 The U.S. State Department \u2019 s Office of the Historian , directed by Dr Adam Howard since 2019 , still happily ignores historical reality and writes that the \u201c Carter administration had closely watched [ the Soviet ] buildup from the outset , its reaction following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , it clung to the hope that the Soviets would not invade , based on the unjustified assumption that Moscow would conclude that the costs of invasion were too high.\n\u201d But Brzezinski \u2019 s words published in Le Nouvel Observateur ( Jan. 15-21 , 1998 ) show that the Americans did not not shy away from fanning the flames of Islamic fundamentalism in order to defeat the Soviets .\nIn the 21st century , people and states are still experiencing the long-term blowback , a veritable orgy of violence that President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c [ s ] ome stirred-up Moslems.\n\u201d These \u2018 stirred-up Moslems , \u2019 with such colourful names as Al Qaeda and the Taliban , Boko Haram and ISIS or the Jabhat al-Nusra have determined and continue to determine the direction of U.S. and global foreign policy .\nFrom Fighting Communists to Battling the Taliban : America \u2019 s Role in the Hindu Kush Throughout the 1980 \u2019 s , the war in Afghanistan was the Cold War \u2019 s prime proxy-theatre , which even enterred popular culture with movie heroes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight the Communists in the mountains of the Hindu Kush .\nAnd in the end , the Soviet Union proved unable to withstand the U.S.-supported Islamic resistance , leading to the withdrawal of its forces in a \u201c well-executed and carefully planned disengagement operation \u201d that started in May 1988 and ended on 15 February 1989 .\nA Research Fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) , Franz-Stefan Gady , explains in some detail that it \u201c all began in November 1986 when the Soviet leadership under Mikhail Gorbachev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw all Soviet combat troops.\n\u201d As a result , Gorbachev summoned key members of the People \u2019 s Democratic Party of Afghanistan ( PDPA ) including its new General Secretary , Muhammad Najibullah , to Moscow in late 1986 and informed the Afghan communists that they had two years to prepare for the withdrawal of Soviet troops and to implement a policy of national reconciliation backed up by massive Soviet economic , financial , and military aid .\nThe signing of the so-called Geneva Accords , on April 14 , 1988 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union and the United States as guarantors , finally paved the way for the Soviet withdrawal from the Hindukush , while it also boosted Moscow \u2019 s hope for the future existence of a friendly , neutral government in Kabul under the leadership of Muhammad Najibullah .\nFollowing the Soviet withdrawal from the country .\nthe Democratic Republic of Afghanistan ( DRA ) survived for another three years before the whole country succumbed to a bloody civil war that saw various warlords fight each other until the \u201c Taliban armed group emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter of 1994 .\nMany of its members had studied in conservative religious schools in Afghanistan and across the border in Pakistan.\n\u201d The movement \u2019 s name is based on the Arabic word for student , which \u201c in the Pashto language .\n.\n.\nliterally means \u2018 one who is seeking , \u2019 or more specifically \u2018 someone who is seeking religious knowledge \u2019 , \u201d as explained by the professor of social sciences , David Dressel .\nStill , the Taliban version of Islam is quite unlike any other form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eminent journalist Ahmed Rashid : \u201c The Taliban represent nobody but themselves and they recognize no Islam but their own.\n\u201d Nevertheless , Rashid readily acknowledges the influence of the Deobandi school of Hanafi Islam practised and preached in Pakistan and going back to the teachings of such historical figures as Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi ( 1832\u201380 ) and Rash\u012bd A\u1e25mad Gangoh\u012b ( 1826\u20131905 ) .\nIn their zeal to spread the faith and propagate jihad , the Taliban ended up giving refuge to Osama bin Laden , which was to lead eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the subsequent war/occupation of 20 years that has now come to a sudden and abrupt end .\nThe Soviets proved unable to withstand the onslaught of the Mujahedeen and their successors , the Americans proved equally unable to withstand the Taliban , once again proving that Afghanistan really is the \u201c Graveyard of Empires.\n\u201d Alas , nobody would ever have expected the American withdrawal to be so haphazard and the Taliban victory to be so quick and complete .\nTaliban 2.0 or the Victory of Jihad ?\nThe Taliban had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until last Sunday ( 15 August 2021 ) , \u201c Taliban fighters sped down wide open highways on motorcycles and in captured government Humvees and police vehicles , rolling uncontested into the nation \u2019 s capital , \u201d as eloquently put by the New York Times .\nThe Afghan army did not put up a fight , but surrendered and fled the battlefield .\nAr least , that is how President Biden explained this military defeat : \u201c The truth is : This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders gave up and fled the country .\nThe Afghan military collapsed , sometimes without trying to fight.\n\u201d The U.S. President basically blamed the Afghan military , falling short of actually calling its soldiers cowards .\nWhat the U.S. President apparently failed to understand is the fact that the Taliban had been applying a \u201c strategy of coercion and persuasion \u201d for months , ever since Trump started negotiating with the Islamists , while failing to include representatives of the Afghan government .\nThe Taliban strategy apparently used the telephone as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jallal , a tribal elder in Baghlan Province in northern Afghanistan .\nJallal told reporters that a member of the Taliban called him simply saying \u201c If they do not surrender , we will kill them.\n\u201d And this telephone threat was repeated over and again at different locations throughout the whole of the country .\nIn other words , in the 21st century the Taliban behaved like latter-day incarnations of Genghis Khan ( d. 1227 ) and Timur Lenk ( 1336-1405 ) , nomadic leaders who had perfected the multi-faceted strategy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the author Erik Hildinger in his 1997 book Warriors Of The Steppe .\nGenghis and Timur used word of mouth propaganda to spread their threats of complete annihilation of cities and their populations in case of non-compliance .\nAnd the Taliban appear to have more or less done the same today .\nBiden seems unaware that fear and intimidation are potent persuaders , if the prospect is that one \u2019 s primary aid and support will simply vacate the premises .\nInstead , he waxed poetically about the reasons behind the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went to Afghanistan almost 20 years ago with clear goals : get those who attacked us on September 11th , 2001 , and make sure al Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us again .\nWe did that .\nWe severely degraded al Qaeda in Afghanistan .\nWe never gave up the hunt for Osama bin Laden , and we got him .\nThat was a decade ago.\n\u201d But , as I explained some weeks ago , the Bush administration did indeed go into Afghanistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was quick to abandon the mission in order to go into Iraq \u2013 that profitable country which \u201c floats on a sea of oil , \u201d as poetically promised by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz ( 2001-5 ) .\nEchoing George W. Bush \u2019 s words while debating Al Gore in the run up to the 2000 elections , Biden explicitly said that \u201c [ o ] ur mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation building .\nIt was never supposed to be creating a unified , centralized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what Bush ended up trying to do following his quick victory and subsequent inability to capture Bin Laden .\nIn his wake , President Barack Obama alliteratively said that the American mission in Afghanistan was to \u201c disrupt , dismantle , and defeat al-Qaeda , \u201d conveniently ignoring that the Americans were primarily fighting the Taliban .\nBush did launch the war-on-terror , which led to the deaths of more than 800,000 people and the displacement of 37 million more .\nWhile spending a trifle $ 145 billion on re-building Afghanistan in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction ( SIGAR ) released a timely report explaining that additionally the \u201c Department of Defense ( DOD ) has also spent $ 837 billion on warfighting , during which 2,443 American troops and 1,144 allied troops have been killed and 20,666 U.S. troops injured .\nAfghans , meanwhile , have faced an even greater toll .\nAt least 66,000 Afghan troops have been killed .\nMore than 48,000 Afghan civilians have been killed , and at least 75,000 have been injured since 2001\u2014both likely significant underestimations.\n\u201d Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laden and dismantle \u2018 Al Qaeda and its allies , \u2019 a \u201c U.S .\nreconstruction effort in Afghanistan \u201d took shape that \u201c could be described as 20 one-year reconstruction efforts , rather than one 20-year effort.\n\u201d It seems that in their desire not to be seen to engage in nation-building , the U.S. launched a nation-building effort that was short-term directed and hence destined to fail .\nAnd moreover , \u201c pervasive corruption put U.S. funds sent through the Afghan government at risk of waste , fraud , and abuse.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all American efforts in the Hindu Kush , the Taliban continued to pursue a guerrilla war to liberate their country from foreign occupation .\nFor even though , nowadays many people like to refer to the Taliban as \u201c terrorists , \u201d in reality these Islamist fighters primarily acted in defense of their own home country .\nThey were fighting a righteous jihad against America and its NATO allies .\nNowadays the term jihad is much bandied about and used and/or abused at will by Muslims as well as non-Muslims the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Sedgwick maintains that the concept of jihad was developed in the eighth century , when it basically functioned as a \u201c mixture of the Army Regulations and the Geneva Conventions , appropriate for the circumstances of the time.\n\u201d At the time of the Islamic conquests ( 7-8th centuries ) , the world was divided between the House of Islam ( Dar al-Islam ) and the House of War ( Dar al-Harb ) and international relations between both spheres were primarily military in nature .\nBut as the centuries progressed and relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quasi-peaceful status quo , punctuated by commercial exchanges and trade links , the idea of jihad changed as well .\nThere is the well-known distinction between the greater jihad ( al-jihad al-akbar ) and the lesser jihad ( al\u2013jihad al-asghar ) , between a personal struggle in the way of Allah ( crf .\nSurah 29:69 ) and an armed struggle to protect believers against oppression and violence perpetrated by unbelievers .\nIn other words , jihad evolved from a code of war into a defensive mechanism , tantamount to a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghanistan during the 1980s , the protection of the land from Soviet occupation warranted the execution of a jihad by locals and other sympathetic believers willing to participate in a meritorious act proving one \u2019 s commitment in the way of Allah ( al-jihad al-asghar ) .\nAnd that has also been what the Taliban have been doing for the past 20 years vis-\u00e0-vis the Americans .\nNow in the 2021 , this righteous jihad has been rewarded by another glorious defeat \u2013 in the last century , the Mujahedeen defeated the Soviets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans have been defeated by the Taliban .\nAnd in both cases the Afghan resistance fulfilled a religious duty in doing so ; and , both were merely defending their own homeland against oppression and violence perpetrated by unbelievers .\nBack in the 1970s , Zbigniew Brzezinski wanted to give the Soviets a taste of their own Vietnam in the Hindu Kush , and now in the 21st century , the Americans appear to have gone through their second Saigon moment in the Hindu Kush .\nWhen the Taliban rolled into Kabul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , U.S. Embassy staff engaged in a helicopter escape as had also been the case in Saigon ( 30 April 1975 ) .\nFollowing the rapid retreat from Bagram Airbase , President Biden had sounded confident : \u201c The Taliban is not the North Vietnamese army .\n.\n.\nThere \u2019 s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of the embassy of the United States from Afghanistan.\n\u201d Alas , that is just what happened .\nBut , 2021 \u2019 s real Saigon moment took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American airplane was preparing to take off rolling down the runway with hordes and hordes of desperate Afghan civilians pursuing the plane with a number even able to hold on to the bulk of the machine , clinging to the undercarriage , only to plummet to their deaths once the plane was airborne .\nThe Taliban victory was as swift as it was surprising , with even the Taliban \u2019 s deputy leader , Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar , saying that \u201c [ w ] e have reached a victory that wasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now presided over a \u201c defining geopolitical moment , \u201d a humiliating defeat at the hands of an arguably ill-equipped and weaker enemy .\nThe U.S. President , on the other hand , does not want to admit that much .\nBiden rather meekly avows that he merely respected the deal reached by his predecessor \u2013 Donald J. Trump .\nBut rather than trying to apportion appropriate blame at either George W. Bush , or Trump or Biden , in my opinion , in the wider context of the U.S. involvement in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be none other than peace-loving President Jimmy Carter .\nIn the Seventies he wholeheartedly adopted the Brzezinki strategy for defeating Communism by means of strengthening and employing radical Islam , which then morphed into accepted U.S. foreign policy : \u201c Liberal U.S. support and funding in conjunction with Saudi collusion and coaxing of various Islamist factions across the globe took place during the administrations of U.S. Presidents Carter , Reagan , and Clinton \u2014 from Afghanistan over Pakistan to Turkey ( and Bosnia ) , to name but a few salient locations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the case of Afghanistan , this meant that the U.S. supported the Mujahedeen as the Holy Warriors fighting against the godless Communists .\nIn time , these Holy Warriors transformed themselves into the Taliban \u2013 vile oppressors of women and eager growers of beards .\nPrior to 9/11 , these Islamists even used then-governor of Texas , George W. Bush , to get the ball rolling towards a much-vaunted pipeline project , as I explained at length previously .\nIn fact , even following the notorious 2001 terror attacks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the latter \u201c sternly rejected a Taliban offer to discuss handing over Osama bin Laden to a third country as U.S. jets began a second week of bombing \u201d in early October 2001 .\nBush was determined to invade the Hindu Kush as a precursor to his real goal , the invasion of Iraq .\nOne could even argue that the whole Bush-declared War-on-Terror was nothing but a direct consequence of the U.S. defeat of the Soviet Union , as a new enemy was needed and already found .\nIn April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994-5 ) made a programmatic announcement that has dominated foreign affairs ever since : \u201c Islamic militancy has emerged as perhaps the single gravest threat to the NATO alliance and to Western security \u201d , since the fall of Communism a few years earlier .\nThe 9/11 attacked seemed to prove Claes right and the subsequent \u201c War-on-Terror \u201d became nothing but a \u201c Crusade Against Islam , \u201d as I argued in 2016 .\nFive years later , it seems , radical Islam has defeated the United States in the Hindu Kush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staunch Bush ally , Tony Blair , published a scathing attack on the Trump-Biden withdrawal from Afghanistan , saying that \u201c every jihadist group around the world [ is now ] cheering \u201d .\n.\n.\nand it does now really appear that the U.S. has lost the War-on-Terror \u2013 in the Hindu Kush and perhaps more ominously , on the moral plane as well , given the ease with which President Biden chose to abandon the people of Afghanistan in order to bring American soldiers home and bring a supposed end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the globe .\n*** 21WIRE special contributor Dr. Can Erimtan is an independent historian and geo-political analyst who used to live in Istanbul .\nAt present , he is in self-imposed exile from Turkey .\nHe has a wide interest in the politics , history and culture of the Balkans , the greater Middle East , and the world beyond .\nHe attended the VUB in Brussels and did his graduate work at the universities of Essex and Oxford .\nIn Oxford , Erimtan was a member of Lady Margaret Hall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2002 .\nHis publications include the revisionist monograph \u201c Ottomans Looking West ?\n\u201d as well as numerous scholarly articles .\nIn Istanbul , Erimtan started publishing in the English language Turkish press , culminating in him becoming the Turkey Editor of the \u0130stanbul Gazette .\nSubsequently , he commenced writing for RT Op-Edge , NEO , and finally , the 21st Century Wire .\nYou can find him on Twitter at @ TheErimtanAngle .\nRead Can \u2019 s archive here .", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2021/08/23/abandoning-afghanistan-the-hindu-kush-in-u-s-foreign-policy-1979-2021/", "published": "Mon, 23 Aug 2021 16:16:49 +0000", "published_utc": 1629749809, "collection_utc": 1629756005}, {"id": "21stcenturywire--2021-08-23--VIDEO: Everything You Need to Know About Informed Consent \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s Your Right\u2019", "date": "2021-08-23", "source": "21stcenturywire", "title": "VIDEO: Everything You Need to Know About Informed Consent \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s Your Right\u2019", "content": "In Canada , informed consent to medical interventions \u2013 including vaccines \u2013 is the law .\nThe same is true @ @ @ @ @ , EU , Australia , and New Zealand .\nBut these governments , along with @ @ @ @ @ now running roughshod over what were once sacrosanct laws prohibiting misleading and coercive medical procedures @ @ @ @ @ a multibillion dollar media campaign of fear and mass-panic designed to pave-over the right to @ @ @ @ @ Covid Care Alliance supports Informed Consent .\nHere is what you need to know .\n@ @ @ @ @ .\nSupreme Court Judgment \u2013 Cuthbertson v.

future .\nAssange found hope in the potential of the internet to become a powerful tool for the emancipation of humanity .\nHe pointed to the power of cryptography to free the internet and , with people \u2019 s act of solidarity and resistance , can secure freedom in the offline world .\nIn \u201c Cypherpunks : Freedom and the Future of the Internet \u201d , he wrote : Informed by the philosophy of cypherpunk \u2013 a loosely connected online group that advocates for civil liberties with strong cryptography , Assange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using an unprecedented level of source protection , provided the public with a tool to fight against the coercion and secrecy of the state .\nIn his 2015 essay titled \u201c The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work \u201d , Phillip Rogaway , professor

capitalism , destroying civil liberties , a hope has emerged from the young generation who grew up on the internet .\nFrom Chelsea Manning to Edward Snowden , whistleblowers came forward to defend a

human history.\n\u201d Resistance against medical tyranny is fast growing .\nWhen the idea of a vaccine passport began to surface on the internet , Bitcoin Pleb , a faction of bitcoin users who believe in the power of cryptographically backed money to secure individual sovereignty , were the first ones to defend people \u2019 s right to medical freedom .\nAs the vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , large demonstrations have erupted .\nIn Italy , people gathered together to express their strong opposition against this medical apartheid , where vaccinated burned their vaccine passport in solidarity with

court proceedings , and was used as an excuse by the UK government to deny the public access to the court .\nThe extradition hearings took place within an almost total media blackout .\nAlso , the lockdown in the Belmarsh prison restricted visitation from his family and made it almost impossible for Assange \u2019 s lawyers to meet their client and prepare their defense .\nFurther , the judge vindictively dismissed the bail application for Assange \u2019 s temporary release that his legal team made on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a high risk of being infected in prison .\nJulian Assange reminded us ; \u201c Our task is to secure self-determination where we can , to hold back the coming dystopia where we can not , and if all else fails , to accelerate its self-destruction \u201d

most Americans the collapse of Afghanistan called into question Washington \u2019 s ability to manage the world .\nAfter devoting 20 years , thousands of lives , and trillions of dollars to creating a stable , democratic , and liberal Afghanistan , the entire Potemkin structure collapsed in 11 days .\nHundreds of thousands fled as the Taliban successively captured provincial capitals .\nTens of thousands thronged the Kabul airport in a desperate effort to escape the newly proclaimed Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had joined the security forces that were supposed to sustain their country , instead of leaving the fight to those who decided the regime was not worth defending , perhaps the outcome would have been different .\nMany liberal Afghans likely will be trapped in a

.\nWhatever the outcome , Washington dramatically demonstrated yet again that militarized social engineering is an art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other crises loom around the globe and , of course , those who demanded that America stay in Afghanistan now insist that Washington take on these new responsibilities , presumably to demonstrate improved levels of competence .\nConsider the extraordinarily brutal tricorner battle ongoing among Ethiopia , Eritrea , and Tigray .\nThe complex confrontation returns a peaceful region to its terrible past of war and oppression .\nEritrea spent three decades fighting for independence from Ethiopia as the latter moved from monarchy to communist dictatorship to generic authoritarian rule .\nEritrea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regime so infamously cruel and repressive that it was known as the North Korea of Africa ( according to Freedom House , Eritrea actually is less free than the North , rating just 2 out of 100 ) .\nFive years later Ethiopia and Eritrea staged a

the country \u2019 s politics .\nEritrea joined Ethiopia and the fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ababa and Asmara is complicated , but Ethiopia has enabled Eritrea \u2019 s atrocious Afwerki what had been well-deserved diplomatic isolation . )\nThe conflict is largely unknown to the American republic .\nHowever , it is a true humanitarian horror .\nAlas , US efforts to halt hostilities have proved unavailing .\nSEE ALSO : Ethiopia : Ethnic Apartheid and the Globalist Colonizers \u2019 Playbook The Washington Post recently committed by the parties .\nFor instance , Eritrean forces \u201c have committed among the war \u2019 s worst atrocities , including civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent they render victims infertile .\nIn its sanctions announcement , the Treasury Department said that Eritrean defense forces have gone house-to-house in search of Tigrayan families to evict and men and boys to execute .\nThose who survive must leave behind dead loved ones or face execution.\n\u201d Although Addis Ababa is slightly less repressive \u2013 only South Sudan , Syria , and Turkmenistan reach Eritrea \u2019 s depths , \u2013 Ethiopia \u2019 s \u201c troops have committed many of the crimes for which the United States is sanctioning Eritrea .\nAmnesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allied militias have also weaponized rape .\nEthiopian soldiers have forced Tigrayan women into sexual slavery , engaged in gang rapes and targeted Tigrayan women fleeing to neighboring Sudan.\n\u201d Lest you decide to toss in your lot with Tigray , however , its forces seem no less cruel .\nExplained the Post : \u201c civilians fleeing the conflict are accusing Tigrayan forces of committing a range of atrocities , including door-to-door executions , as they have widened the conflict beyond the borders of their own region .\nDisplaced people blame Tigrayan troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas , \u2019 Agence France-Presse reported.\n\u201d This is a terrible conflict and utterly wrong for all concerned .\nOf course , the combat should end .\nBut what can the US do ?\nThe Biden administration has not been silent .\nThe Atlantic Council \u2019 s : \u201c In fairness to President Joe Biden \u2019 s administration , its efforts have not been half-hearted .\nThe White House has doubled down on diplomatic engagement by appointing veteran diplomat Jeffrey Feltman as the first-ever special envoy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cajoling a reluctant U.N. Security Council to speak up , and corralling like-minded allies to keep the up the diplomatic pressure.\n\u201d However , the result , which should surprise no one , was zilch .\nIf countries and regions are willing to accept the high cost of going to war , why should we expect \u201c diplomatic pressure \u201d to halt the fighting ?\nIt \u2019 s worth making the effort , but that is likely to have an impact only if all parties are reluctant combatants or fear losing .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unsurprisingly , then , Hudson worried that the administration relied too long on diplomacy : \u201c Now , as the death toll continues to mount and more recruits join the fray , its delay in utilizing those measures is beginning to undermine its credibility.\n\u201d He suggested applying Magnitsky Act sanctions against human rights abusers .\nHe also urged Washington to \u201c sanction a wider range of individuals and entities .\nPotential targets could include individuals who are intentionally blocking humanitarian aid shipments ; those using social media and other information platforms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone seeking to undermine diplomatic efforts to achieve a cease-fire and long-term political settlement.\n\u201d No doubt , such penalties would inconvenience the guilty .\nHowever , they would do little to change government policy .\nLocal elites typically are more committed to the regime than to foreign visas and bank accounts .\nMoreover , Hudson advocated a formal ban on arms sales , a sensible step , though sometimes doing so has disproportionate and perverse impacts on combatants .\nWith Ethiopia continuing to purchase weapons from such countries as Iran and Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited impact , causing him to call for a UN embargo , which would require Chinese and Russian acquiescence , no sure bet .\nAvoiding the quagmire of secondary and financial sanctions , by which the US penalizes other nations \u2019 individuals and companies , Hudson advocated targeting local firms involved in the war effort , such as Ethiopian Airlines and the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia .\nHudson argued that \u201c stiff sanctions against them could curtail the government \u2019 s ability to make war and push the companies \u2019 executives to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] Abiy to pursue peace.\n\u201d These steps would damage national prestige and marginally weaken Ethiopia \u2019 s war-making ability , but businessmen would remain unlikely to challenge their authoritarian political leaders .\nThe war almost certainly would continue .\nIndeed , when have economic penalties caused governments to yield what they consider to be vital security or political interests ?\nThe Trump administration increased sanctions on a gaggle of states , some serious enough to be termed \u201c maximum pressure.\n\u201d However , the result was a complete bust .\nAlthough China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russia , Syria , and Venezuela all felt varying degrees of pain , none changed their policies as a result .\nEven the Washington Post , which ran an editorial urging the Biden administration to Do Something !\n, acknowledged a sense of futility : \u201c US sanctions against Eritrea probably will not force Eritrean troops out of the conflict .\nThe United Nations sanctioned Eritrea for nine years , in part for refusing to withdraw troops from neighboring Djibouti , and the country did not relent .\nBut they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s government and to Tigrayan forces that the world is watching this horrific war \u2013 and that the United States will act .\nThe United States should use whatever leverage it has not only to end human rights abuses but also to force both sides to the bargaining table.\n\u201d This is a terribly unserious argument from a supposedly serious

of experimental COVID-19 injections are \u201c safe and effective.\n\u201d But is it actually true ?\nAlongside the pharmaceutical cartel , politicians and media have repeated ad nauseum that these vaccines are \u201c 95 % effective against the disease , \u201d but provide little or no context as to what that statement actually means in reality .\nThe real answer has been exposed in multiple peer-reviewed studies ( here and here ) , and by advocacy watchdog groups \u2013 clearly showing that their broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly exaggerated .\nAs for safety claims , this could not possibly have been known in late 2020 and early 2021 as the politicians and pharma executives claimed at the time \u2013 after only a few short months of corporate clinical trials .\nAdverse reaction and fatality data from VAERS ( US ) , Yellow Card ( UK ) and EudraVigilance ( EU ) tells another story , one which is being intentionally ignored by mainstream media and \u2018 public health \u2019 officials .\nIn truth , it will take years before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damage which has been inflicted .\nThe result of this concerted public relations and propaganda campaign has been a sales and marketing tsunami which has successfully cajoled the majority of the public into believing that these vaccines were the equivalent of a \u2018 panacea \u2019 against the SARSCOV2 virus and COVID-19 disease .\nHowever , upon closer examination , this carefully constructed facade quickly begins to crumble .\nAnd you only have to look at their own official data to see the scale of the deception .\nA graduate of Yale University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University and an MD degree from the John Hopkins University School of Medicine has published a paper in which she concludes that mandating the public to take a vaccine is a harmful and damaging act because of excellent scientific research papers which clearly demonstrate the vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission of Covid-19 .\nNina Pierpont ( MD , PhD ) published a paper on September 9th analysing various studies that were published in August 2021 which prove the alleged Delta Covid-19 variant is evading the current Covid-19 injections on offer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Covid-19 .\nThe Doctor of Medicine explained in her published paper that vaccines aim to achieve two ends \u2013 \u2022 Protect the vaccinated person against the illness \u2022 Keep vaccinated people from carrying the infection and transmitting it to others .\nNina Pierpont_Paper 2021However , the Doctor of Medicine writes that herd immunity will not be reached through vaccination because new research in multiple settings shows that the alleged Delta variant produces very high viral loads which are just as high in the vaccinated population compared to the unvaccinated population .\nTherefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , PhD ) , vaccine mandates ; such as the one now enforced in the UK for all Care Home staff , have no justification because vaccinating individuals does not stop or even slow the spread of the alleged dominant Delta Covid-19 variant .\nWhich leads the Doctor of Medicine to conclude that natural immunity is much more protective than vaccination because all severities of Covid-19 illness produce healthy levels of natural immunity .\nNina Pierpont ( MD , PhD ) cites three studies whose findings and data support her conclusions and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Centre for Disease Control \u2019 s ( CDC ) \u2018 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report \u2019 , another study published August 10th 2021 by Oxford University , and a final study published August 24th 2021 which was funded by the UK Department for Health and Social Care .\nThe CDC study focused on 469 cases among Massachusetts residents who attended indoor and outdoor public gatherings over a two week period .\nThe results found that 346 of the cases were among vaccinated residents with 74 % of them presenting with alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitalised .\nHowever the remaining 123 cases were among the unvaccinated population with just 1 person being hospitalised ( 0.8 % .\nNo deaths occurred in either group .\nThe study also found that viral loads were found to be very similar among the vaccinated and unvaccinated , meaning they were equally infectious .\nThe Oxford University study examined 900 hospital staff members in Vietnam who had been vaccinated with the Oxford / AstraZeneca viral vector injection between March and April 2021 .\nThe entire hospital staff tested negative for the Covid-19 virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first case among the vaccinated staff members was discovered on June 11th .\nAll 900 hospital staff were then retested for the Covid-19 virus and 52 additional cases were identified immediately , forcing the hospital into lockdown .\nOver the next two weeks , 16 additional cases were identified .\nThe study found that 76 % of the Covid-19 positive staff developed respiratory symptoms , with 3 staff members developing pneumonia and one staff member requiring three days of oxygen therapy .\nPeak viral loads among the fully vaccinated infected group were found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viral loads found among the staff in March \u2013 April 2020 when they were not vaccinated .\nThe UK Department of Health & Social Care study is an analysis of ongoing population wide SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in the UK and includes measures of viral load among the population .\nThe study found that viral loads among the vaccinated and unvaccinated population are virtually the same , and much higher than had been recorded prior to the Covid-19 injection roll-out .\nThe study also found that the majority of cases among the vaccinated population were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe authors of the study conclude that the Pfizer and Oxford / AstraZeneca injection have lost efficacy against what they claim to be the Delta Covid-19 variant , but they maintain that they are substantially effective at keeping people from becoming infected with the Delta variant in the rang of 67 % to 80 % .\nNine Pierpont ( MD , PhD ) rightly asks in her paper how they can conclude this when 82 % of the random sample of new positive PCR tests in the study were fully vaccinated people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of becoming infected by two-thirds ( 67 % ) , we would expect the proportion of vaccinated in the positive sample to be less than the proportion of vaccinated in the population .\nSay we start with 1000 people in the country , of whom we will randomly sample 100 .\nThe country is 80 % vaccinated .\nThis means that in our sample of 100 we have 80 vaccinated and 20 unvaccinated people .\nLet \u2019 s say that the virus has infected 10 % of the people across the sampling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If 8 of the infected are among the vaccinated , and 2 in the unvaccinated ( 80 % and 20 % of the positives , matching the ratio of vaccinated and unvaccinated in the population ) , the vaccine has made no difference in whether one can get infected ( 0 % efficacy ) .\nIf the vaccine is 67 % effective , the cases in the vaccinated group would be reduced by 2/3 to 2.67 cases , and the total cases would be only 4.67 cases ( 2.67 vaccinated and 2 unvaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 57 % of the cases would be in the vaccinated group , and 43 % in the unvaccinated .\n( We can go back to 10 % overall being positive just using ratios , yielding 5.7 cases among the vaccinated and 4.3 among the unvaccinated . )\nThis is why the proportion vaccinated in the infected sample , very close to the proportions vaccinated in the total population , are incompatible with the efficacy numbers generated by the authors .\nIt appears to me\u2014as in the Massachusetts study\u2014that the vaccine is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is in reality somewhere between slightly ( insignificantly ) decreasing susceptibility and slightly increasing susceptibility to the Delta variant .\nThe UK study is clear that viral load ( and thus infectiousness to others ) is much greater with Delta than with Alpha , and that , with Delta , viral load and infectiousness are equal in vaccinated and unvaccinated infected people.\n\u2019 The above three studies lead Nina Pierpont ( MD , PhD ) to conclude in her paper that mandating others to take a vaccine is a potentially harmful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal reason of a mandate is to protect others from infection , and these studies prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they do not do this , those who mandate the Covid-19 injections may wish to seek legal counsel regarding their culpability and liability for potential long-lasting harm to those whom they pressure into vaccination with the threat of exclusion from employment , education or society .\nSee this summary originally published at The Expose PLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM

Wuhan , China .\nThis has opened the door for a federal lawsuit filed August 30 by two active-duty service members against Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin , Homeland Security Director Xavier Bacerra and U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Janet Woodcock .\nThe Navy this week gave its sailors 90 days to get the shot and the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce their own timetables , reported Military.com .\nThe suit , filed August 30 in U.S. District Court in Colorado , seeks immediate injunctive relief .\nThe two plaintiffs , Daniel Robert , a 33-year-old drill sergeant at Fort Benning Army base in Columbus , Georgia , and Hollie Mulvihill , a 29-year-old staff sergeant at the Marine Corp base in Jacksonville , North Carolina , are asking the court for a temporary restraining order

U.S. military active-duty members who have natural immunity and do not want any of the three synthetic gene-based \u201c vaccines \u201d shot into their bodies .\nAll three injections , manufactured

the number of all the other vaccines combined since VAERS was established in 1990 .\nAccording to the lawsuit , Army Regulation 40-562 is the all-service publication that governs the administration of \u201c Immunizations and Chemoprophylaxis for the prevention of infectious diseases.\n\u201d AR 40-562 clearly states that documented survivors of an infectious disease have a \u201c presumptive

Fox News : \u201c So natural immunity , it \u2019 s very important\u2026 There are still no data to suggest vaccine immunity is better than natural immunity .\nI think both are highly protective.\n\u201d In fact , data exists that would suggest it \u2019 s the other way around \u2013 that natural immunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A recent study out of Israel showed natural immunity is

significant five-year mortality rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , with the vaccination program we have ostensibly killed more of our young active-duty people than Covid did.\n\u201d Lawyers for the plaintiffs , led by Todd Callender in Denver , stated in the lawsuit that repeated attempts to leave voicemail messages for Austin in an attempt to settle the grievance out of court have been ignored by Austin ,

mainstream media claim the COVID-19 pandemic is now \u201c a pandemic of the unvaccinated , \u201d 1 we now know this claim is based on highly misleading statistics .\nIn a July 16 , 2021 , White House press briefing,2 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Rochelle Walensky claimed that \u201c over 97 % of people who are entering the hospital right now are unvaccinated.\n\u201d A few weeks later , in an August 5 , 2021 , statement , she inadvertently revealed how that statistic actually came about.3 As it turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitalization and mortality data from January through June 2021 \u2014 a timeframe during which the vast majority of the U.S. population were still unvaccinated.4 But that \u2019 s not the case at all now .\nThe CDC is also playing with statistics in other ways to create the false and inaccurate impression that unvaccinated people make up the bulk of infections , hospitalizations and deaths .\nFor example , we now find out the agency is counting anyone who died within the first 14 days post-injection as unvaccinated .\nNot only does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it also hides the real dangers of the COVID shots , as the vast majority of deaths from these shots occur within the first two weeks.5 Now their deaths are counted as unvaccinated deaths rather than being counted as deaths due to vaccine injury or COVID-19 breakthrough infections !\nAccording to the CDC,6 you \u2019 re not counted as fully vaccinated until a full 14 days have passed since your second injection in the case of Pfizer or Moderna , or 14 days after your first dose of Janssen .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case : In other words , if you \u2019 ve received one dose of Pfizer or Moderna and develop symptomatic COVID-19 , get admitted to the hospital and/or die from COVID , you \u2019 re counted as an unvaccinated case .\nIf you \u2019 ve received two doses and get ill within 14 days , you \u2019 re still counted as an unvaccinated case .\nThe problem with this is that over 80 % of hospitalizations and deaths appear to be occurring among those who have received the jabs , but this reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined and counted .\nA really clever and common strategy of the CDC during the pandemic has been to change the definitions and goalposts so it supports their nefarious narrative .\nFor example , the CDC has quietly changed the definition of \u201c vaccine , \u201d apparently in an attempt to validate calling the COVID mRNA gene therapies vaccines .\nIn an August 26 , 2021 , archived version7 of vaccine , the CDC defines it as a \u201c product that stimulates a person \u2019 s immune system to produce immunity to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that disease.\n\u201d But a few days later , a new definition appeared on the CDC \u2019 s website,8 which now says a vaccine is a \u201c preparation that is used to stimulate the body \u2019 s immune response against diseases.\n\u201d The differences in the definitions are subtle but distinct : The first one defined a vaccine as something that will \u201c produce immunity.\n\u201d But , since the COVID-19 vaccines are not designed to stop infection but , rather , to only lessen the degree of infection , it becomes obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover the COVID vaccines .\nDifferent Testing Guidelines for Vaxxed and Unvaxxed It \u2019 s not just the CDC \u2019 s definition of a breakthrough case that skews the data .\nEven more egregious and illogical is the fact that the CDC even has two different sets of testing guidelines \u2014 one for vaccinated patients and another for the unvaccinated .\nSince the beginning of the pandemic , the CDC has recommended a PCR test cycle threshold ( CT ) of 40.9 This flies in the face of scientific consensus , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will produce 97 % false positives,10 essentially rendering the test useless.11,12,13 In mid-May 2021 , the CDC finally lowered its recommended CT count , but only for patients who have received one or more COVID shots.14 So , if you have received a COVID injection , the CDC \u2019 s guidelines call for your PCR test to be run at a CT of 28 or less .\nIf you are unvaccinated , your PCR test is to be run at a CT of 40 , which grossly overestimates the true prevalence of infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals who get tested are FAR more prone to get false positives , while those who have received the jab are more likely to get an accurate diagnosis of infection .\nOnly Hospitalization and Death Count if You \u2019 re COVID Jabbed Even that \u2019 s not all .\nThe CDC also hides vaccine failures and props up the \u201c pandemic of the unvaccinated \u201d narrative by only counting breakthrough cases that result in hospitalization or death .\nIn other words , if you got your second COVID shot more than 14 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not count as a breakthrough case unless you \u2019 re admitted to the hospital and/or die from COVID-19 in the hospital , even if you test positive .\nSo , to summarize , COVID breakthrough cases count only if all of the following apply : \u2022 The patient received the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna shot at least 14 days ago ( or one dose in case of Johnson & Johnson \u2019 s single-dose injection ) \u2022 The patient tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 using a CT of 28 or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient is admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 and/or dies in the hospital Vaccinated Probably Make Up Bulk of Hospitalizations If vaccinated and unvaccinated were not treated with such varying standards , we \u2019 d probably find that the vaccinated now make up the bulk of hospitalizations , making the COVID pandemic one of the vaccinated .\nAn August 30 , 2021 , expos\u00e9 by The Epoch Times reveals what \u2019 s really happening on the front lines:15 The heart of the problem is that the U.S. is not even trying to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Epoch Times , \u201c the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have publicly acknowledged that they do not have accurate data.\n\u201d So , when you hear that cases are rising , and that most of them are unvaccinated , you need to ask : \u201c Are these people who have had one vaccine and gotten sick , two vaccines and gotten sick , or no vaccines at all ?\nWithout more details , it is impossible to know what is really going on , \u201d The Epoch Times says.16 All we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who spoke with The Epoch Times , is \u201c the vaccines are not as effective as public health officials told us they would be .\n\u2018 This is a product that \u2019 s not doing what it \u2019 s supposed to do .\nIt \u2019 s supposed to stop transmission of this virus and it \u2019 s not doing that.\n\u2019 \u201d On top of all of that , hospitals are still also reporting non-COVID related illnesses

available and effective treatments like Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine ?\nBy now , the answer should be clear : because the availability of cheap and effective early treatment therapeutics and at-home treatments effectively nullifies the basis for an emergency use authorisation of the experimental COVID-19 vaccines .\nIn other words , the imperative being pushed by governments \u2013 that \u201c there is no other alternative \u201d to vaccines \u2013 relies on no cheap and effective treatments being made widely available to the public .\nThis is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between government regulators , the pharmaceutical cartel and mainstream media .\nAustralian political leaders are among the most aggressive in the world in their race to \u201c double jab \u201d their population with the experimental corporate \u2018 vaccine \u2019 products .\nSo it \u2019 s no surprise that their drug regulation agency is now determined to shutdown any access to cheap and effective therapeutics like Ivermectin .\nSeptember 10 , 2021 , was a black day , the day a group of faceless bureaucrats known as the \u201c Advisory Committee for Medicines Scheduling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA ) , compromised medical practise and the health of their fellow Australians .\nThe TGA used its regulatory muscle to prevent doctors at the COVID-19 pandemic \u2019 s coalface from prescribing ivermectin ( IVM ) , the one therapy available that is safe , cheap and which reduces mortality in the order of 60 per cent .\nThis poorly conceived action threatens the high standards of medical practise we have achieved in Australia , and the credibility of the administrative structure within which medicine operates .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients contracting COVID-19 are left to hear , \u201c Sorry , no treatment for COVID-19 is legally available .\nJust go to hospital when you get very sick.\n\u201d In the longer term it means that bureaucrats can change the way medicine is practised for whatever reason without review by , or discussion with , the medical community .\nIt is important for Australians to consider two issues that follow the TGA \u2019 s decision : first , it adds risk to those exposed to COVID-19 , putting additional pressures on health-care facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fault lines that have appeared in medical practise during the course of the COVID-19 saga .\nLooking at the first issue , the decision by the TGA to prevent general practitioners from prescribing IVM to manage COVID-19 , the Notice is flawed and misleading , although giving clues to its political motivation .\nThe evidence that IVM is safe and effective in both preventing and treating early ( pre-hospital ) COVID-19 is overwhelming , as has been laid out in four Quadrant articles published through 2021 .\nDespite this evidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IVM \u2019 s use and to do so in unprecedented fashion .\nThe causes for the suppression include political agendas , pressures from pharmaceutical companies , ideology and breakdown in medical communication .\nThis latest blow by the TGA follows its previous form in shutting down use of hydroxychloroquine , another safe , effective and cheap COVID-19 therapy .\nEvery experienced doctor prescribes drugs for \u201c off-label \u201d indications .\nIt is anathema and dangerous that the doctor-patient relationship can now be over-ridden by government agendas .\nThe driving source of \u201c evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Cochrane Review , which concluded from a single meta-analysis that the benefit in treating COVID-19 was \u201c unproven \u201d .\nThis was out of line with a series of supportive meta-analyses by non-conflicted competent epidemiologists .\nYet results from Cochrane have singularly been adopted without criticism or discussion , initially by the National COVID Clinical Evidence Taskforce ( NCCET ) , then by diffusion via various professional and regulatory bodies while being fanned by an even less critical mainstream press .\nThus IVM is seen by many , including some medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age .\nWhat is not discussed is the validity of the Cochrane Review and the advisory messages from the NCCET .\nThe influence of vested interest parties on Cochrane has been previously raised .\nThe circumstances of generating the review by an unknown German group when experienced epidemiologists were available needs explanation .\nMore immediately , critiques of the Cochrane analysis and the NCCET by unaligned British epidemiologists show defective methodology , cherry-picked data and exclusion of a raft of supportive data .\nThe information source used to formulate policy in Australia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 60 controlled clinical trials and the positive experience recorded when IVM was used in national and regional programmes .\nCochrane is an incomplete and unreliable basis for decision making on COVID-19 management in an Australian context .\nThe views of international experts are trumped by unknown local bureaucrats .\nSurprisingly , the reasons given by the TGA for their decision on IVM are not the usual mantra of \u201c unproven \u201d , based on Cochrane , although that is left hanging as a \u201c given \u201d .\nThe reasons are even less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d ( incorrect , but this nevertheless demonstrates there is a need for the drug ) ; \u201c concerns re toxicity due to dosage determined by social media \u201d ( this concern is easily remedied by controlling usage through front-line doctors ) , and , lastly , the real reason : \u201c It may interfere with the vaccination programme \u201d .\nWhat an extraordinary statement !\nThe reason for \u201c vaccine hesitancy \u201d has nothing to do with IVM use .\nDoctors promote IVM as complementing the vaccine programme , which , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain of the virus and waning of post-vaccine immunity , makes early drug treatment more needed than ever .\nIt is irresponsible to exclude IVM as a drug to control high numbers of infections that will be encountered as Australia moves out of its \u201c bubble \u201d , irrespective of the level of vaccination .\nThe only parts of the world not experiencing a \u201c third wave \u201d of infection are those where lockdowns have been avoided , such as Sweden , or where IVM is used throughout the community , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @

to see some of the more common side effects emerging .\nMyocarditis , or inflammation of the heart muscle , is among them .\nThis condition can cause symptoms similar to a heart attack , including chest pain , shortness of breath , abnormal heartbeat and fatigue.1 A large study from Israel2 revealed that the Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA jab is associated with a threefold increased risk of myocarditis,3 leading to the condition at a rate of one to five excess events per 100,000 persons.4 Other elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jab , including lymphadenopathy ( swollen lymph nodes ) , appendicitis and herpes

severe cases , myocarditis can cause permanent damage to the heart muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , stroke and sudden cardiac death.8 In August 2021 , New Zealand reported the death of a woman following Pfizer \u2019 s COVID-19 jab , which they believe was due to vaccine-induced myocarditis.9 The death prompted the Ministry of Health to issue a statement to ensure \u201c health care professionals and consumers remain vigilant and are aware of the signs of myocarditis and pericarditis \u201d following the jab.10 A number of studies have now found a connection between COVID-19 jabs and myocarditis .\nIn a September-October 2021 case report with literature review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcomes of this case scenario confirm myocarditis as a probable complication of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\u201d 11 Another study from Israel detailed myocarditis following Pfizer \u2019 s COVID-19 jab in six male patients with a median age of 23 years.12 A similar study published in Pediatrics13 reported seven cases of acute myocarditis or myopericarditis in otherwise healthy adolescent males .\nEach had experienced chest pain within four days of receiving the second dose of Pfizer \u2019 s COVID-19 jab .\nData published in JAMA Cardiology14 by physicians from the Navy , Army and Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myocarditis in U.S. military personnel who received a COVID-19 jab .\nDr. Charles Hoffe , a family physician from Lytton , British Columbia , told health officials that his patients were suffering adverse effects from the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines , including myocarditis.15 About his young , male patients , Hoffe explained , \u201c They have permanently damaged hearts.\n\u201d :16 Officials Advise Against Vaccination of 12- to 15-Year-Olds Due to the risk of myocarditis , Britain \u2019 s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization ( JCVI ) recommended against COVID-9 injections for healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finn told Reuters:17 In the U.S. , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) is

Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) since April 2021.18 According to the CDC:19 Despite the risk , the CDC is still advising children aged 12 and older to get the jab , and August 23 ,

aged 16 and older.23,24 Half of them got the shots and half initially received a placebo .\nHowever , in the second week of December 2020 , Pfizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of controls opted to get the real injection rather than remain in the control group for the remainder of the trial , which is slated to continue for another two years .\nIn their prescribing information , the risk of heart inflammation is acknowledged .\nAs reported by STAT News:25 Further , in its approval letter for Comirnaty , the FDA orders Pfizer to conduct research to investigate the risk of inflammation in and around the heart , as voluntary reporting mechanisms are insufficient.26 The FDA accepted Pfizer \u2019 s suggested timetable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart and heart sack inflammation , which includes the submission of an interim report at the end of October 2023 , a study completion date of June 30 , 2025 , and submission of a final report October 31 , 2025 .\nSpike Protein in the Jab Is Inflammatory Dr. Robert Malone , the inventor of the mRNA and DNA vaccine core platform technology,27 has been bravely warning of the dangers of COVID-19 jabs , in part due to the spike protein they contain .\nIn its native form in SARS-CoV-2 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the viral infection , and in its wild form it \u2019 s known to open the blood-brain barrier , cause cell damage ( cytotoxicity ) and , Malone said , \u201c is active in manipulating the biology of the cells that coat the inside of your blood vessels \u2014 vascular endothelial cells , in part through its interaction with ACE2 , which controls contraction in the blood vessels , blood pressure and other things.\n\u201d 28 Malone is well aware of the actions of spike protein , as he worked to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action of the COX-2 enzyme , which is a key inflammatory enzyme .\nIn one of his papers , he laid out how the spike protein and another protein in the virus directly turn on COX-2 promoter in infected cells .\nThis awareness of the spike protein as a biologically active protein made him alert the FDA in fall 2020 about the associated risks .\nHis FDA colleagues transferred his concerns to the FDA \u2019 s review branch , which dismissed his concerns , saying they did not believe the spike protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t enough documentation otherwise .\nAs history now reveals , they proceeded with the EUA .\nIt \u2019 s since been revealed , however , that the spike protein on its own is enough to cause inflammation and damage to the vascular system , even independent of a virus.29 Blood clots are another serious concern related to the spike protein .\nAccording to Hoffe:30 \u201c [ It ] becomes part of the cell wall of your vascular endothelium , which means that these cells , which line your blood vessels , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood flows smoothly now have these little spiky bits sticking out .\nSo it is absolutely inevitable that blood clots will form , because your blood platelets circulate around in your vessels and the purpose of blood platelets is to detect a damaged vessel and block that damage when it starts bleeding .\nSo when a platelet comes through a capillary and suddenly hits all these covid spikes that are jutting into the inside vessel \u2026 blood clots will form to block that vessel .\nThat \u2019 s how platelets work.\n\u201d Hoffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his patients within four to seven days of them receiving a COVID-19 injection and found that 62 % have evidence of clotting.31 Because of the risk of the formation of blood clots in your vessels , Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi,32 a retired professor , microbiologist and infectious disease and immunology specialist who , along with several other doctors and scientists , formed Doctors for COVID Ethics , went so far as to say that giving the COVID-19 injection to children is a crime : \u201c Do not give it to children because they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you give it to your child you are committing a crime.\n\u201d As mentioned , due to myocarditis risks in youth , Great Britain \u2019 s JCVI is also taking a precautionary approach for COVID-19 injections among 12- to 15-year-olds .\nWei Shen Lim , COVID-19 chair for JCVI , stated , \u201c The margin of benefit is considered too small to support universal Covid-19 vaccination for this age group at this time.\n\u201d 33 Since the publication of

China", "content": "The announcement of \u201c AUKUS , \u201d the Australian-UK-US \u201c defense alliance , \u201d predictably overwhelmed headlines and commentary and not because the world was letting out a collective sigh of relief over assurances by AUKUS that peace and stability was finally coming to the Indo-Pacific region , but because of the exact opposite .\nDespite claims that the alliance sought to underwrite security in the Indo-Pacific region and although no specific nation was mentioned as the ultimate target of AUKUS , neither the Western media nor China \u2013 the nation quite clearly being targeted \u2013 perceived it that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Guardian in its article , \u201c Alliance with Australia and US a \u2018 downpayment on Global Britain \u2019 , \u201d would explicitly state ( emphasis added ) : Chinese state media , Global Times , made it abundantly clear that China understood AUKUS was aimed directly at it , with one early headline stating , \u201c AUKUS another hostile signal to China , worsens Asia-Pacific security.\n\u201d As for the region AUKUS claims it exists to protect and promote security for , few voices spoke up positively in favor of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent article reported that the Indonesian and Malaysian governments both feared the move would trigger an escalation and perhaps even an arms race .\nThe article stated : [ Malaysian Prime Minister ] Ismail Sabri told Morrison he was concerned AUKUS could provoke other powers to act more aggressively in the region .\nIndonesia earlier said it was \u201c deeply concerned over the continuing arms race and power projection in the region \u201d , and called on Australia to meet its nuclear non-proliferation obligations and to uphold the rule of law as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Law of the Sea 1982 , or UNCLOS .\nVeteran Malaysian politician Dr. Mahathir Mohamad was interviewed by The Australian Financial Review in an article titled , \u201c \u2018 You have escalated the threat \u2019 : Mahathir blasts Australia on subs.\n\u201d The article would report : \u201c This agreement indicates you openly regard China as a possible enemy and that , if it comes to the crunch , you might even go to war .\nJust imagine what war would do to south-east Asia , \u201d Dr Mahathir said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ region AUKUS claims it exists to protect all seem to agree , AUKUS \u2019 formation was a provocation and will further undermine , not uphold peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region .\nAnd while all of this is very clear , there is another aspect to the alliance \u2019 s announcement that is being severely underreported .\nAUKUS is merely a political move made to reflect the collective military and economic preparations underway for a limited conflict with China .\nNuclear-Powered Submarines for Australia : At What Cost ?\nAt the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were plans to provide Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines .\nAustralia currently operates 6 Collins-class diesel electric submarines delivered between the late 1990 \u2019 s and early 2000 \u2019 s .\nWith the US and China operating nearly the same number of submarines ( approximately 70 each ) and with the UK possessing 11 more , it is perhaps hoped Australia \u2019 s submarine fleet might help maintain a balance or even perhaps provide an edge to the West in the Indo-Pacific region .\nThe deal also entails the use of Australia as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consist of Astute-class attack submarines as well as nuclear-armed Vanguard-class submarines , according to the UK Times .\nNo doubt , this will be hailed in Westminster as an example of \u201c Global Britain \u201d flexing its military might internationally .\nHowever , from a purely strategic point of view , the use of Australia as a base would most likely be confined to attack submarines armed with conventional weapons but could easily be used to support nuclear-armed submarines at a moment \u2019 s notice .\nSuch prospects clearly demonstrate why other nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provocation and escalation .\nThe aforementioned Guardian article also noted that Rolls Royce and BAE Systems would likely win contracts as part of this deal .\nConsidering the 18 month period the Guardian reported would be used to plan out the details and the several years it takes for BAE Systems to build and commission nuclear-powered submarines , then Australia may not put these new submarines into service until the 2030 \u2019 s .\nBut the submarine deal comes at a cost .\nThe new deal is likely to result in a $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through .\nIt will not be the first time Washington has undermined and dashed lucrative defense deals for Paris .\nIn 2015 France found itself reimbursing Russia for two Mistral-class amphibious assault ships it failed to deliver after Paris was pressured by Washington to cancel the deal .\nThis was amid another campaign of propaganda and encroachment \u2013 not on China \u2013 but instead on Russia amid instability and conflict in neighboring Ukraine .\nFrance , an eager accomplice in Washington \u2019 s various wars of aggression since the turn of the century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving end of American exceptionalism multiple times .\nFrance \u2019 s misfortunes today will most certainly be Australia \u2019 s tomorrow as the AUKUS alliance runs its course .\nIn terms of trade and economics , Australia has already begun paying its own price for its obedience to Washington .\nAustralia \u2019 s largest trade partner in 2019 was China .\nAustralian exports to China outmatched all Australian exports to North America and Europe combined .\nAustralia \u2019 s participation in a US-led propaganda campaign pressuring China across a range of fabricated accusations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegations of an alleged \u201c Uyghur genocide \u201d in China \u2019 s western Xinjiang region , and supposed \u201c bullying \u201d in the South China Sea , led to Chinese-Australian trade dropping off significantly , with ABC Australia itself claiming by as much as 40 % .\nWhile Australia boasts it has compensated for these losses by expanding into alternative markets , such effort could have been used to instead double Australian trade rather than merely recover from the politically-motivated , self-inflicted economic damage caused by its provocations and posturing toward China .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ only going to further ensure trade with China continues to drop off , hurting farmers , miners , and other key industries within Australia \u2019 s economy .\nThe beneficiaries will be Western defense contractors , mainly in the US and UK \u2013 who are without coincidence also the sponsors of think-tanks and media conglomerates pushing the anti-China propaganda used to justify Australia \u2019 s growing row with Beijing .\nWhat is Being Used to Justify AUKUS ?\nWhile AUKUS was announced without singling out any specific nation , the Western media was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary threat AUKUS was supposedly created to counter .\nIn a CNN segment featuring retired US Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton , when asked what had prompted the US , UK , and Australia to \u201c reassert \u201d defense ties and \u201c push back \u201d against Chinese \u201c aggressions , \u201d Colonel Leighton would cite the South China Sea , claiming : What you have is an area that \u2019 s been claimed by China , by the People \u2019 s Republic of China for really since they took over mainland China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those claims are , are based on natural resources or perceived natural resources in those areas .\nSo it \u2019 s between Vietnam , the Philippines , Brunei , Malaysia , of course , China and Taiwan .\nSo that \u2019 s the first part of it .\nSo what we \u2019 re talking about here is making sure that what we call the sea lanes of communication are open .\nSo , what does that mean ?\nThat means that the trade routes that we use on the open seas need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australian , and UK view , they need to be protected by our collective forces in order to make sure that no other navy can interfere with the trade routes as they exist right now .\nSo , that means any oil , for example , it comes from the Middle East , any raw materials that come from Africa , things that China depends on a great deal\u2026 Before Colonel Leighton could finish what was quickly becoming a paradoxical statement in which he was suggesting AUKUS was to protect China \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was asked if China had been impeding trade along these supposedly threatened routes .\nThe ultimate irony of suggesting AUKUS would \u201c protect \u201d shipping lanes in the South China Sea is highlighted by the fact that the US and its allies are really the primary threat to international commerce around the globe .\nThe US and its allies regularly impose unilateral sanctions on nations and through a combination of physical force and legal threats , seizing ships and their cargo , effectively strangling free trade over the open seas .\nNations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piracy include Venezuela , Iran , Cuba , and Syria .\nUndoubtedly , AUKUS is clearly poised to add China to that list .\nRevealed by Colonel Leighton \u2019 s comments is an all but openly admitted fact that AUKUS and other alliances before it , are merely iterations of a long-standing US-led strategy of containment of China .\nAUKUS in particular is meant to threaten and possibly disrupt shipping lanes China above all other nations depends on , not \u201c protect \u201d them .\nThe US State Department \u2019 s Office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its official website titled , \u201c 189 .\nDraft Memorandum From Secretary of Defense McNamara to President Johnson , \u201d dated 1965 , stated ( emphasis added ) : The 1965 memorandum reflects a similar narrative that has prevailed in one way or another for the next several decades with its most recent iteration taking the form of a US-led \u201c international rules-based order \u201d the US must preserve against \u201c revisionist \u201d states like Russia and China .\nThe same document would also note : It is very obvious these three fronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US .\nThe US currently has tens of thousands of US troops stationed along the Japan-Korea front with Washington citing the threat of North Korea as justification for the installation of THAAD missile defense systems clearly meant to defend US installations from a Chinese retaliation , not a North Korean attack .\nRegarding the India-Pakistan front , the US has most recently included India in another attempted anti-China front \u2013 the so-called Quad Alliance .\nThe US has also armed and backed separatist militants in Pakistan \u2019 s southwest region of Baluchistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese-led infrastructure projects that form the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) .\nThis year alone there have been several high-profile , deadly attacks against Chinese engineers and even an assassination attempt targeting China \u2019 s ambassador to Pakistan in Baluchistan \u2013 all aimed at disrupting China \u2019 s Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) .\nThe Southeast Asian front today consists of an arc of instability created by US-backed anti-Chinese opposition groups trying to seize power in respective Southeast Asian states .\nDubbed the \u201c Milk Tea Alliance , \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their US government funding funnelled through the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) and adjacent corporate-funded foundations including Open Society .\nIn addition to this arc of instability , the US has been busy cultivating tensions in the South China Sea where the US accuses China of \u201c bullying \u201d other nations by making \u201c excessive \u201d maritime claims .\nTo counter this \u201c bullying , \u201d the US regularly conducts \u201c Freedom of Navigation Operations \u201d ( FNOPs ) in which it sails US Navy warships through waters claimed by China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement titled , \u201c 7th Fleet conducts Freedom of Navigation Operation \u201d ( July 12 , 2021 ) , for example , would claim : Not mentioned is the fact that the US itself is not actually a signatory of the 1982 Law of the Sea of Conventions and is in fact one of only a few nations not to sign it .\nThe US Navy also makes another telling admission when it claimed : \u201c China , Taiwan , and Vietnam each claim sovereignty over the Paracel Islands.\n\u201d According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website , it is not China \u201c bullying \u201d nations in the region over the South China Sea , but rather a series of overlapping claims .\nNations in the region have disputes not only with China , but also with each other as revealed in headlines like the Wall Street Journal \u2019 s 2016 article , \u201c Indonesia Blows Up 23 Foreign Fishing Boats to Send a Message , \u201d in which the Indonesian government destroyed captured Malaysian and Vietnamese fishing boats , or an article from Vietnamese news portal Binh Duong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing boats , \u201d or Bangkok Post \u2019 s article , \u201c 3 Malaysian trawlers seized near Satun.\n\u201d It is abundantly clear that the South China Sea hosts a multitude of overlapping claims and disputes which result in sometimes theatrical posturing \u2013 not just between China and other states in the region , but between these other claimants as well .\nThese disputes never approach becoming an actual conflict and are almost always resolved bilaterally .\nSimilar disputes take place everywhere else in the world , including in Europe , where just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mobilization of British and French warships over contested fishing waters near Jersey island .\nDespite the theatrical mobilization of military vessels , this row too was resolved peacefully .\nLikewise , in their incessant bid to maintain tensions between Ukraine , Russia and Europe , the US and UK have been involved in a series of blatant provocations over the last few years in the Black Sea which temporarily disrupt sea lanes .\nIt is clear the US is inserting itself into otherwise ordinary and long-standing disputes in the South China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and growing naval presence in the region and to recruit nations into belligerent alliances precisely like the Quad and AUKUS .\nThe idea is to escalate ordinary disputes into a regional or global conflict to help advance US foreign policy and in this case , encircle and contain China .\nThe extensive propaganda campaign the US is engaged in to achieve this goal is underpinned by moves such as a tribunal it organized at the Permanent Court of Arbitration ( PCA ) at the Hague , the Netherlands in 2016 \u2013 allegedly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American lawyer Paul Reichler and the Western law firm Foley Hoag \u2013 not Filipino lawyers \u2013 who led the effort .\nThe non-binding politically-motivated ruling was never capitalized on by the Philippines who opted instead for bilateral talks with Beijing , establishing a mechanism to ease tensions in the South China Sea and even cooperate together , according to the Philippines \u2019 own Department of Foreign Affairs website .\nIronically , after the PCA \u2019 s 2016 ruling , not only did Beijing reject it , Taiwan did too .\nAccording to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also then sent a patrol ship to the contested waters .\nRarely mentioned is that Taiwan \u2019 s claims over the South China Sea are almost identical to mainland China \u2019 s .\nAn article from Taipei Times titled , \u201c Tsai to avoid \u2018 U-shaped line \u2019 : source , \u201d admits : The U-shaped line \u2014 also known as the \u201c 11-dash line \u201d \u2014 was featured in the \u201c Location Map of the South China Sea Islands \u201d drawn up by the Republic of China ( ROC ) government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( KMT ) lost the Chinese Civil War and fled to Taiwan , the Chinese Communist Party changed it to a \u201c nine-dash line.\n\u201d Washington \u2019 s silence over Taiwan \u2019 s identical claims amid a simultaneous propaganda campaign to depict China as the sole \u201c bully \u201d of the South China Sea punches further holes in AUKUS \u2019 pretext for existence .\nTaiwan , where the current US-backed ruling government in Taipei continues to inch toward independence \u2013 is in fact \u2013 another pressure point being used by Washington against Beijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is recognized by virtually all nations ( including the United States itself ) as part of China under the \u201c One China \u201d policy .\nTo illustrate this , the US itself does not have an official embassy in Taipei .\nBut while the US officially recognizes Taiwan \u2019 s status under international law , it has unofficially and consistently undermined it by supporting pro-independence political groups in Taiwan and incrementally building up Taiwan \u2019 s military vis-a-vis the mainland .\nTogether with the South China Sea issue , these two pressure points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a constant investment in US-driven political pressure and propaganda as well as a steady stream of military provocations including the recent announcement of AUKUS and vows to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines .\nThese pressure points are cultivated specifically to pressure China , to isolate and contain the rising nation , and to grant the US an extension to what it itself calls its \u201c primacy \u201d over Asia .\nThe resulting tensions are used by Washington to cobble together \u201c alliances \u201d to escalate tensions further and eventually provoke conflict .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ US policymakers have extensively worked out the details of such a conflict and have concluded it would benefit the US .\nA 2016 RAND Corporation paper ( PDF ) commissioned by the US Army and titled , \u201c War with China : Thinking Through the Unthinkable , \u201d presents a compelling argument for the preservation of American hegemony through a limited conventional war confined to East Asia .\nIt \u2019 s worth emphasizing that US planners admit that China \u2019 s forces are confined to Chinese territory .\nThey also admit all \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located near the Chinese mainland , e.g .\nthe South China Sea and Taiwan .\nThe paper notes that the time frame studied stretched from 2015 to 2025 , representing a closing window of opportunity where the US and its allies could still potentially fight and benefit from a limited conflict with China .\nBeyond 2025 , these chances diminish and eventually China will irreversibly surpass the US economically and militarily , with any conflict fought thereafter against China done so at the expense of the US .\nThe paper describes the obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the US provoking a limited conflict with China .\nIt states ( emphasis added ) : The US is clearly preparing the grounds for this conflict , cultivating the very \u201c separatists \u201d the paper notes the conflict would \u201c embolden , \u201d while attacking and attempting to block China \u2019 s BRI which is currently diversifying away from China \u2019 s dependency on vulnerable Asia-Pacific maritime trade routes .\nAlready mentioned were US-backed separatists in Baluchistan , Pakistan attacking CPEC .\nCPEC is designed to move hydrocarbons travelling from the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in southwest Pakistan into China , circumventing the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea where AUKUS would seek to contain and constrict Chinese commerce during any potential conflict .\nIn addition to this , Washington \u2019 s and the western mainstream media \u2019 s continued obsession with China \u2019 s western region of Xinjiang also \u201c coincidentally \u201d overlaps a crucial juncture of China \u2019 s BRI .\nA similar BRI project was created in Myanmar to move hydrocarbons across the Southeast Asian country into Kunming , China , circumventing the Malacca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have \u2013 this year \u2013 carried out attacks on security forces protecting the pipeline moving these hydrocarbons overland into China .\nThe Irrawaddy , a US NED-funded media platform focused on Myanmar , in an article titled , \u201c Deadly Attack on Pipeline Station Spotlights China \u2019 s High Stakes in Myanmar , \u201d helps illustrate the multitude of ways the US is directly and indirectly preparing the ground for conflict with China by preventing Beijing from resolving vulnerabilities the US seeks to exploit during such a conflict .\nMore directly , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to construct a network of missiles along the first island chain which includes Japan , Taiwan , the Philippines , and Indonesia .\nThe US State Department \u2019 s Radio Free Asia in an article titled , \u201c U.S .\nIndo-Pacific Command Proposes New Missile Capabilities to Deter China , \u201d would report : The assessment calls for \u201c the fielding of an Integrated Joint Force with precision-strike networks \u201d along the so-called first island chain \u2014 referring to missile strike capabilities \u2014 and integrated air missile defense in the second island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document also calls for \u201c a distributed force posture that provides the ability to preserve stability , and if needed , dispense and sustain combat operations for extended periods.\n\u201d Clearly , the US creating rings of military installations around China , thousands of miles from America \u2019 s own shores , seeks precisely the opposite of maintaining stability and instead , is solely intended to help \u201c dispense and sustain combat operations for extended periods , \u201d as per plans drawn up within the pages of the 2016 RAND paper .\nWashington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d from China could , in the context of a coming war the US is preparing with China , be interpreted instead as tying off a limb before amputation rather than any sort of serious effort to establish a healthy , sustainable , self-sufficient US economy .\nAUKUS \u2019 announcement is very clearly a political \u201c capstone \u201d of these combined military and economic preparations for a limited conflict the US seeks to provoke with China either in the South China Sea or over Taiwan , or any of the other many flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressuring China over .\nThe goal is not to militarily defeat China but to instead set it back economically by decades , creating the possible conditions for internal instability the US can exploit toward regime change .\nThe US , representing only 4 % of the global population , yet presuming dominion over the entire planet as self-proclaimed leader of an \u201c international rules-based order , \u201d can only achieve and maintain primacy by artificially arresting development of nations around the globe , and knocking them down militarily when they overcome these artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented for the US to provoke an armed conflict directly with a peer competitor like China , China \u2019 s otherwise inevitable surpassing of the US is also unprecedented , inviting unpredictable , dangerous , and likewise unprecedented methods by Washington to approach and attempt to delay or deny China \u2019 s rise .\nThe status quo all but guarantees China \u2019 s economy along with its military and political influence will irreversibly surpass the US \u2019 within a decade .\nThe closing window of opportunity the US has to prevent China \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise and the unprecedented transfer of primacy from West to East is almost certainly the impetus behind the announcement of \u201c AUKUS \u201d and all the ground preparations that preceded it .\nTime will tell whether China , the rest of Asia , and indeed the rest of the world , will escape the perpetual conflict trap which the US continually lays , and whether multi-polarism will continue to emerge and become the dominant paradigm of geopolitics going forward , or if the US will manage to artificially maintain its unipolar order for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unprecedented death and destruction in East Asia and possibly beyond .\n*** Author Brian Berletic , formerly known under his pen name

driven by inconsistent statements from the same experts during a single interview .\nIt is important to seek out verifiable news and independent research The two identified culprits behind misunderstanding the basic facts were information on social media and partisan bias ; yet , since social media posts are highly censored , it isn \u2019 t likely \u201c misinformation \u201d that is driving misunderstandings Evidence suggests the number who misunderstand the risks from COVID-19 have not demonstrably changed in the past seven months ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poll , from 40 % to 53.2 % believe the infection is a broad risk for the population Data from a poll done six months after the start of the pandemic were called \u201c nothing short of stunning \u201d as they revealed dramatic misunderstandings of the risk of dying from COVID-19 , which \u201c sadly , comes as no surprise \u201d Knowledge gives you the power to make informed decisions based on evidence .\nA bank will not

misconceptions , misinformation and sometimes outright lies .\nA report1 released in 2020 , six months into the pandemic , revealed that most Americans had significant misconceptions of the risks involved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much has changed .\nSix months after the start of the pandemic , investment management organization Franklin Templeton Investments , in collaboration with Gallup,2 released a report about Americans \u2019 understanding of the COVID-19 infection .\nThe research focused on fundamental and undisputed facts of the risk for individuals and did not address any information that might be seen as controversial , such as treatment options and lockdown policies .\nIn the report , the firm wrote:3 The Franklin Templeton-Gallup Economics of Recovery Study of Americans found there were misconceptions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection .\nThe analysts then separated the beliefs and compared those to the actual data .\nThis is from the report:4 \u2022 On average , Americans believe that people aged 55 and older account for just over half of total COVID-19 deaths ; the actual figure is 92 % .\n\u2022 Americans believe that people aged 44 and younger account for about 30 % of total deaths ; the actual figure is 2.7 % .\n\u2022 Americans overestimate the risk of death from COVID-19 for people aged 24 and younger by a factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk for people aged 65 and older is half of what it actually is ( 40 % vs 80 % ) .\nWhen the data were broken down by age groups they found that most people under age 65 really had no concept of the actual number of deaths for their age group:5 Writing in Wirepoints,6 Mark Glennon commented on the findings saying , \u201c The only good news there is that folks 65 and older are much more aware of the heightened risk for their own age group.\n\u201d 7 The report8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstanding of basic facts from a COVID-19 infection .\nThose culprits were misinformation predominantly shared on social media and the partisan bias for Democrats to \u201c mistakenly overstate the risk of death from COVID-19 for younger people.\n\u201d Templeton \u2019 s chief investment officer Sonal Desai , Ph.D. , commented:9 The data for the Templeton-Gallup study were gathered between July 2 , 2020 , and July 14 , 2020 , and were based on a sample size of 10,014 U.S. adults.10 As disturbing as these misperceptions reported in the news and shared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first six months of the pandemic , later evidence suggests not too much has changed .\nFebruary 10 , 2021 , CNN reported11 that 25 % of the people surveyed thought there was a small risk to returning to prepandemic levels of activity and 66 % reported there was a large or moderate risk .\nThe poll was taken between February 5 , 2021 , and February 8 , 2021 , and \u201c based on a nationally representative sample of 1,030 people age 18 and older.\n\u201d 12 From this small sample , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to view COVID-19 as a risk were people aged 18 to 29 .\nHowever , the percentage of individuals in this age group was nearly equal to that found in the Templeton-Gallup Study done seven months earlier.13 In the Templeton-Gallup Study,14 59.1 % of 18-to-24-year olds were worried about serious side effects , while in the CNN poll,15 58 % of 18- to 29-year-olds were worried about serious side effects .\nYet , the percent of death in that age group is also nearly identical : 0.1 % in July 202016 and 0.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified in the Templeton-Gallup Study can also be found in vaccination rates around the country .\nIn other words , Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be fully vaccinated.18 This follows along with data found in the CNN poll,19 which revealed that 76 % of the people who had been vaccinated continue to see COVID-19 as a high risk .\nBased on the percentage of individuals who are vaccinated in the U.S. , there continues to be nearly a majority of Americans who are operating under the misconception that the infection has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAccording to Mayo Clinic \u2019 s COVID-19 tracker20 approximately 52.7 % of adults in the U.S. were fully vaccinated on August 31 , 2021 .\nThe Washington Post21 reported August 2 , 2021 , that 70 % of adults had received at least one shot .\nExtrapolating this information , if 76 % of those who are vaccinated believe that COVID is a broad risk for the population , this means from 40 % to 53.2 % of the country continues to hold this belief .\nFrom the small CNN22 sample , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about serious side effects across a broad age range may not have dropped significantly since the first six months of the pandemic , and 18 months later people continue to operate under misconceptions .\nThose Who Didn \u2019 t Take the Jab Think It Is the Greater Risk Another published poll by23 conducted from July 15 , 2021 , to July 27 , 2021 , found that 67 % of adults have received the COVID vaccine and 3 % say they will get it as soon as they can .\nThis number has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June 2021.24 Of those who responded , 10 % want to \u201c wait and see \u201d how the vaccine performs and 14 % say they will \u201c definitely not \u201d get a vaccine .\nThis number has also remained relatively steady since December 2020 .\nA fourth poll25 found that vaccinated individuals are nearly twice as likely to worry about the new COVID variants over those who were unvaccinated .\nAdditionally , the same poll shows that many of the unvaccinated adults believe the shot is a bigger risk than the infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of vaccinated adults that believe the infection is a larger risk than the vaccine .\nThe majority of unvaccinated adults believe that the news media have \u201c generally exaggerated \u201d the seriousness of the pandemic , which is likely the result of publishing broad data without accurately representing the number of individuals who are seriously ill or who have died .\nPresident Biden is quoted in The Washington Post26 reiterating the same data from health experts in the U.S. Biden said:27 \u201c If you \u2019 re unvaccinated , you are much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; two , get hospitalized ; and , three , die if you get it .\nThis is a tragedy.\n\u201d However , this is opposite of data from other reporting countries such as Israel and Scotland , where half or more of those hospitalized in August and September 2021 were vaccinated.28,29,30,31 When misinformation is being spread from the top down , it \u2019 s easy to understand how Americans continue to believe the infection is killing equal numbers in each age group .\nWhile any death from this infection is one death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from heart disease , lung cancer , car accidents and drownings .\nYet , people have not stopped eating poorly , smoking , driving cars and swimming .\nNor has the government mandated these activities stop .\nIf the Pandemic Is so Bad , Why Censor Social Media ?\nThe debate over social media censorship is raging.32,33,34 At no time in history could you imagine that people would support censoring ideas in a country built on freedom of speech.35 Your rights to free speech and \u201c peaceably to assemble , and to petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d 36 are your First Amendment rights .\nAnd yet , some news media and opinion writers have long lists of utopian-like advantages to censorship that include:37,38,39 The issue with these purported advantages is that someone must be responsible for determining what should be censored , what is false information and in what direction public opinion should be influenced \u2014 not to mention how to decide what events would warrant \u201c controlling \u201d the population , and what the control measures might be .\nIn other words , censorship ensures that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority .\nAnd that \u2019 s what has happened in the past 18 months .\nAs has been demonstrated , many Americans are unaware of the real numbers behind the COVID-19 pandemic .\nAnd yet , it appears that the only people being censored in social media are those who oppose the vaccine , who want to ensure proper treatment for those infected and who share their physical health challenges after taking the genetic therapy injection .\nIn other words , Americans are still uneducated by the news media or information posted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who died from the COVID-19 infection and about proper treatment .\nThe information being censored , and called false content , has enabled the government to reduce conflict by reducing debate over vaccines , masks and treatment protocols , as well as helped keep local populations under control .\nThese are the very same so-called \u201c advantages \u201d listed for censorship which have been used to manipulate your behavior and influence your thoughts .\nIronically , one of the arguments against censorship is that:40 Unfortunately , it \u2019 s clear that much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their acceptance of censorship is doing to them .\nIt \u2019 s not just about losing your freedom of speech and right to think freely ; allowing censorship at the levels you \u2019 re now seeing also reinforces your compliance while it represses your access to truths \u2014 truths that could save your life .\nAs was written in the report from the Franklin Templeton-Gallup Study , the American public has been \u201c blinded from science , \u201d and more often than not , it has been done using lies .\nIn fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by health experts are positioned in the same statements or interviews .\nFor example , in an interview with MSNBC , Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the president of the U.S. , exhibited his unique brand of justifying behavior as he talked about the virus and the shot program , saying:41 From here he advises all people who have been vaccinated to wear a mask indoors to prevent the spread of the infection .\nHis explanation is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape.\n\u201d However , as we know from other viruses , the coronavirus will continue to mutate and change , which means , from Fauci \u2019 s explanation , people will always be wearing masks to prevent the spread of a continually mutating virus .\nThe interviewer points out that as the virus continues to change , it means we won \u2019 t be able to \u201c turn the page on coronavirus , because there might be new variants \u2026 \u201d 42 to which Fauci responds , \u201c It doesn \u2019 t have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people in this country get vaccinated .\nWe could nail this down by just crushing it.\n\u201d 43 So , within the space of four minutes Fauci said that without a doubt , people can get infected after vaccination and carry enough virus to transmit the infection \u2014 BUT \u2014 if the overwhelming majority of people are vaccinated the virus would be crushed .\nThis highlights the need to seek out verifiable news reports and independent research evidence .\nHowever , it isn \u2019 t enough to know it yourself .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone \u2019 s responsibility to share the truth in a nonadversarial way that helps to

winning team , Coronado High School , threw tortillas at the losing team from Orange Glen High School , a predominantly latino school .\nThe incident was apparently captured on video , so activists and reactionary school administrators took that as a convenient excuse not bother to actually investigate what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toxic identity politics and \u2018 social justice \u2019 astroturfing was allowed to run rampant .\nThe collateral damage was devastating .\nDue to their negligence and reckless politicization of the event , activists and mainstream media were able to completely destroy the

Nature", "content": "In 1943 , the writer and literature professor C.S .\nLewis delivered a series of three evening lectures at King \u2019 s College , Newcastle .\nIn the third and final part of his lecture series titled \u201c The Abolition of Man , \u201d he spoke of how science can be misused .\nA literary giant who is known for his pro-Christian texts linked the progress of science to man \u2019 s aspiration to dominate nature .\nLewis stated , \u201c Man \u2019 s conquest of nature , if the dreams of some scientific planners are realized , means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over billions upon billions of men.\n\u201d Over half a century later , we are seeing science , in the hands of the few , being used to reshape the world .\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the disintegration of the global economy which began unraveling in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis .\nIn mid 2020 , as the economy had yet to recover , the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) announced its plan for a \u201c Great Reset \u201d to re-engineer the global economy as the world emerged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include international governmental organizations such as the United Nations and its specialized agency the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) as well as leading global corporations .\nKlaus Schwab , founder and executive chairman of WEF , called the initiative of the Great Reset \u201c The Fourth Industrial Revolution \u201d that opens up a new chapter for human development .\nUsing science and advanced technology such as artificial intelligence ( AI ) , robotics and genetic engineering , its stated goal is said to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital and biological identity.\n\u201d Steps toward the merging of digital technologies and biological systems are already taking place with the idea of the immunity passport \u2013 a form of documentation that could prove a person has received the required number of shots of an approved Covid-19 vaccine .\nOn August 27 , 2021 , the WHO released a guiding document for a digital certificate for COVID-19 vaccination status .\nFunded by organizations such as the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation , it is intended that this digital information system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every country .\nA COVID vaccination certificate system has been already rolled out in Israel , some European countries , and in US cities such as New York and San Francisco .\nCurrent uses for the vaccine passport include denying those who are unvaccinated access to restaurants , bars , gyms and trains .\nThis program separates people based on health status and creates a system of medical and socio-economic apartheid .\nGovernment issued QR-code health passes could be used to launch a China style authoritarian government program .\nWith the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and machine learning , China \u2019 s social credit system monitors and regulates people \u2019 s behavior .\nIt ranks them based on their \u2018 social credit \u2019 , rewarding \u2018 good \u2019 citizens , while punishing \u2018 bad \u2019 citizens .\nNow , it looks like China \u2019 s social scoring technocracy is coming to the West .\nUnder algorithmic governance that enforces obedience and conformity , human beings will become automatons , not being able to make independent decisions about their own actions .\nThe enslavement of humanity in cyberspace is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of biological and digital identity will bring about a radical transformation of human beings .\nLewis recognized man \u2019 s aspiration to control nature would lead to the abolition of our humanity , and that the timing of this change was not far off : In the digital age , the advancement of technology is opening up many possibilities for human beings to transform themselves .\nBy experimenting with a range of high-tech innovations , teams behind the Great Reset are now seeking to exploit this uncharted territory .\nIn July 2020 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Shaping the Future of the Internet of Bodies : New Challenges of Technology Governance.\n\u201d A 28-page document introduced the concept of the internet of bodies ( IoB ) as \u201c the network of human bodies and data through connected sensors \u201d .\nIt explained how these sensors can be attached to human bodies through consumer wearable devices or \u201c implanted within or ingested into human bodies to monitor , analyse and even modify human bodies and behavior.\n\u201d Those who are working to bring related products to market claim that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a natural concept .\nSeizing the power of this technology , this can be viewed as an attempt to claim ownership of human bodies , to gain access to the thoughts , emotions and biorhythmic data of individuals .\nTheir vision seeks to create a post-human society by transforming \u201c the human body into a new technology platform.\n\u201d Capitalising on the ongoing pandemic , while people are kept in fear and uncertainty , the end game is being played out for man \u2019 s final conquest of nature .\nThose who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its natural state steer the societal narrative in order to ensnare the population in their web of control .\nSince it declared a global pandemic on March 11 , 2020 , the WHO has quickly positioned itself as the preeminent global health authority .\nWith its own process of gathering data , research and evaluation , the organization has spearheaded global public health efforts , advising countries on how to respond to the COVID-19 crisis .\nThey have published guidance as to how to minimize the risk of spreading , or catching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 myth-buster \u2019 , which purports to debunk what they deem to be unsubstantiated information or \u201c medical misinformation \u201d online .\nIn the United States , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , working in partnership with the WHO , began to set guidelines and give recommendations .\nAs new rules and restrictions have been put into place , the concept of \u2018 public health \u2019 has become politicized .\nFrom face mask policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media framed the issues in a false dichotomy of liberal and conservative talking points .\nFirst , major media networks have dismissed anyone questioning the official pandemic narrative as \u201c conspiracy theorists \u201d and accused them of spreading harmful misinformation to the public .\nThen they indiscriminately labeled them as \u201c Covid deniers , \u201d and branded them as \u201c far right , \u201d or \u201c Trumpers , \u201d and \u201c anti-science.\n\u201d Using the rhetoric of \u2018 protecting the vulnerable \u2019 and elderly populations from the deadly virus , a moral sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with images of maskless protesters defying a stay at home order and storming into grocery stores , television cable channels have managed to paint those who questioned the official pandemic response as selfish and reckless individuals who only care about their own individual freedom .\nIn this politicization of public health , the liberal intelligentsia has tapped into the Democrats \u2019 prolonged sense of victimhood and their deep seated hatred of Donald Trump .\nMedia have successfully exploited the trauma felt by Democrats and Clinton supporters , endured during Trump \u2019 s four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their frustration and anger towards what is now being presented as a new opponent \u2013 the irresponsible , virus spreading \u201c Covidiot \u201d who continues to insist on exercising personal liberty .\nHedged into a narrow political spectrum , the political left has been encouraged to perceive conservatives as causing harm and ignoring the greater good .\nThey see the situation as Republican leaders politicizing the pandemic with \u201c FreeDumb \u201d propaganda , as was expressed recently in this article on CounterPunch .\nMeanwhile , those who oppose coronavirus restrictions are made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of those who do not agree with them .\nThe dissenters develop animosity toward the Democrats who wear masks , in turn engaging in name-calling , such as \u2018 a bunch of obedient sheep blindly following the orders.\n\u2019 What we are seeing now is a sophisticated psychological manipulation being conducted on the public .\nPsychological operations ( PSYOPS ) are techniques used by military and police forces to convey selected information to influence the perception of adversaries .\nIt works on the values and belief systems of targeted individuals , manipulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviors that are favorable to the agendas of operators .\nThis type of weaponized applied behavioral psychology has been used by the U.S. military on the battlefield and political spheres in countries like Iraq , Syria and Afghanistan , to demoralize enemy troops , foment civil unrest , and gain support of civilians so as to achieve the U.S. military objectives .\nBoth Americans and Europeans might be na\u00efve to think that this type of operation will not be carried out against them in a domestic setting , yet coordinated intelligence operations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThroughout the COVID-19 crisis , psychological warfare has been waged against ordinary people in the U.S. and worldwide .\nDivide and conquer tactics create a fog of war , using algorithms to target people \u2019 s vulnerability and exploit their emotions .\nIn this battle , the issue of vaccines has become a key issue to determine which side of the camps one is in , dividing family , breaking up friendships and marriages alike .\nThese efforts have been reinforced by Silicon Valley tech giants who are actively steering and censoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health topics , further manipulating the public and conjuring a fierce political fight on the social media platforms .\nGovernments everywhere have been pushing a pro-vaccine narrative with inadequately supported claims of safety and effectiveness in terms of the product \u2019 s ability to stop the infection and spread of Covid-19 .\nFor instance , the clinical trials of the experimental injections have yet to be completed ( Moderna \u2019 s trials go to 2022 , Pfizer \u2019 s until 2023 ) and there has been no studies of medium or long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to wait for this data because of the severity of the pandemic crisis ) and adverse event risk analysis is woefully incomplete .\nAlso , recent reports have shown that vaccinated people can still transmit the virus , and it has been reported that the so-called \u201c breakthrough \u201d cases , now overwhelming in the most vaccinated countries , may be caused by vaccination .\nFurthermore , there is now a growing body of literature showing that natural immunity is superior in strength and longevity to vaccine-induced immunity .\nInstead of engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns and clarify contradictory reports , the Cable News Network invites in various medical experts who act like spokespeople for Big Pharma .\nConcerted efforts of the legacy media have been used to suppress information on early treatment that could be beneficial to the public , paving the way for the perception that a vaccine is the only way to end pandemic .\nWith a message of \u201c we are all in this together , \u201d we were told we need to accept the government \u2019 s mandate \u201c for the public good.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical facts and is wrapped up with the concept of public duty seems to have affected prominent liberal intellectuals like Noam Chomsky , and institutions such as the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) which recently issued a puzzling statement saying that the vaccine mandates further civil liberty .\nTheir virtue-signalling has influenced public opinion on the political left .\nOrganized networks of self-righteous social justice activists have been quickly formed online to engage in the shaming and guilt-tripping of fellow citizens who dare to question or comment negatively on official policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine .\nFor instance , comedian and political commentator Jimmy Dore faced backlash on social media when he shared his own experience of adverse side effects after receiving his second dose of the Moderna Covid vaccine .\nIn an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan , he said that people started to call him an \u2018 anti-vaxxer , \u2019 and that he was pressured not to share any more information about his reactions .\nThe moral battle that has been engineered maintains its structure through marginalizing a certain population and assigning them negative attributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of color , and other immigrants , governments have often used minority groups as a means of social control and source of blame for a country \u2019 s domestic problems .\nIn the wake of 9/11 , American Muslims were scapegoated for the terrifying reality of terrorism on the U.S. soil .\nNow , in this Covid crisis , the unvaccinated have become a target for demonization .\nBy using the phrase \u201c pandemic of the unvaccinated , \u201d President Joe Biden has portrayed unvaccinated people as those who pose a threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving forward .\nPlacing blame on the unvaccinated has helped spread a new type of discrimination .\nIn some hospitals , doctors have begun to refuse treating the unvaccinated , making those who are vaccinated a priority when resources are scarce .\nVilification of those who have not gotten a shot has increased , such as when The Atlantic published an article from former Obama Homeland Security official Juliette Kayyem calling for unvaccinated people to be put on the No Fly List .\nThis type of discrimination can escalate quickly .\nArne Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Education Secretary for seven years , compared unvaccinated Americans to suicide bombers at the Kabul airport .\nIn his tweet , he noted that anti-mask and anti-vax people \u201c blow themselves up , inflict harm on those around them , and are convinced they are fighting for freedom.\n\u201d These wild imaginations have been acted out in other Western countries .\nIn France , a woman who tried to enter a shopping mall without a proof of vaccine passport was violently beaten by the security forces .\nOn the streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their confrontation with the protesters opposing the vaccine passport .\nSimilar scenes can be seen in other countries .\nNow , with the rise the alleged highly contagious Delta variant , governments are intensifying their fight against the coronavirus .\nAccompanied by media fear mongering , the drumbeat for war on Covid-19 is getting louder .\nEarlier this month , on September 9 , President Biden announced his intention to expand the executive branch \u2019 s power to require all federal workers to get vaccinated , while this mandate does not extend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intention to force all private businesses with over 100 employees to get COVID vaccinations or be tested for coronavirus at least once a week .\nDuring his announcement the President heaped even more disdain on the unvaccinated , saying they are \u201c keeping us from turning the corner \u201d and \u201c making people sick , causing unvaccinated people to die.\n\u201d He then said that the fight against the virus requires defeating those who are reluctant to get a shot , and that he intended to make them roll up their sleeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech came at a time when his administration introduced the government \u2019 s new strategy to confront domestic terrorism .\nJournalist Whitney Webb reported that despite its stated aim of tackling \u201c right-wing white supremacist \u201d , the policy targets anyone who criticizes the government \u2019 s authority .\nBut who are the unvaccinated

"De-Listed Anti-China Terror Group \u2018Rises from the Dead\u2019", "content": "As if by magic , the US de-listed a known Uyghur terrorist organization , paving the way for its legitimacy and financial support from the West , following in the dubious footsteps of US-backed terrorists groups like the MEK .\nSuspicions were raised when in late 2020 the US de-listed as a terrorist organization the East Turkestan Islamic Movement ( ETIM ) , sometimes referred to as the Turkestan Islamic Party ( TIP ) .\nThis was because the US had claimed as its rationale that the ETIM/TIP had not been active for over a decade despite the US itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as recently as 2018 , just 2 years before the de-listing .\nA 2020 Guardian article titled , \u201c US removes shadowy group from terror list blamed by China for attacks , \u201d for example , would note : The US State Department spokesperson \u2019 s claim went unchallenged by The Guardian despite the paper itself having written a 2013 article as recently as 7 years ago from the US de-listing of ETIM/TIP titled , \u201c Islamist group claims responsibility for attack on China \u2019 s Tiananmen Square , \u201d which reported : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US State Department lied in its claim the terrorist organization has been inactive for over a decade , it also illustrates the very real terrorist threat China faces nationwide from Xinjiang-based terrorist organizations .\nThe US government and the Western media in general have , for years now depicted security policies carried out by Beijing to counter this threat as \u201c genocide.\n\u201d Considering all of this it should come as no surprise then when US-based Newsweek published an article in September of this year titled , \u201c Exclusive : Despite China \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See Opportunity in Afghanistan , \u201d in which the \u201c non-existent \u201d ETIM/TIP \u2019 s spokesperson was interviewed by US media .\nThe article followed on the heels of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan , a move that clearly opened the door to a transition from America \u2019 s overt military footprint in the Central Asian country to a more covert role in backing militant groups to sow chaos not only within Afghanistan \u2019 s borders but far beyond them , including into neighboring China .\n\u201c The United States is a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we see the withdrawal of the American government today from this war in Afghanistan , which is incurring huge economic losses , as a means of confronting China , who are the enemy of all humanity and religions on the face of the Earth , \u201d a spokesperson for the political office of the Turkestan Islamic Party , commonly known as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement ( ETIM ) , told Newsweek .\nIn what appears to be the first remarks by the secretive group to an international media outlet since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorist organizations last year , the Turkestan Islamic Party spokesperson expressed hoped the US military exit last month would be followed by greater pressure against China .\n\u201c We believe that the opposition of the United States to China will not only benefit the Turkestan Islamic Party and the people of Turkestan , \u201d the spokesperson said , \u201c but also all mankind.\n\u201d Newsweek would also mention US strikes on ETIM/TIP targets in 2018 , noting : The public is expected to believe the US de-listing ETIM/TIP was based on alleged evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization clearly continuing to exist and carry out acts of terrorism , and now also openly aligning itself with US foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis China upon its \u201c reemergence.\n\u201d The US has similarly de-listed terrorist organizations it sought to use as armed proxies in conflicts against targeted nations .\nThis includes the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group ( LIFG ) the US used in its proxy war with not only Libya itself in 2011 , but after transferring fighters and weapons from North Africa to the Middle East , against Syria as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de-listed the Mujahedin-e-Khalq ( MEK ) , a terrorist organization used by the US and its allies to conduct terror operations against the government and people of Iran .\nIt \u2019 s No Secret the US Supports Separatism in Xinjiang , China The Newsweek article spends much of its space attempting to depict the ETIM/TIP as engaged in a heroic battle for independence against an \u201c oppressive \u201d Chinese occupation .\nThe article claims : Only until about midway through the article does Newsweek finally admit : Indeed , the UN does count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted by Newsweek as noting the organization \u201c poses an immediate threat to the security of China and its people.\n\u201d The UN Security Council , on the official UN website in a statement titled , \u201c Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement , \u201d explicitly notes : The UNSC statement makes two things abundantly clear .\nFirst , the UN , and by extension the majority of the international community , does not recognize the term \u201c East Turkestan , \u201d and instead recognizes the territory as Xinjinang and as part of China .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ETIM/TIP as a terrorist organization that has used violence to further its separatist ambitions .\nThe term \u201c East Turkestan \u201d is used only by separatists in contradiction to international law and the region \u2019 s internationally recognized status as Xinjiang , China .\nTherefore it is especially telling to see on the US government \u2019 s National Endowment for Democracy \u2019 s official website its programs in Xinjiang listed on a page titled , \u201c Xinjiang/East Turkestan ( China ) .\n\u201d The organizations listed , including the Uyghur Human Rights Project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress ( WUC ) both explicitly refer to Xinjiang , China as \u201c East Turkestan \u201d which they regard as \u201c occupied \u201d by China .\nThe UHRP describes itself on its website , claiming ( emphasis added ) : WUC \u2019 s website claims the organization declares an \u201c opposition movement against Chinese occupation of East Turkistan.\n\u201d Both organizations are funded by the US government with the UHRP being based in Washington D.C .\nThe World Uyghur Congress , funded by the US government , was the organization that initiated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribunal \u2019 s official website even admits ( emphasis added ) : Thus not only is the US clearly promoting separatism in Xinjiang , China by directly funding organizations promoting separatism , and not only has the US de-listed ETIM/TIP , an active terrorist organization , making it easier for the organization to allocate funding and travel globally , but it also leveraging its considerable control over global media and international institutions to depict China \u2019 s response to this concerted campaign of seperatism and terrorism aimed at its territory and people as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US in one hand is armed with a sword \u2013 \u201c reemerged \u201d ETIM/TIP terrorists keen on joining America \u2019 s encirclement and containment of China \u2013 and in the other hand , the US holds the shield of \u201c human rights advocacy \u201d to guard against China \u2019 s attempts to address this threat .\nIt is a perpetual irony that the US presumes leadership of a \u201c rules-based

world have been organising conferences and drafting white papers on the wonders of \u2018 smart cities \u2019 \u2013 formerly regular cities now transformed into high-tech \u2018 connectivity \u2019 hubs where ubiquitous A.I .\ndriven surveillance systems are fully integrated into \u2018 real time \u2019 life .\nIn addition to smart cities , there are also initiatives like \u2018 resilient cities , \u2019 \u2018 global cities , \u2019 \u2018 green cities , \u2019 \u2018 transition cities \u2019 and \u2018 future cities \u2019 \u2013 all of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in urban areas .\nIt \u2019 s no coincidence that smart cities dovetail nicely with the Great Reset agenda currently being led by Klaus Schwab \u2019 s World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , and which are being aggressively adopted by governments of the G7 nations .\nThroughout this silent technocracy revolution , no scope for opposition or debate has been provided , because in the minds of its globalist practitioners , \u201c There is no alternative .\nIt \u2019 s the future.\n\u201d This is where the problems begin .\nLeading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its committed globalist mayor , Sadiq Khan .\nIn 2018 , Khan launched Smarter London Together , as a \u2018 roadmap \u2019 to transform the capital into \u201c the smartest city in the world.\n\u201d But does smart mean more democratic , or more free ?\nLooking closer at their agenda and its broader objectives , this does not appear to be the case at all .\nThis technocracy overhaul is meant to be guided by a \u201c Smart London Board \u201d and a new Emerging Technologies Charter .\nUpon closer reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true democratic institutions and freedoms can not comfortably coexist with the new technocracy which is being constructed behind the backs of the public .\nWhat About the Roads describes the Smart City transition program and its new charter in detail\u2026 Jumping to 2020 we find the Smart London Board , the group which helps bring the objectives outlined in the Smarter London Together road map to fruition , developing the Emerging Technologies Charter , \u201c a set of criteria that digital innovations based on artificial intelligence ( AI ) , blockchain , virtual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are deployed in the capital.\n\u201d Meeting the criteria established by this charter is not mandatory in order for new technology to actually be deployed however .\nThis is important to note in order to properly interpret what is laid out in this document .\nThe most recent version of the charter was published last week .\nThe Mayor , an avowed globalist committed to fulfilling to The Great Reset agenda , says that the charter will play a significant role in the economic and social recovery of London .\nLet \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe document opens with praise for London already being one of the leading technocratic cities on the planet , highlighting the city as a hub for the research , development , and innovation of 5G , the Internet of Things ( IoT ) , and artificial intelligence ( AI ) .\nThe charter claims this infrastructure is all in place to ensure fast download speeds and rapid data processing capabilities .\nIn reality , this is the infrastructure needed for the ruling class to manage all aspects of life , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists the four principles for implementing a \u2018 Smart City \u2019 regime .\nThis is not just intended for London , but also globally : When trialling and deploying emerging technologies , the government will aspire to \u201c work in the open \u201d wherever possible and will describe what the technology is , what it can do , why it is being used and , \u201c where appropriate \u201d , the legal and ethical basis for doing so in what they call \u201c Plain English.\n\u201d Translation : the government will work behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegally and unethically as often as they feel like it .\nWhen the government says Plain English they mean short words and short sentences meant for anyone with a 9 year old \u2019 s reading comprehension skills .\nIn other words , the government will be deploying highly complicated technology , only telling you about it when they feel like it , and when they do , they \u2019 ll speak to you like you \u2019 re a child .\nThey also totally promise to speak with local communities , protect personal data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertakings in the name of being open .\nThere is no mention about being open about the negative effects of 5G on the human body or ethical problems surrounding virtual reality .\nThis is where is gets interesting , as you can now see the Schwab \u2019 s WEF political agenda emerging through various local policy pronouncements .\nThis is where the enforcement of a woke agenda comes into play : The second principle of the Emerging Technology Charter contains the usual banal platitudes about diversity and inclusiveness found at the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is one very telling detail here which reveals how this agenda paves the way for a two-tiered society .\nAmidst all the concerns about considering people from all walks of life , there is room to exclude others : For public bodies , setting out how the technology or service meets the Public Sector Equality Duty for example\u2026if certain groups are excluded from the benefit of new technologies , the technology should have a clear reason why it does not serve these groups .\nWho are these certain groups ?\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when the UK government is currently trying to bypass Parliament in an effort to implement vaccine passports via the backdoor it doesn \u2019 t take a huge stretch of the imagination to know who this is reserved for .\nIn this technocratic surveillance system a resident of or visitor to London will need a digital vaccine certificate to take part in public life .\nIf this comes to fruition it is only a matter of time until the vaccine certificate is rolled into a digital wallet for a blockchain-based Central Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different colored wristbands to differentiate between \u201c vaccinated \u201d and \u201c unvaccinated \u201d students .\nTomorrow , with just the flip of a switch or push of a button these bureaucrats behind the Emerging Technology Charter and Smart London Board will be able to disconnect anyone they deem unworthy of having access to these so-called beneficial new technologies .\nOne of the big red herrings laid out by the establishment is to distract the public with promises of \u201c data protection.\n\u201d The reality is that government and corporations care very little about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sell our personal data at every given opportunity .\nThe state also has a habit of misusing technology and misinterpreting data , and will make spurious claims of \u2018 scientific \u2019 methods used which are anything but scientific .\nIt \u2019 s a recipe for large-scale institutional corruption .\nAny virtuous pronouncements of \u201c protecting your data \u201d should be interpreted as Orwellian doublespeak : \u201c London requires safe , secure , and useful ways of using and sharing data which build trust among our partners and citizens , \u201d claim the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on to list all of the ways in which they promise to ethically collect , review , and store data , including biometric data .\nThis is perhaps the most blatantly disingenuous section of the charter .\nNot only because following this charter is entirely voluntary to begin with but because it leaves out two crucial facets of how data is already collected and used in the United Kingdom .\nThe first is the Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) , the English equivalent of the National Security Agency ( NSA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stores an incomprehensible amount of data on the British public with little to no accountability or oversight and yet the Emerging Technology Charter makes no mention of this fact .\nSo , even if those who follow the charter absolutely respected the privacy of Londoners it would be a moot point unless the mass surveillance of the GQHQ was ended .\nSecond , is the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 , also known as the Snoopers Charter .\nThis law enables the government to lie in court with impunity by enshrining parallel construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Parallel construction occurs when the Government learns of criminal activity through one source , but then gives the information to a law enforcement agency to \u201c reconstruct \u201d the investigation so that the origin of that second investigation is different from the original source .\nThe holy grail and mantra of all globalist plans is \u201c sustainability , \u201d which always invokes the supposed impending \u201c climate disaster \u201d which all of these reforms and \u2018 transitions \u2019 are meant to abate .\nBut behind the green mask , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central banking cartel which seeks to use these altruistic and \u2018 progressive \u2019 sounding concepts to establish a new century of dominance for their super class , and to herd the lower classes on to their new \u2018 green \u2019 digital plantations : What technocratic guideline would be complete without a pledge to sustainability ?\n\u201c London wants new technologies to be as sustainable as possible [ and ] contribute to the Mayor \u2019 s goal to be a net zero carbon city , \u201d according to the charter .\nAnd when does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net zero carbon city by ?\n2030 of course .\nThe lives of all Londoners will be recorded , listed to , analyzed , catalogued , tracked , traced , and controlled in Khan \u2019 s smart city but at least it will be done sustainably .\nAnd by sustainably we are to presume this means whatever it takes to further centralize and control the resources of the planet into fewer and fewer hands as part of what James Corbett calls the The 100 Trillion Dollar Bankster Climate Swindle .\nThe situation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control can be slotted into our existing infrastructure .\nThat way , neither the residents riding the Underground or the tourist snapping pictures of Big Ben and Buckingham Palace can just go about their business without noticing the enslavement grid being built around them .\nUntil one day when they can \u2019 t board their flight for lack of a health certificate , buy tickets to a play because the CCTV caught them running a red light , or buy meat because they \u2019 ve exceeded their monthly sustainable food allotment .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late

Gates uttering any of the words Young was putting in his mouth \u2013 especially the \u201c 3 billion people \u201d line .\nHowever , most of Gates \u2019 detractors have never accused him of outright claiming 3 billion people need to die , though many have referred to him in one form or another as a eugenics fan .\nThe vaccine evangelist \u2019 s claim that the world \u2019 s population , standing

Fight Club.\n\u201d \u2013 Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk The 1999 film Fight Club is an exploration into the underbelly of radical social change in modern day America .\nUnderneath the film \u2019 s anti-establishment veneer is a sardonic foray into Cultural Marxism , archetypal motifs , dissociative identity disorder and so much more .\nThe story of Fight Club is based on author Chuck Palahniuk \u2019 s 1996 novel , a transgressive-fictional account entrenched in anarchic nihilism , consumer culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe darkly comedic psychological drama has achieved cult-like status by heavily influencing pop culture through not only its secretive basement brawling but for its memetic haikus and sociopolitical underpinnings .\nBelow we \u2019 ll examine Fight Club \u2019 s depiction of Marxist mob rule , and today \u2019 s culture wars , while also dissecting the film \u2019 s uncanny foreshadowing of the 9/11 attacks\u2026 \u2018 SHADOW BOXING \u2019 \u2013 Fight Club \u2019 s Tyler Durden is emblematic of Sigmund Freud \u2019 s \u2018 death drive \u2019 impulse within the film \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21WIRE ) On a primal level , the film Fight Club is a story about an all-male members only underground fighting ring called \u201c Fight Club.\n\u201d The secretive fraternity becomes fixed on a potent yet false sense of self-realization that descends into societal mischief to reshape themselves .\nThe mercurial movement later mobilizes against the perceived shackles of postmodern society in a symbolic terror campaign .\nThe embattled counterculture within Fight Club is seen as a rejection of consumerism through the lens of Karl Marx \u2019 s commodity fetishism .\nWhile Fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conformity , looking closer , we see the film \u2019 s spotlight on victimhood and social justice , revealing its very own authoritarian prisonscape .\nFrom the outset , the David Fincher directed universe calls to mind Jean Baudrillard \u2019 s semiotic \u2018 copy world \u2019 concept known as hyperreality .\nThis alternative reality set during the film \u2019 s opening credits , depicts a high-octane CGI point of view journey inside the inner workings of the human brain .\nThe simulated imagery follows the point of view out of the pores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the top edge of a blurred revolver coming into frame .\nThe graphic sequence begins in medias res or in the midst of things , and may be seen as a reference to the narrator \u2019 s own splintered psyche .\nOver the years , many Hollywood films have employed an in medias res plot structure to great effect .\nThis technique has been employed in Tinsletown classics such as Citizen Kane ( 1941 ) , the neo-noir mystery Mulholland Drive ( 2001 ) and the inverted dreamscape of Inception ( 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Based in oral tradition , in medias res has been around for centuries and is rooted in a technique exemplified by Homer \u2019 s work in the Iliad and The Odyssey .\nJust as the Trojan War is underway epic poem the Iliad , a series of flashbacks in The Odyssey sees the journey of Odysseus is already over .\nOne could assert that Fight Club is actually an inversion of the monomyth present in the Iliad and The Odyssey .\nThis is observed when looking closely at the film \u2019 s adversarial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitt ) , who exemplifies the rebel revolutionary archetypal motif that holds dominion over the unnamed narrator ( played by Edward Norton ) .\nAdditionally , Tyler embodies a pseudo-philosophical persona that might be considered a postmodern misinterpretation of Friedrich Nietzsche .\nIn a much deeper underlying aspect , Fight Club represents a postmodern interpretation of allegorical myth and secret societies of the initiated .\nThe Gnostic demiurge exemplified by its antagonist Tyler , contains with it , loose elements of Eleusinian cult \u2019 s ritualistic practices and aspects of the Ancient Mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes throughout Fight Club depict occult imagery , specifically symbols commonly linked to Freemasonry .\nMoreover , the secretive fight club itself appears in many ways to be a nod to mystery tradition and Masonic initiation .\nFight Club \u2018 s relation to Freemasonry has drawn attention in recent years , and the masonic-based publication known as The Southern California Research Lodge wrote a piece about the similarities .\nPerhaps lesser known , is the story \u2019 s inference to the secretive communist League of the Just .\nThe League of the Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a group shrouded in claims of secret society connections .\nAs Fight Club progresses , we see that Tyler has emerged from the narrator \u2019 s unconscious mind .\nThis aspect of the story immediately recalls the archetypal analysis of Carl Jung \u2019 s Psychology of the Unconscious .\nTyler is the daemonic shadow of the narrator \u2019 s psyche , and later the viewing audience will discover the leader \u2019 s role as a Psychopomp within the fight club construct .\nThus , Tyler \u2019 s underground fight club is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense could be seen as a descent into the rungs of the underworld .\nIn Meeting the Shadow by Connie Zweig and Jeremiah Abrams , we see a concise interpretation of Jung \u2019 s shadow concept : \u201c The shadow goes by many familiar names : the disowned self , the lower self , the dark twin or brother in bible and myth , the double , repressed self , alter ego , id .\nWhen we come face-to-face with our darker side , we use metaphors to describe these shadow encounters : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil , descent to the underworld , dark night of the soul , midlife crisis.\n\u201d One could contend that the passage from Meeting the Shadow above accurately describes Fight Club \u2018 s chief alter ego , Tyler Durden .\nAs a representation of the shadow mind , Tyler is antithetical to the hero myth .\nWe can see that Tyler \u2019 s story arc and that of the narrator , is a postmodern inversion of many of Joseph Campbell \u2019 s hero \u2019 s journey phases .\nSimilarly , Fight Club appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s 14th-century epic poem the Divine Comedy .\nThe hellish origins of Fight Club illustrate a deeper more esoteric ritual that conjures Dante \u2019 s journey through the 9 circles of hell .\nTyler is a trickster , a paradoxical guide offering no true pathway to self as his self-absorbed quest in Fight Club betrays Vergil \u2019 s guided lessons of hell .\nTyler wholly embraces perdition and so to does the narrator by proxy , whose life loses all morality with no real way to traverse towards inner peace ( paradise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedic presentation masks this underlying allegory seen throughout its color saturated frames .\nTyler presents Fight Club \u2019 s narrator with a Faustian bargain , one where violent revolution supersedes moral reason .\nOver the years , there have been many interpretations concerning the true nature of Fight Club .\nAt jackdurden.com , an artful analysis contends that the film \u2018 s characters are merely an elaborate figment of the narrator \u2018 s fractured mind .\nAlthough this theory is intriguing , in order for clarity in this article , we \u2019 ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any alternate identities .\nFight Club has many overarching prefigured themes and sociopolitical underpinnings , in addition to its historical connections\u2026 As Fight Club \u2018 s narrator begins to unravel , Tyler is exposed as a confidence man , a diabolically selfish alter of the narrator .\nThe rebel leader then becomes a symbol of the hive-mind fascist cult organization known as Project Mayhem \u2013 a group arguably spawned from neo-Marxist pedagogy .\nProject Mayhem is born out of basement brawls and anarchic mischief that is later spurned towards more violent and nihilistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayhem aka \u201c Space Monkeys \u201d are groomed to participate in mob action under the direction of their spurious legion .\nAs Fight Club develops , Project Mayhem emerges as an anti-corporate , anti-consumer paramilitary-style group meant to topple modern civilization .\nThe group becomes emblematic of many real-life insurrection groups from the 20th century \u2013 but we \u2019 ll get to that into that later .\nThroughout history , the roots of Marxism and Nazism have appeared to be opposites of the political spectrum .\nHowever , these political factions have both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their inception\u2026 The blurry lines of fascism and Marxism may have its origins in Giovanni Gentile , a neo-Hegalian idealist philosopher , and member of the Fascist Grand Council .\nThe Italian Senator was also the Minister of Public Education for the government of Benito Mussolini .\nGentile advocated that society and the state should be one and that a centralized government apparatus oversees its activities .\nAdditionally , Gentile envisioned socialism forming out of revolutionary conflict .\nThis concept overlapped with the main tenet of radical Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perpetual world-wide revolt called Trotskyism .\nTrotsky was a member of the revolutionary Marxist faction the Bolsheviks founded by Valdimir Lenin and was deeply connected to Freemasonry .\nThe Russian Communist Party founder Lenin , studied and translated the 1848 political pamphlet known as The Communist Manifesto by Marx and Friedrich Engels .\nThis led to the founding of revolutionary cells within Russia and to the establishment of Marxist orthodoxy .\nThis would inevitably set the stage for Joseph Stalin \u2019 s rise to power and brutal tyrannical reign .\nUnder Stalin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths \u2019 of millions , many of whom died of forced starvation .\nThe Bolsheviks were financed by the West and in part by the the well-known Rockefeller family along with other banking barons in Wall Street and London .\nInternational cartel capitalists sought to aid in the Russian Communist Party rise , yet despite that , there \u2019 s still a perception of capitalist society being against communist society .\nThe truth seems to be much more nuanced and complicated from a historical lens .\nIn the investigative book Wall Street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ruling class in the West was in favor of centralized political and economic power .\nHowever , in order to accomplish this goal \u2013 they funded a communist revolution .\nAmerican oligarchs surreptitiously bankrolled a Marxist revolution in order to gain more political and economic control .\nThis was because of their commercial interest in a postwar Russian financial market .\nSutton expands : \u201c Revolution and international finance are not at all inconsistent if the result of revolution is to establish more centralized authority .\nInternational finance prefers to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banking community wants is laissez-faire economy and decentralized power because these would disperse power.\n\u201d Marxism divided society in two halves and has aimed to abolish private property , nationality , family tradition and religious beliefs .\nThrough a superstructure and base model of society , Marxism took the shape as an economics-focused system but that wasn \u2019 t all .\nItalian Marxist Antonio Gramsci would go onto develop a Marxist theory known as cultural hegemony which advocated the dominion of society by the ruling class to manipulate cultural norms , behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shape a radically different worldview .\nIn the book Nihilism : The Root Of The Revolution Of The Modern Age by Eugene ( Fr .\nSeraphim ) Rose , we see how China \u2019 s Cultural Revolution was created through variants of fascism and Marxism : \u201c The totalitarian Nihilist regimes of this century have undertaken , as an integral part of their programs , the ruthless \u201c reeducation \u201d of their peoples .\nFew subjected to this process for any length of time have entirely escaped its influence ; in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s sense of reality and truth inevitably suffers .\nA subtler \u201c re-education , \u201d quite humane in its means but nonetheless Nihilist in its consequences , has been practiced for some time in the free world , and nowhere more persistently or effectively than in its intellectual center , the academic world.\n\u201d In 1966 , Chinese revolutionary and Communist Party leader Mao Zedong wrecked society through a carefully planned violent social movement known as the Cultural Revolution .\nFrom 1966-1976 , Mao \u2019 s student-led paramilitary army called the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenzy , leading to a grotesque wave of mass anarchy .\nZedong \u2019 s Red Guards then tormented and killed educators , intellectuals and those politically opposed over the course of a long decade .\nThe Red Guards also saw to it that China descended into Communist control through the systematic targeting of the Four Olds ; Old Customs , Old Culture , Old Habits and Old Ideas .\nWhen looking back at the savage brutality of the Maoist Red Guards , you can clearly see the revolutionary firebrand of both Marxism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owlcation examined the forced labor and re-education used during China \u2019 s Cultural Revolution : \u201c Controlling the minds and thoughts of the Chinese people goes back to the start of communism in the late 1940s .\nThe leader of China \u2019 s communist revolution , Mao Zedong , set up a huge network of prisons , called laogai , to isolate those deemed to be troublemakers.\n\u201d The Laogai Research Foundation points out that the system \u201c In concept \u2026 is rooted in communist revolutionary ideology blended with traditional Chinese views on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether criminal or political in nature ) can be \u2018 reformed \u2019 and eliminated through forced labor and re-education.\n\u201d Although packaged in a shiny Hollywood veneer , the film Fight Club was also rampant with themes of radical anarchy and re-education\u2026 \u2018 CULT CRIME \u2019 \u2013 Fight \u2019 s Club \u2019 s Project Mayhem makes use of black operations and syndicalism to reshape society .\nAs the black-clad fight club members are further re-educated and hazed into action , we start to see the revolutionary underbelly that runs deep within the cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position at the dilapidated Victorian-style Paper Street house they graduate to the next level , becoming further entrenched in the next form of sociopolitical upheaval .\n\u201c Sooner or later , we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.\n\u201d \u2013 the narrator from Fight Club From Russia \u2019 s Bolshevik Revolution to China \u2019 s Cultural Revolution , we can see a fascist-Marxist upheaval reflected in Fight Club \u2018 s anarchy stained scenes featuring Project Mayhem .\nThe film \u2019 s \u201c space monkey \u201d provocateurs quest for a Marxist utopia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color revolution meant to cause the economic destruction of America .\nFight Club \u2018 s brand of Marxist insurrection belies at least on the surface , the slow incremental march of Fabianism and neo-liberalism of 20th Century .\nInstead , the group favors an armed paramilitary terror revolution to propel their modern communist construct .\nFight Club \u2018 s postmodern call to action is wrought with identity politics , class warfare and an underlying false left/right paradigm .\nIn the real world , Project Mayhem would just be another Marxist inspired insurrection group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe group \u2019 s misguided actions would likely enable an existing power structure to gain a foothold over society .\nHere \u2019 s a scene that depicts Fight Club \u2019 s hive mind initiation .\nWatch how Tyler motivates his \u2018 brotherhood \u2019 for the coming revolution with a Cultural Marxist diatribe\u2026 In reality , it \u2019 s important to remember fascism \u2019 s close ties to Marxism , both are political philosophies used to achieve a one-party centrally planned totalitarian government through force and suppression .\nWithin the revisionist halls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into thinking The Nazi party ( The National Socialist German Worker \u2019 s Party ) was an extreme right-wing regime .\nIn fact , they were just another variant of socialism .\nThe German National Socialists , along with the Italian Fascists expanded social safety nets and through the National Socialist People \u2019 s Welfare ( NSV ) , redirected wealth for social means .\nIn addition , NSV was tasked to head their social engineering programs .\nThe Mises Institute analyzed the often misunderstood politics of Nazi Germany by addressing its socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mises and his readers , practically no one thinks of Nazi Germany as a socialist state .\nIt is far more common to believe that it represented a form of capitalism , which is what the Communists and all other Marxists have claimed .\nWhat Mises identified was that private ownership of the means of production existed in name only under the Nazis and that the actual substance of ownership of the means of production resided in the German government.\n\u201d \u201c \u2026what specifically established de facto socialism in Nazi Germany was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1936.\n\u201d Although Italy sided with the Nazis at the start of the WW2 , Mussolini ( said to have been an MI5 agent ) would later express praise for Stalin \u2018 s Soviet Union after being fired by the Grand Fascist Council and Italy \u2018 s turn of war against Germany in 1944 .\nMussolini \u2019 s longtime Marxist-fascist beliefs recall the often ignored relationship between Italy \u2019 s Fascists and the Soviet Union \u2019 s Bolsheviks .\n\u2018 ART OF DESTRUCTION \u2019 \u2013 Project Mayhem destroy a WTC-like sphere , sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The multilayered nature of Fight Club reflects many of the emerging cultural aspects of today \u2019 s real politik , much like the film The Purge : Election Year , there are underlying political perspectives that aren \u2019 t often broached in many modern films .\nBoth motion pictures prominently feature a modern variant of today \u2019 s real world neo-Marxist violent direct action .\nHowever , Fight Club more acutely combined both Libertarian Marxism and Anarcho-Marxism .\nThe film \u2019 s militant revolutionary action is geared towards changing societal norms and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has described libertarian Marxism as the following : \u201c Modern libertarian marxism , which flowered in May 1968 , transcends marxism and anarchism.\n\u201d \u201c To call oneself a libertarian marxist today is not to look backwards but to be committed to the future .\nThe libertarian marxist is not an academic but a militant .\nHe is well aware that it is up to him to change the world \u2013 no more , no less .\nHistory throws him on the brink .\nEverywhere the hour of the socialist revolution has sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon \u2013 has entered the realm of the immediate and possible .\nPrecise definition of the forms of a socialist society is no longer a utopian scheme .\nThe only utopians are those who close their eyes to these realities.\n\u201d From here we can see an underlying system of anti-authoritarian change linked to libertarian Marxism , which does not reject the use of force for social change .\nIn many ways , to be a libertarian Marxist is to seek freedom from all but the state .\nIf we think of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a broader picture of the overlapping aspects of Marxism throughout the film .\nIf we are to acknowledge the Machiavellian political scope of Fight Club and it \u2019 s Project Mayhem menace \u2013 viewers are met with another fundamental question : how long before the anarchist-Marxist junta became just another totalitarian regime if they were able to gain control ?\nWe see the violent radicals Antifa and the Black Lives Matter contingent of America capitalizing on today \u2019 s disenfranchised cultural milieu .\nThis is similar to the fictional universe of Fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAYHEM MOB \u2019 \u2013 Tyler \u2019 s Fight Club recruits graduate to a more subversive level of violent activism in Project Mayhem .\nIn 2017 , America was brewing with tension following the 2016 presidential election of Donald Trump .\nThe choreographed immigration protests backed by George Soros \u2019 Open Society Foundations ( OSF ) \u2013 saw Antifa \u2019 s first US \u2018 riot tour \u2019 which culminated in the Charlottesville riots in Virginia .\nThen a series of \u2018 social justice \u2019 protests over Confederate statues , as \u2018 black bloc \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise their political activist brand in the US .\nIn 2020 , America was besieged by rioters in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd .\nThe transnational insurgency known as Antifa , unleashed a violent wave of riots across America with their revolutionary counterparts from Black Lives Matter ( BLM ) .\nThe Marxist-Leninist groups became synonymous with one another as cities burned across the country .\nIt should be acknowledged that prior to the death of Floyd , he had a lengthy and violent criminal record that included a felony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government employee .\nMany in American media and the Hollywood celebrity class parroted the same talking points concerning Floyd \u2019 s death something which only served to inflame the rage riots of 2020 .\nVirtually almost all major media outlets blindly decried claims of \u201c systemic racism \u201d sweeping across America without any factual basis to produce such a reckless assertion .\nIn 2020 , we saw a chain reaction of events meant to obfuscate reality .\nWhether it was the media \u2019 s unproven claims of systemic racism , the \u201c Casedemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda regarding wild fires in California .\nWe \u2019 re told that those dangers are ubiquitous and imminent .\nIn 2012 , America was transfixed on the Trayvon Martin-George Zimmerman case .\nIt was a case where mainstream media outlets deliberately fabricated elements in order craft a racially charged narrative without any sufficient evidence to prove such claims .\nIn the end , it would be revealed that the Department of Justice actively fomented social unrest by politically charging the public over racially divisive rhetoric .\nToday we see media and political action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a primary motive in many cases across the country without looking at the facts .\nVastly misunderstood cases such as the Breonna Taylor police involved shooting have seen mobs turn riotous after not getting the social justice verdict sought .\nThis reinforces the false media narrative of perceived systemic racism , rather than looking at empirical evidence in a particular case .\nFollowing the decision in the Breonna Taylor case , a U-Haul truck supplied BLM members with ready-to-go signs calling for the abolition of the police force .\nAccording to Kentucky Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunfire upon entering Taylor \u2019 s residence .\nBack in February of 2020 , Hollywood was already seen peddling the systemic racism tagline just months before American cities were set ablaze over alleged police and criminal justice abuse .\nIn fact , Joker star Joaquin Phoenix , discussed alleged racism and how it relates to Hollywood during his acceptance speech at BAFTA \u2013 well before the summer of rage riots .\nIn early October of 2020 , former First Lady Michelle Obama further stoked the flames of racial divide by attempting to reframe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful.\n\u201d The stylized propaganda video spot presents mainstream media \u2019 s familiar Left vs .\nRight paradigm .\nThe stylized video presented mainstream media \u2019 s familiar Left vs

display\u2026 In August of 2020 , leaked body cam footage of Floyd \u2019 s attempted arrest by Minneapolis Police , showed that the alleged racial motivation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of this was on the heels of America careening on the edge after scientifically questionable Covid lockdowns caused massive economic ruin and emotional distress .\nIn the aftermath of Floyd \u2019 s death , we still have yet to see clear comprehensive evidence of a racially motivated crime .\nHowever , that became the impetus for the burning and looting of many American cities in 2020 .\nAfter the showtrial for Derek Chauvin , an alternative juror expressed fear for her life if a guilty verdict wasn \u2019 t delivered .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Brandon Mitchell , was found to have supported BLM at an event in Washington , DC .\nThe Daily Mail released footage of George Floyd \u2019 s encounter with Minneapolis Police \u2013 watch closely to see how the event unfolded\u2026 In 2020 , the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and former DOJ Attorney General Bill Barr investigated the funding behind Antifa \u2019 s organized violent activities .\nThat investigation has since gone cold .\nIn 2019 , US Senator Bill Cassidy and Ted Cruz introduced a resolution to declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious attack on journalist Andy Ngo .\nYet rather ironically , acting DHS head Chad Wolf outlined that white supremacists are the \u201c most persistent and lethal \u201d internal \u201c threat \u201d to the US .\nThe report came after weeks of political pressure over Wolf \u2019 s alleged favorability towards the Trump administration as radical left groups have continued rioting , vandalizing and looting across America .\nThen FBI director Chris Wray , also concluded that aside from lone wolf terror , white supremacists are the greatest threat to America \u2013 but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , the white supremacy threat has been echoed by other intel agencies and media without any credible evidence .\nIn October of 2020 , several men faced federal charges and state charges in an apparent plot to kidnap Michigan Gov .\nGretchen Whitmer before the US presidential elections .\nThe alleged plot was for retaliation over COVID-19 restrictions the Democratic governor enforced on the state .\nIn July of 2021 , it was revealed that the FBI played an even bigger role in the Whitmer kidnapping plot then was initially reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sordid history fabricating terror plots in the US .\nThe political timing of this FBI foiled plot should not be understated as it perfectly fits the FBI \u2019 s recent top threat list narrative .\nTurns out , the media framed militia gone awry were actually entrapped FBI informants used in a sting operation most likely to frame-up American patriots .\nMass media often injects their own formula for laying out a familiar series of polarizing political points in the aftermath of any high profile or \u2018 tragic \u2019 event .\nThere is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric , social media declarations and random writings and photos to be seen as an ironclad motive for a crime .\nThe Michigan militia plot like others before rapidly descended into a barrage of politically motivated theorizing without looking at the real evidence .\nThere \u2019 s been a long history of social upheaval by way of splintered political action groups\u2026 The resurgence of America \u2019 s present day inner-city violence caused by Antifa and BLM takes a page from the Nazi party \u2019 s Sturmabteilung ( SA ) .\nThe SA was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d similar to Italy \u2019 s fascist \u201c blackshirts , \u201d who were a paramilitary force created to oppose any and all political opponents .\nThe brownshirts consisted of ex-soldiers and Nazi bodyguards who were used in riots who battled other socialist groups for control to overthrow Germany .\nThe SA stormtroopers used brutal force , suppressing free speech , while stifling other nationalist political groups in order to gain a foothold over society .\nIn 1932 , the Communist Party of Germany ( KPD ) formed the militant group Antifaschistische Aktion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , including Germany \u2019 s Social

became the umbrella network for the supposedly decentralized far-left militant extremist movement in the US .\nOne of the particularly virulent strains of violent extremism from the network is the chapter known as Rose City Antifa .\nIt should be mentioned that Antifa and the Marxist-founders of BLM have openly called the abolition of certain elements of society .\nIn 2020 , Project Veritas revealed that Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight club-like training sessions for new recruits .\nIn recent years , we \u2019 ve seen symbolic violence become more incendiary and the pantomime battles of

Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley in the wake of civil unrest following George Floyd \u2019 s death .\nIn July of 2020 , OSF invested $ 220 million into black-led racial justice groups .\nThen the foundation invested $ 150 million in five-year grants for selected groups , such as the Black Voters Matter Fund ( BVMF ) and others .\nBVMF is a self-described \u201c power building organization , \u201d that has taken a very polarizing position on perceived racial injustice .\nThe BVMF website is littered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It appears as though the group has attempted to gain more political capital in the wake of America \u2019 s violent riots carried out by members of Antifa and BLM .\nThe other $ 70 million from OSF was then allocated to support changes to policing and the criminal justice system .\nIn August of 2016 , you might remember it was reported that DC Leaks published a report from OSF \u2019 s alleged plans to use civil unrest caused by the death of Freddie Gray : \u201c

enforcement.\n\u201d The leak report also stated that Open Society Foundations approved a $ 650,000 dollar donation to BLM : \u201c Recognizing the need for strategic assistance , the U.S. Programs Board approved $ 650,000 in Opportunities Fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for the groups at the core of the burgeoning # BlackLivesMatter movement.\n\u201d Additionally , here \u2019 s a passage from the

movements as they evolve to affect real policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer-term institutions.\n\u201d Some of the most notable uprisings in modern American history include designer social justice campaigns \u2013 many of which have George Soros money behind them .\nThrough a vast network of foundations and social front groups each of these have a common thread \u2013 they have all evolved into some form of violent social unrest .\nIn many cases , unrest is steered by paid provocateurs .\nMedia outlets generally do not like to cover this side of the events because it simply doesn \u2019 t fit the favored \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most members of the public \u2013 especially the protesters themselves \u2013 have little or no idea what is driving street violence and the \u2018 crisis \u2019

institutions like the UN or IMF .\nAs shock and awe imagery is used in order to manipulate the public \u2019 s political perspective .\nThis is how the US and its CIA conduct their destabilization

bail system they contend unfairly imprisons poor people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 , it was revealed that the Ford Foundation , one of America \u2019 s largest private foundations put forth $ 2 billion dollars into various social change groups .\nAnother way in which large donors have subverted the criminal justice system is through the NGO The Bail Project .\nThe group has received scrutiny for spending $ 26million to release some 12,000 violent criminals in recent history .\nThe group has also come under fire for its apparent role in sending money for the release of BLM rioters , including one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Boston Post revealed that the Ford Foundation board members hold close ties to the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris campaign as alumni executives .\nThe Federalist explained :

Fight Club \u2019 s world\u2026 \u2018 Five Eyes \u2019 in the Age of False Flags Fight Club \u2018 s Fight Club \u2019 s starts on the 31st floor of a downtown building overlooking the headquarters of several credit card company buildings perched along a fictional New York-like skyline .\nThe scene unfolds as the film \u2018 s unnamed narrator has the appearance of being held hostage at gun point by the vitriolic antagonist Tyler .\nThe darkly lit opening scene ( also the film \u2018 s climatic ending scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly remembering a domestic terror plot .\nHe recalls a series of controlled demolition charges strategically set around the foundation of a dozen downtown financial district skyscrapers .\nIn a darkly comedic twist , prior to the domestic terror plot , Tyler \u2019 s fight club procures human fat from liposuction clinics to make soap .\nThe spurious leader then sold the newly made paper street soap to high-end department stores \u2013 only to later use the rendered fat for explosives .\nIn ancient times , soap was used for rituals by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred rites .\nOne could contend that Tyler \u2019 s explosives made from soap is a radical ritual purging society .\nAccording to Tyler , we learn that in \u201c three minutes , this is it , ground zero.\n\u201c The scene is palpable with an uncanny reference to the real-life horror of the 9/11 attacks at the World Trade Center buildings .\nThis sets the stage for a domestic terror plot meant to topple a sky full of financial institutions in an attempt to erase America \u2019 s debt record .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c front row seats to this theater of mass destruction , \u201c following the detonation of explosives housed in the bowels of corporate institutions .\nWe \u2019 re told that the narrator knows this because the film \u2019 s main rival , Tyler , knows this .\nThis revelation becomes the first major clue that Tyler is in fact an alter ego of the identity disorder plagued narrator in Fight Club .\nIt should be mentioned , that the second phase of the WTC 9/11 attacks which occurred at the South Tower happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The opening scene demonstrates the startling prescience of Fight Club as whole , something which looms in the backdrop for the entirety of the film to this day .\nIf we deconstruct Fight Club \u2018 s scene depicting the heavily coordinated terror plot , we see that Project Mayhem \u2019 s revolution will ultimately be a false one .\nOne could surmise that the deliberate creation of economic ruin by the radical group would most likely be opening the door bank bailout scam in its aftermath .\nThis would likely further enrich the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militant group appeared to be against .\nAdding to that , any terror directed at banks could also be used as a pretext to further bolster a Great Reset agenda .\nThis could function just like the Covid lockdowns and subsequent mandates have in the wake of today \u2019 s simulated plandemic .\nThe increased calls for global governance by World Economic Forum ( WEF ) Founder Klaus Schwab and the Davos elite could use almost any crisis to further a technocratic march towards a New World

convenient cover for the economic terror inducing central banking cabal ?\nThe modern-day machinists of bank runs and capital seizures , have sought to weaken the sovereignty of nations through manufactured financial crises in an effort to consolidate resources for decades .\nAlthough this is pure speculation regarding the make-believe story line of Fight Club \u2013 one could consider the possibility of such an outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s very possible that Fight Club \u2019 s paramilitary mercenaries might be a form of controlled opposition .\nThe fictional group would likely be steered by government infiltrators , covertly serving an order they appear to oppose .\nThis is a reality in the world today , which is often omitted from most TV and film narratives pretending to depict real world gangs and terrorist organizations .\nThe fact is , in the real-world ; truth is often stranger than fiction .\nEconomic hit men like John Perkins have utilized organizations like the @ @ @ @ @ @

business had employed these very systems .\nThis includes corporations such as Exxon , Walmart , General Motors and Monsanto to name a few .\nSomething that has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club , is the existence of offsite file storage options .\nIn the event of disaster recovery , the credit headquarters depicted in Fight Club would have had redundant backup systems in place in lieu of a mass casualty incident .\nIndeed , computer data is still routinely recorded on magnetic tape by some of the world \u2018 s largest corporations , even in the advent of cloud computing networks and data vaulting .\nFight Club \u2019 s orchestrated financial district attack would be an improbable scenario , given the spy capabilities not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world over .\nOn a geopolitical scale , the intelligence stagecraft of various Western allied nations has enabled the rise of terrorist groups and incidents throughout the world .\nIn many cases , they are in fact often found to be behind the scenes engineers propelling much of the current conflict seen today .\nOne of the main architects that propelled the \u2018 War On Terror \u2019 era , was deceased former NSA head Zbigniew Brzezinski .\nBrzezinski developed Osama bin Laden as a US intelligence asset , helping to build the al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club \u2018 s premise that a highly theatrical large-scale terror plot would go unnoticed , is just as false as the official 9/11 narrative .\nIn the era of mass surveillance , data encryption and cryptanalysis techniques techniques via the NSA , this idea is mind-boggling .\nIt \u2019 s more likely Project Mayhem would have been secretly aided by a Deep State cabal .\nTruth be told , the existence of mass data collection was secretly brought to fruition over the past several decades .\nIn 1947 , the \u201c Five Eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand , the United Kingdom and the United States .\nIt was further bolstered by the NSA \u2019 s ECHELON program established formally in 1971 .\nIn 1988 , the spy agency \u2019 s sophisticated data gathering were laid bare in an article written by investigative journalist Duncan Campbell that was published with the New Statesman .\nDuncan \u2019 s exclusive report revealed the story of whistleblower Margaret Newsham , and stated the following : \u201c She has worked in the US and Britain for two corporations which manufacture signal intelligence computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ford Aerospace and Lockheed.\n\u201d Following Newsham \u2018 s departure from Lockheed in 1984 , she filed a lawsuit alleging corruption concerning US government \u201c black projects.\n\u201c In 1988 , Newsham cited a Ronald Reagan Executive Order that warned against the \u201c unauthorized disclosure \u201d of classified material and had an unwillingness to talk to journalists .\nSometime later , Newsham \u2018 s role in intercepting conversions in real-time would be outlined by Cleveland \u2019 s daily paper , The Plain Dealer following leaked information by those on Capitol Hill .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s involvement in listening in on a call from US Senator Strom Thurmond .\nThis took place while Newsham was stationed at the NSA \u2019 s Menwith Hill ECHELON facility in England .\nAlthough Thurmond was no stranger to controversy both politically and privately , the NSA \u2019 s spying on a US citizen through the Five Eyes/ECHELON project , raised many questions over the legality and ethics of mass surveillance .\nBelow is a compelling passage from Duncan \u2019 s \u201c They \u2019 ve Got It Taped \u201d piece published with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , British and Allied intelligence agencies are soon to embark on a massive , billion-dollar expansion of their global electronic surveillance system .\nAccording to information given

P415 , the system will be run by the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) .\nBut the intelligence agencies of many other countries will be closely involved with the new network , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany and Japan-and , surprisingly , the People \u2019 s Republic of China .\nNew satellite stations and monitoring centres are to be built around the world , and a chain of new satellites launched , so that NSA and its British counterpart , the Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) at Cheltenham , may keep abreast of the burgeoning international telecommunications traffic.\n\u201d According to Campbell \u2019 s luminary piece , over a billion calls could be taped then and that was just in the UK .\nMany of the questions raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 \u2019 s still reverberate today\u2026 In fact , this rang true during FISA-gate fiasco carfted by ex-spy Christopher Steele for PR firm Fusion GPS , Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) and Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 campaign .\nRegardless of how you view the Trump presidency , the startling \u2018 Russiagate \u2018 spy games set in motion by political rivals and those in the intelligence community are still hard to fathom .\nNow over five years later , the vast political scandal is still unfolding , as former president Barack Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trump-Russia investigation .\nThe recently released documents are yet another example that some critics claim was a deliberate attempt to nullify the election results of 2016 .\nWell-known journalist James Bamford and former high-ranking NSA official William Binney , have come forward to share the inner workings of intelligence services and bulk data collection .\nThis was well before the NSA spying outlined during the famed Edward Snowden saga of 2013 .\nIn September 2020 , a US federal appeals court ruled that the phone metadata collection program used by the NSA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When thinking of spying and data collection , it wouldn \u2019 t be a stretch to consider Fight Club \u2019 s fictitious revolutionary-style plot to demolish credit buildings was a highly orchestrated event .\nOne involving multiple intelligence agencies that would

scene two years prior to the World Trade Center attacks seen in New York .\nThe opening and ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an uncanny resemblance to the real-life 9/11 attacks that took place in New York .\nSome have suggested , that the multiple allusions to the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings appear to also conjure the debated theory called predictive programming .\nPredictive programming is a controversial theory contending that the masses have been socially engineered through fictional works in film , television and other programming .\nBy way of various media formats , information is filtered to the general public in order to later have them acquiesce to preplanned future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terror \u2019 era , the idea of predictive programming has gained traction , as there have been many uncanny references to the 9/11 attacks .\nIn fact , the programming predates the tragic events themselves in both film and TV .\nSome of the most notable include the dystopian sci-fi The Matrix ( 1999 ) , the terror attack blockbuster The Siege ( 1998 ) , the shape-shifting artificial intelligence nuclear warfare flick Terminator 2 : Judgement Day ( 1991 ) .\nThen there was The Lone Gunmen ( 2001 ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade Center attacks \u2013 just months prior to the real-life attack on September 11th , 2001 .\nUpon every fall , another dark anniversary of the 9/11 tragedy is ritualized for public consumption .\nDebate looms over the how of the 9/11 attacks and the who , and there \u2019 s even more of a contentious dispute over the collapse of WTC Building 7 .\nSince then , other alleged methodology used to carry out the crimes of that day challenge the very nature of the 9/11 attacks .\nFight Club \u2018 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its predated imaginary 9/11-style nightmare is still haunting to this day .\nTo this day , many believe the 9/11 attacks were part of a deep cover operation beyond anything a band of al-Qaeda terrorists could have ever conjured on their own .\nWith this in mind , Fight Club \u2018 s Project Mayhem domestic terror bombing of the financial district buildings offers a window into the covert nature of the real 9/11 attacks .\nFight Club was first released two years and a day prior to the 9/11 attacks on Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending scenes were loosely set in New York-like skyline , the scenes actually depict buildings across Los Angeles .\nIn fact , the twin Century Plaza Towers of downtown Los Angeles were featured in the film \u2018 s skyscraper window view .\n\u2018 CRIME OF THE CENTURY \u2019 \u2013

Lumpkin , the pre-planned event composed of personnel from the CIA and the US military .\nIt was evidently cancelled following the real life attacks , something which government officials quickly brushed off as merely a \u2018 bizarre coincidence.\n\u2018 Global Research \u2018 s Professor Michel Chossudovsky further explained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the morning of September 11th , 2001 : \u201c

prompts more questions concerning prior knowledge of the attacks among those in the intelligence community .\nLooking even deeper , there were other questionable activities concerning the lead up to the 9/11 attacks\u2026 In a recent article reviewing the players involved in the orchestrated events of that day , former CIA case officer turned American columnist , Philip Giraldi , had this to say : \u201c The Israelis were also running more sophisticated intelligence operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were focused on Washington \u2019 s military capabilities and intentions .\nSome specialized

peculiar behavior she had seen , and five Israeli men , were promptly arrested a few hours later .\nThe group was then dubbed the Dancing Israeli \u2019 s in alternate media circles .\nAccording to official FBI report the men were seen very jovial , hugging and high-fiving each other while supposedly overlooking the destruction in NY .\nThe five men from Urban Moving System were eventually questioned by FBI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least two men had suspected links to the Mossad .\nThe group were released after 71 days in custody and deported .\nSubsequently , shortly after the five suspects were arrested the owners of Urban Moving System fled the US without explanation .\nFight Club included a scheme to destroy a corporate sculpture that looked nearly identical to a large bronze piece in the World Trade Center Plaza called \u201c The Sphere \u201d ( left photo after 9/11 ) .\nIt would be another strange coincidence in the film .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fountain between the twin towers prior to the attacks on 9/11 .\nThe robust and weighty World Trade Center sculpture was designed by Fritz Koenig and rather ironically symbolized peace through world trade .\nThe World Trade Center complex was brought to fruition by the Rockefeller family and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey ( PANYNJ ) .\nThe massive building project was \u2018 spearheaded \u2019 by David Rockefeller to reignite the Lower Manhattan area .\nOn an intriguing note , the towers themselves were nicknamed after David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former New York Governor and Vice President under President Gerald Ford .\nDavid Rockefeller ( see left photo ) was described as a philanthropist and banker .\nHowever , much of his legacy is tied to the creation of well-known think-tanks the Council on Foreign Relations , The Trilateral Commission .\nThe globalist also played a central role on the steering committee for the secretive Bilderberg Group established in 1954 .\nThe mainstream media has often masked the significance of the Bilderberg Group \u2019 s regular gatherings of corporate CEO \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass and royalty .\nIn fact , there \u2019 s a concerted effort to divert attention away from the group \u2019 s influence on foreign policy and world finance in general .\nThe Bilderberg Group \u2019 s exploits have slowly been uncovered with each passing year as the list of attendees seem to change and multiply with each new conference location .\nAdditionally , there \u2019 s the sphere of influence held by various power-hungry groups such as The Trilateral Commission , which materialized in 1973 via Rockefeller and perennial US foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also joined by fellow Bilderberg attendee and longtime policy advisor Henry Kissinger .\nContrary to what most people think \u2013 the vast majority of The Trilateral Commission \u2019 s members have been from countries outside of America .\nFor further evidence that a cadre of hidden hands direct global interests , one only needs to look into the high-powered pursuits of Bilderberg attendees .\nSecretive think-tanks that have played a crucial role in a multi-national sovereignty override through transnational corporations and world trade partnerships like the currently defunct Transatlantic partnership ( TTIP ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past decade .\nFollowing Rockefeller \u2019 s death in March of 2017 , the NY Times reveled in the powerful political machinations of the globalist banker : \u201c He spent his life in the club of the ruling class and was loyal to members of the club , no matter what they did , \u201d The New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote in 2002 , citing the profitable deals Mr. Rockefeller had cut with \u201c oil-rich dictators , \u201d \u201c Soviet party bosses \u201d and \u201c Chinese perpetrators of the Cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is ultimately tied to globalism and vast social engineering programs .\nSix weeks prior to the 9/11 attacks , Larry Silverstein aka \u2018 Lucky Larry \u2019 ( left photo ) via his company Silverstein Properties and World Trade Center Properties LLC took title of the massive WTC complex in July of 2001 for $ 3.2 billion .\nSilverstein was eventually awarded $ 4.55 billion in a catastrophic insurance payout from the 9/11 destruction .\nIt was also reported that Silverstein and his backers who included Lloyd Goldman and Joseph Cayr , received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment of $ 124 million .\nThe WTC site was secured for a 99-year lease deal worth $ 800 million .\nThe payout-partnership with Silverstein in the aftermath of 9/11 didn \u2019 t end there , as WTC partner Frank Lowy ( left photo ) also benefited from insurance claims .\nAll told , many of Lowy \u2019 s unlucky properties have become the target of several dire warnings and unbelievable terror atrocities .\nOver the years , there \u2019 s been catastrophic attacks on Lowy \u2019 s Marriott Hotels in Islamabad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2018 SECRET CLUB \u2019 \u2013 Fight Club turn new recruits at a local bar into a sleeper cell .\nThroughout the saturated neo-noir frames of Fight Club , Project Mayhem functionaries dutifully carry out orders to propel the group \u2018 s activism .\nWhether it \u2019 s the destruction of private property , random assaults or large-scale politically charged violence .\nThe rogue group , although an imaginary cult , has all the hallmarks of a controlled opposition radical mob .\nPerhaps one that has been coerced and infiltrated by an established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and terror .\nIn the real-world , NGOs guided by government operatives have trained thousands of activists .\nA prime example of this was Western backed political opposition groups during the infamous Arab Spring protests .\nThe violence was intentionally misrepresented by front operations and advocacy groups .\nLater under the direction of the US and their allies , militant groups were implanted to further destabilize Libya and Syria .\nThis created a cloud of confusion over the wave of dissent that was aided and abetted by Western intervention schemes .\nWhen looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot , one is also reminded of the FBI \u2019 s real-life role in handling a disastrous WTC sting operation .\nThe FBI was found to have been involved in a 1993 attempted bombing on the World Trade Center .\nIt turned out that the FBI trained some of those involved , while also supplying the explosive material .\nThose explosives were later detonated underneath one of the world \u2019 s tallest buildings \u2013 without the FBI stopping the plot .\nThe FBI lured former Egyptian army officer named Emad A. Salem into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prized undercover operative and confidential informant for the agency .\nOne of the central parts of Fight Club is that a rogue group of men receive militaristic training , later organize attacks .\nThe film provides a window into how willing participants are groomed into direct violent action .\nIn one such scene , we see Fight Club \u2018 s Project Mayhem mercenaries are on assignment in a plot to destroy a local Starbucks .\nProject Mayhem loses Robert Paulson ( played by Meatloaf ) , after being shot by police during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet palpable , as it sees the group operating in the cover of night to carry out a mysterious set of orders designed to create chaos .\nWatch Project Mayhem \u2019 s black operation dissolve into an authoritarian cult chant propelling the underground movement\u2026 Domestically in America , it has been well documented that the FBI created a counter-intelligence program known as COINTELPRO .\nNot only was the program a way to influence , but also a way to disrupt and coerce political factions from the inside out .\nThe FBI program infiltrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political spectrum .\nAccording to reports these groups included but were not limited to the following : \u201c The Black Panther Party , The Communist Party of America , the Ku Klux Klan , the Socialist Workers Party , the New Left , the Students for a Democratic Society , the American Indian Movement , the Chicano Movement , the Puerto Rican Liberation Movement , Communist groups , anti-war organizations , Hollywood stars sympathetic to these groups , and civil rights leaders.\n\u201d On March 8th 1971 , \u201c secret files \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania were allegedly stolen and subsequently released to media organizations .\nFor the first time , the FBI \u2019 s domestic spying and infiltration on political and protest groups in America was laid bare .\nThe files were released by a group calling themselves \u201c The Citizens \u2019 Commission to Investigate the FBI.\n\u201d The apparent heist took place on the same night as the first historic bout between heavyweight boxers Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali at Madison Square Garden .\nThose involved in the Media office break-in wouldn \u2019 t be revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 FBI agents had worked the case .\nIn fact , \u201c there were no alarms , surveillance cameras , or locks on most of the filing cabinets , \u201d at the FBI office in Media .\nThe courts later ordered the FBI to reveal part of their counterintelligence program , disclosing six operations run by FBI field offices throughout the country .\nThe documents also revealed a specific emphasis to funnel covert aid to \u201c White Hate Groups , \u201d from 1964-71 , that largely diverted those funds to the KKK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets .\nSimilarly , FBI efforts to infiltrate New Left groups and the Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) fixating on anti-war , student and feminist causes .\nBetween 1956 and 1971 the FBI \u2019 s controversial program influenced and radicalized hundreds of left-wing and right-wing groups to control and neutralize political dissidents across America .\nThroughout the 1960 \u2019 s and the 1970 \u2019 s the CIA \u2019 s Operation CHAOS \u201c collected substantial amounts of information on domestic dissidents from 1967 to 1973 , \u201d as admitted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also related to the overseas Phoenix Program ( Operation Phoenix ) which was used in Vietnam to tear apart the political infrastructure through the use of informants , agent provocateurs , and targeted assassinations .\nThe prototype for modern deep state intelligence programs goes back to the formation of the Office of the Coordinator of Information ( COI ) , an intelligence propaganda agency in 1941 .\nThe COI was later succeeded by Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) , a wartime intelligence apparatus created in 1942 that focused on psychological warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Security Coordination ( BSC ) .\nYears later , research revealed the stunning evolution and use of covert intelligence operations the world over .\nNATO \u2019 s paramilitary-style stay-behind-armies were stated to have been comprised of Operation GLADIO .\nThe origins of GLADIO have been well documented and the secretive counterintelligence operation has been linked to a wave of right-wing \u201c false flag \u201d terror attacks across Europe throughout the 1950 \u2019 s into the 1980 \u2019 s .\nThe anti-communist organizational designs were directly connected to that of the CIA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and British special forces reportedly facilitating the training .\nFrom this , we can view global operations like GLADIO in addition to the post-9/11 War On Terror security surge as a form of power politics used to aggressively influence the foreign policy of other nations through the use of covert militarization .\nHere Dr. Daniele Ganser discusses his seminal 2005 book , NATO \u2019 s Secret Armies : Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe .\nGanser asserts that covert armies were used to subvert the political interests of various nations through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension\u2026 In 2014 , a social science program directed by Minerva Research Initiative and the Department of Defense ( DoD ) was to study the behavior of peaceful activism and how political ideology shapes protest and other social movements .\nSome researchers viewed this as a reconstitution of the 1960 \u2019 s Cold War-era ( Project Camelot ) social science program used to detect , infiltrate and steer political protest .\nWestern intelligence agencies regularly utilize double agents and informants under a flag of security , yet many in mockingbird controlled media halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations and their supporting role in directing foreign policy aims across the globe .\nOver the years many so-called shooting/terror/attacks involve individuals being monitored by security services prior to an alleged act taking place .\nThe infamous place where a \u2018 lone wolf \u2019 graduates into the ranks of a known wolf .\nOften those being watched by authorities exhibit all the tell-tale signs of being a patsy or an informant , working for either localized law enforcement or an intelligence agency .\nThis is done to avoid jail time for previous criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of low-life criminals , and mentally disturbed individuals to fulfill various roles in entrapment stings or sometimes as bonafide crisis actors during so-called terror attacks .\nFight Club \u2018 s Project Mayhem mimics aspects of being an intelligence operation built to employ strategy of tension techniques through the group \u2019 s various black operations .\nIn the aftermath of 9/11 the CIA setup a facility called \u2018 Penny Lane \u2018 that was used to train terrorists to be double agents .\nThe Penny Lane facility was unlike any other building in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said to have beds , kitchens and a patio for its prisoners .\nThe money to pay informants and double agents was provided for by the CIA under the codename \u2018 Pledge.\n\u2019 Penny Lane was named after the Beatles tune and was affiliated with another secret facility called \u2018 Strawberry Fields \u2019 a name also taken from the British rock group .\nThough the operation was touted as being successful , the CIA lost touch with many of its newly trained double agents at the time .\n20 years after 9/11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s \u201c War On Terror \u201d era was laid bare to the public after the sudden apparent withdraw from Afghanistan .\nThe disastrous pull-out in the mineral rich country still has many countries seeking to house tens of thousands of unknown and unvetted Afghani refugees .\nIn addition , it is stated that over $ 90 billion dollars worth of US military equipment was abandoned in the pivotal geopolitical hot-spot .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that British , French and American intelligence had triple agent spies close to Al-Qaeda \u2019 s inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 .\nThe MI6 failed to act on this information , as the CIA was simultaneously asking about spies in Afghanistan \u2013 a few weeks later , the events of 9/11 happened .\n\u2018 DUPING DELIGHT \u2019 \u2013 Fight Club \u2019 s narrator and identity alter Marla Singer , fake sickness at support groups for the terminally ill .\nThe 1930 \u2019 s ushered in the rise of European fascism and with it The Frankfurt School , a social theory school linked to the Institute for Social Research , at Goethe University Frankfurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were comprised of those with ties to the CIA , KGB , United Nations and the Rockefeller-funded New School .\nAlthough there has been a longstanding controversy over what was taught at the Frankfurt School , many researchers and critics believe it created the architecture for what is known as Cultural Marxism .\nThe Frankfurt School \u2019 s \u2018 critical theory \u2019 has paved the way for what has often been described as political correctness , multiculturalism and identity politics that fall under the banner of Cultural Marxism .\nIt has been theorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a decades long process meant to subvert traditional culture through various social institutions , education centers and media .\nA good example of this includes the New York Times \u2019 1619 Project , a radical propaganda campaign that is a bold attempt to rewrite American history through racial identity .\nWhat \u2019 s important to note , is that Marxism didn \u2019 t simply vanish with the fall of the Soviet Union \u2013 it transformed , surreptitiously invading culture through many different forms .\nCultural Marxism is one aspect of this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Lives Matter social justice campaigns , the multi-million dollar Democratic Party-affiliated NGO organized Women \u2019 s March , the revolution against cultural landmarks , critical race theory objectives , America \u2019 s engineered riots or the banning of religious gatherings .\nIt \u2019 s all meant to reshape society from the inside out by ridding tradition and moral values along the way .\nOther modern variants of Marxism include the media sensationalized reports discussing so-called toxic masculinity .\nThis media driven buzzword came directly on the heels of the # MeToo movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reignited a new-wave of feminism in America .\nThe feminist movement emerged out think-tanks such as the Ford Foundation and Redcliffe Institute , both of which had deep ties to banking barons like the Rockefellers .\nIronically , just the kind of patriarchy which feminism has appeared to outwardly oppose .\nMany researchers believe that feminism is just another way to break up family tradition .\nRather than empowering women it has actually perpetuated victimhood , while also aiding the reversal of gender roles in society .\nOthers have even suggested the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaceable workers .\nJay Dyer of Jay \u2019 s Analysis also astutely observed a larger overarching theme linking globalism and feminism as an intelligence driven construct shaped by think-tanks .\nThis intriguing analysis should be considered when exploring Fight Club \u2018 s perspective on gender : \u201c \u2026the banking elite funded revolutionaries in Russia and China to destabilize the existing regimes , so with feminism and \u201c women \u2019 s liberation , \u201d the destabilization of the masses could be more easily accomplished , not just through altering social structures , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender is a long , scientific process that began with women \u2019 s liberation and has now consummated in the synthetic rewrite of all nature .\nAlong this long , technocratic and scientistic path the oligarchs reasoned that the inversion of all existing orders through subversion would result in the socialistic Brave New World of enforced androgyny \u2013 the feminization of men , and the masculinization of women.\n\u201d Fight Club \u2018 s vivid fight scenes at Lou \u2019 s Tavern could be viewed as an inversion of and not unlike the Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u201c fight club \u201d usher in a postmodern men \u2019 s liberation , which if real , would likely be constructed by all the same oligarchs reshaping society .\nFurthermore , beneath Fight Club \u2018 s machismo , actually lies an emasculated and nihilistic troupe without any sense of purpose .\nOut of their frustration , they seek to destroy in a fashion befitting Ordo ab Chao , rather than create .\nAs the narrator \u2019 s personality shifts in Fight Club , he is seen attending various support groups for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remaining Men Together \u201d shows him join a group of men suffering from testicular cancer .\nThroughout the scene there \u2019 s a quirky air of absurdity as the dispassionate insomniac narrator becomes a \u201c tourist \u201d pretending to be as emasculated as those around him .\nLater on we \u2019 re told that the narrator \u2019 s masculinity is metaphorically on life support .\nEventually , his disenfranchised IKEA packaged world gives rise to his neo-Marxist tendencies personified by his alter Tyler .\n\u201c All of this , the guns the bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with a girl named Marla Singer.\n\u201d \u2013 the narrator from Fight Club While much has been made of the so-called masculinity of Fight Club , in the character Marla Singer ( played by Helena Bonham Carter ) , we see a decidedly masculine female lead devoid of any feminine nurturing or familial tradition .\nInstead , the black-clad femme fatal appears like a modern-day Succubus feeding off the energy of the narrator , appearing both against traditional moral values and family .\nIronically , the name Marla Singer reminds one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the highly controversial and allegedly fiendish proponent of the eugenics movement .\nSociopolitical issues concerning gender reverberate throughout Fight Club .\nThe engineering efforts of the Royal Institute for Internal Affairs in London , as well as their American Doppleganger the Council for Foreign Relations is palpable .\nSimilarly , we \u2019 re reminded of so-called feminist icons such as Gloria Steinem who spied for the CIA , an agency with ties to the international banking cartel .\nIt has long been acknowledged that the cult-hit story Fight Club was inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society .\nThe Cacophony , were a troupe of members known for their absurd situationist anarchism , foolish pranks and surreal sabotage .\nWhether through the improvised culture-jamming of Santarchy , where drunken members pose as Santa or propelling a protest , the aim was clear , the group was to disrupt cultural norms .\nThe Cacophony Society ( CS ) is most known for bringing Burning Man to the Black Rock Desert .\nThe annual Burning Man festival has been under FBI surveillance since at least 2010 .\nCS has other chapters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was borrowed for Fight Club .\nBehind the seemingly innocuous premise of CS , was the San Francisco Suicide Club ( SFSC ) , another anarchic group spawned from the Situationist \u2019 s of the 1950-1970 \u2019 s .\nThe Situationist \u2019 s were heavily influenced by Dada , Surrealism and Marxism .\nFrench social psychologist Gustave Le Bon , outlined a scientific process to understand not only the group mind but how we might look at today \u2019 s flash mobs or social justice movements and beyond in the revealing book entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Popular Mind.\n\u201d In the influential book , Le Bon explains the various ways a participant may be spurned into group action .\nThis study of mass behavior confirmed that the group has different mental characteristics to that of the individual and is moved primarily by impulse and emotion .\nThrough different appeals by the propagandist , we see the emotional push of the masses .\nThis can be used in political regime changes via a color revolution or through more modern culture-jamming agitprop to propel a different outcome .\nDuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill incident this past year , there appeared to be a mixture of provocateurs among the throngs of people staging in the area with those that were unknowing participants in the mass event .\nWith Le Bon \u2019 s analysis in mind , we can see how a shift in the hive mind could alter the pulse of a protest .\nLebon illustrated that \u201c He [ an individual ] is no longer himself , but has become an automaton who has ceased to be guided by his will , \u201d when seduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With this in mind , whether something is observed to be a potential false flag or staged event , even the unknowing could become useful pawns .\nIn late August of 2021 , it was revealed that the FBI found \u201c scant evidence \u201d the Capitol Hill event following the US Presidential election was a coordinated attack .\nIn addition , it was stated that the FBI had numerous operatives at the controversial event on the US Capitol .\nFlash forward to this past month , the Justice for J6 Rally appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-opted by the establishment in an effort to further bolster calls for a crackdown on dissent .\nWhether in the flesh , social media or through mainstream TV , the populace is routinely subjected to various forms of hyperreal propaganda the world over .\nThe cinematic presence of Fight Club is no different , as the alluring and illusory film paints a picture of subversion that hypnotizes the viewer through societal foreknowledge exemplified in the revelation of the method .\nUltimately , Fight Club is indelibly wrought with manifestations of Marxist revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributor John the Revelator specializes in the deconstruction and analysis of high-profile world events , books , film and TV .\nREAD MORE WAR ON TERROR NEWS AT : 21st Century Wire War On Terror", "author": "John the Revelator",

serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ( S ) antibodies declined rapidly in the first 4 months after infection and then more gradually over the following 7 months , remaining detectable at least 11 months after infection .\nAnti-S antibody titres correlated with the frequency of S-specific plasma cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had recovered from COVID-19 at 7 to 8 months after infection .\nS-specific

Bush \u2019 s War on Terror and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics of the U.S. and its foreign policy under Bush ( and Obama ) .\nThere are those who say that it was no coincidence that the Twin Towers and the Pentagon were hit , suspecting that the PNAC and the Bush administration had prior knowledge of the plot , or were even involved in the planning and execution of the attacks .\nThe U.S. authorities have since then employed the events of 11 September to justify the imposition of the Patriot Act to curtail the public \u2019 s freedom domestically and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personified in the figure of the now-defunct Osama bin Laden ( variously spelled and abbreviated as OBL ) and a shadowy organisation known as Al Qaeda ( the base in Arabic ) .\nThese audacious terror attacks using airplanes as deadly missiles \u2013 in New York , Washington D.C. and in a field near Shanksville , Pennsylvania \u2013 have largely determined the course of the early 21st century .\nFollowing the end of the Cold War and the discovery of the \u2018 Muslim Extremist \u2019 as NATO \u2019 s new chosen enemy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George W. Bush \u2019 s global War on Terror turned the political scientist Dr Samuel Huntington ( 1927-2008 ) \u2019 s suggestion of a \u201c clash of civilizations \u201d into a deadly reality .\nThe mountainous country of Afghanistan became the first battleground in this unholy \u201c clash.\n\u201d On 12 September 2001 , President Bush spoke these programmatic words that managed to change reality and give history a definite Huntingtonesque turn : Invading Afghanistan to Capture Baghdad : Pipelineistan or a Sea of Oil ?\nOn 13 November 2001 , the BBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson somewhat boastfully made the following claim : \u201c [ i ] t was only BBC people who liberated this city .\nWe got in ahead of Northern Alliance troops , \u201d freeing the Afghan capital Kabul from the iconoclastic clutches of the Taliban .\nAdmittedly , Simpson subsequently realised the folly of his words and somewhat retracted his bold statement .\nFor , the U.S. Army acting on orders of President George W. Bush had done the conquering and liberating in response to the 9/11 attacks \u2013 G.I .\nJoe versus \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. military campaign in the Hindu Kush codenamed Operation Enduring Freedom began on 7 October 2001 .\nA dedicated U.S. State Department website boastfully yet somewhat deceitfully claims that \u201c [ i ] n just weeks the [ U.S. ] military essentially destroyed al-Qaeda \u2019 s grip on Afghanistan by driving the Taliban from power.\n\u201d Though in hindsight the U.S. attack on Afghanistan might appear counter-intuitive , as the original terror attacks had been carried out by 19 Arabs and not 19 Afghans \u2013 including fifteen Saudi citizens , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emirates , and 1 from Lebanon , and another one from Egypt ( \u201c Mohamed Atta \u201d ) .\nThe latter \u2019 s presence and complicity was notably important , for \u201c less than a week \u201d following the collapse of the Twin Towers , \u201c Atta \u2019 s passport \u201d was discovered in the rubble of Ground Zero ( the name given to the site where the Twin Towers once stood ) , in an incredible turn of serendipity .\nIn early 2002 , the journalist Anne Karpf mused that \u201c [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blizzard of paper rain down from the towers [ on our television screens ] , but the idea that Atta \u2019 s passport had escaped from that inferno unsinged would have tested the credulity of the staunchest supporter of the FBI \u2019 s crackdown on terrorism , \u201d yet that was the tall tale to be unquestioningly accepted subsequently .\nAnd as a result , Osama bin Laden , whom Bill Clinton had elevated to the status of Public Enemy No .\n1 in 1998 , was quickly singled out as the mastermind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Hindu Kush enjoying the hospitality and protection of the beard-wielding Taliban .\nPreviously , Bin Laden had been a staunch U.S. ally and operative , aiding in the Brzesinki-induced fight ( or \u2018 Jihad \u2019 ) pitting the Mujahideen against the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s \u2013 the name Al Qaeda referring to an organisational hub headed by Bin Laden seems to have been first used on 11 August 1988 , according to the author Dr Philippe Migaux ( cfr .\nthe 2007 book The History of Terrorism : From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush administration singled out Bin Laden and his shadowy organization as the major culprits and the 19 Arab suicide attackers as his henchmen and Al Qaeda operatives .\nHence , the Bush-declared War-on-Terror \u2019 s first object became the mountainous land known as Afghanistan : a nation as artificial as any other nation state on earth , harbouring a plethora of peoples and languages \u2013 \u201c Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual country .\n.\n.\nIn Article 4 of Afghanistan \u2019 s [ 2004 C ] onstitution , 14 ethnic groups are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uzbek , Turkman , Baluch , Pachaie , Nuristani , Aymaq , Arab , Qirghiz , Qizilbash , Gujur , Brahwui and Other Tribes , \u201d as expressed by the independent researcher and consultant , Meetra Qutb .\nA result of the fact that the country \u2019 s borders were actually \u201c drawn by Britain and czarist Russia during the onset of [ the ] \u2018 Great Game \u2019 in Central Asia in the closing decades of the 19th century .\n.\n.\n[ borders that ] were gerrymandered to split members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring states , \u201d in the words of anthropologist Dr Nazif Shahrani .\nFurthermore , the Afghan Constitution \u2019 s Article 4 also stipulates that the \u201c word Afghan shall apply to each and every citizen of Afghanistan , \u201d residing within those borders .\nIn this context , it has to be understood that the religion of Islam is meant to provide the ideological glue holding the diverse ethnic ( and/or linguistic ) groups together .\nThe Bush administration picked the many-splendoured yet deeply Muslim country in the Hindu Kush as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9/11 appeared obvious .\nThe decision to invade Afghanistan , though , seems to have been the earlier \u201c brainchild of a number of experts during a \u2018 4-day [ mid-July 2001 ] Berlin meeting carrying the heading \u2018 Brainstorming on Afghanistan \u2019 and [ that ] was apparently the outcome of the Clinton administration \u2019 s concerns over Osama bin Laden , \u2019 going back to the 1998 attacks on two US embassies in Africa \u2013 in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi.\n\u201d And any number of economic and monetary concerns can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TAPI pipeline angle in my tenth 9/11 anniversary piece , published in a now no longer extant newspaper .\nWhile , the always astute and eloquent Pepe Escobar also spoke about the \u201c high-stakes , hardcore geopolitical game that follows what flows along the pipelines of the planet , \u201d in connection with the Bush invasion of Afghanistan .\nBut Junior or Dubya wasn \u2019 t really all that concerned with \u201c pursuing the New Great Game on the \u2018 oddly shaped Eurasian chessboard \u2019 , \u201d as coined by Brzezinki in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush-Cheney gruesome twosome was \u201c quick to abandon the mission [ in the Hindu Kush ] in order to go into Iraq \u2013 that profitable country which \u2018 floats on a sea of oil , \u2019 as poetically promised by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz ( 2001-5 ) .\n\u201d Not quite three months after the \u201c New Pearl Harbor , \u201d Peter Beaumont , Ed Vulliamy and Paul Beaver wrote in The Observer that \u201c America intends to depose Saddam Hussein by giving armed support to Iraqi opposition forces

Bill Gates is Now America\u2019s Biggest Farmland Owner", "content": "This article was previously published January 25 , 2021 , and has been updated with new information .\nKnowledge is power .\nSo is ownership , including land ownership .\nDid you know that Bill Gates is America \u2019 s top farmland investor ?\nThis short video reveals many of the global strategies Gates has been using to influence your health and the food supply .\nThrough his founding of the second-largest technological company in the world,1 Gates has developed financial and influential relationships with powerful organizations responsible for many global decisions that affect your life .\nSubtly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have grown a massive financial empire and expanded his ability to create change to support his goals .\nGates is also a supporter of the \u201c Great Reset \u201d that promises \u201c social cohesion , fairness , inclusion and equality , \u201d 2 while allowing elite billionaires to practice strategies that grew his and other billionaires \u2019 wealth by 26 % during the pandemic in 2020.3 In other words , while supporting Marxist principles to spread the wealth \u2014 so by 2030 you can say , \u201c I Own Nothing , Have No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d 4 \u2014 he is enjoying the fruits of his labor by accumulating more wealth and property , a decidedly different approach to the Great Reset he promotes .\nPut plainly , the political and ideological foundations of Marxism have once again surfaced , and in some arenas , are celebrated .\nHowever , it \u2019 s vital to remember that unlike Walgreens \u2019 advertising campaign featuring a picture-perfect town of \u201c Perfect , \u201d 5 Marxist philosophy has created tyranny and was responsible for the deaths of more than 100 million people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described by James Bovard in USA Today.6 History is studied and shared so the mistakes of the past are not repeated .\nHowever , it \u2019 s evident there are many who have forgotten , or never learned , what resulted behind the Iron Curtain from implementing the socialist principles which now underpin The Great Reset .\nThe Great Reset or Fourth Industrial Revolution has strong supporters among wealthy technocrats who will not redistribute their own wealth , but will only continue to grow their financial empires as the rest of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a taste of what could come as more people lose their jobs and financial security , while those controlling the event become wealthier .\nBill Gates Is Now the Biggest Farmland Owner The Land Report announced that multibillionaire Bill Gates currently holds the title as America \u2019 s biggest private farmland owner .\nHe owns 242,000 acres , nearly 52,000 more than the next largest farmland owner.7 To put this in perspective , 52,000 is equal to 39,325 football fields , including the end zones.8 His farmland ( approximately 378.125 square miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the eighth largest city in the U.S. in 2010.9 It was Eric O \u2019 Keefe from the Land Report10 who ferreted out the story after reading that 14,500 acres of choice farmland in Benton County , Washington , had been sold for $ 171 million , or nearly $ 12,000 per acre .\nO \u2019 Keefe describes the area as \u201c some of the richest farmland in the Lower 48 , \u201d that \u201c savvy investors have been plowing millions of dollars into.\n\u201d 11 Although the seller was listed as John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported as a limited liability company from Louisiana .\nDigging deeper and engaging their research team , he discovered the paper trail led to a company managed by Michael Larson , manager of the Gates \u2019 personal portfolio and much of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the last 25 years .\nLarson primarily uses Cascade Investment LLC as the entity through which he manages their personal portfolio .\nO \u2019 Keefe details the sequence in which the land changed hands over 10 years .\nThe largest single block of farmland was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year after it was purchased by a Canadian firm.12 The sale was revealed in the Canadian firm \u2019 s quarterly statement , in which they reported offloading $ 520 million in farmland offered in a single block .\nAn investigative journalist ultimately found the half-billion-dollar sale led to Cascade Investment LLC .\nGates Is Not the Largest Individual Landowner Gates owns a substantial amount of land , for a total of 268,894 acres if you count his transitional and recreational properties .\nBut , he \u2019 s not the only billionaire who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lynda Resnick , co-founders of Wonderful Company , come in at No .\n2 , owning 190,000 acres .\nThey use their farmland to support their food products , such as Wonderful Pistachios and Wonderful Halos Mandarin oranges.13 Gates also is not the largest individual landowner overall , as that spot goes to John Malone , chairman of the board at Liberty Media Corporation and former chief executive officer for Tele-Communications Inc.14 Malone owns 2.2 million acres of forest and ranch land ; media Mogul Ted Turner owns 2 million across eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily invested in land , coming in the 25th spot at 420,000 acres located mostly in Texas.16 The remaining list is filled with recognizable names , including the King Ranch , Ford family and the Kennedy Memorial Foundation.17 In addition to farmland , Cascade Investment has purchased 24,800 acres of transitional property west of Phoenix , which is poised for city expansion projected to include : \u201c up to 80,000 homes ; 3,800 acres of industrial , office and retail space ; 3,400 acres of open space ; and 470 acres for public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreational acres , making the land Gates owns through just Cascade Investment LLC at 268,984 acres .\nSeparate from the Gates \u2019 personal holdings is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , which has no ties to Cascade , but does have a farmland initiative called Gates Ag One , which19 \u201c \u2026 aims to speed up efforts to provide smallholder farmers in developing countries , many of whom are women , with access to the affordable tools and innovations they need to sustainably improve crop productivity and adapt to the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvest Standard ?\nAlthough Cascade Investment has declined to make any comment on the quiet transactions through the Canadian company , they have come out in support of sustainable farming .\nOne of the entities owned by Cascade , Cottonwood Ag Management , is an initial member of Leading Harvest , a nonprofit organization formed to advance:20 \u201c \u2026 sustainable agriculture , providing assurance programs comprised of standards , audit procedures , training and education , and reporting and claim offerings that are optimized for flexibility , scalability , and impact.\n\u201d As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is to create a \u201c sustainability standard that can be implemented across the greatest swath of agricultural acreage.\n\u201d 21 Yet , while this goal is commendable , they remain words on paper without a substantive foundation .\nIn other words , according to the organization , they do not offer farmers guidance to achieve the goal , only the formation of a certification program to audit the farmers \u2019 results.22 In their publication , they describe the program:23 \u201c It does not prescribe practices necessary to conform with the Standard ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm managers the flexibility to select best practices for sustainable outcomes .\nThis approach allows for adaptation across crops and geographies , recognizing that even a single crop can require unique management strategies in different regions .\nAn outcome-based approach recognizes that prescribing the same processes and metrics across geographies can be ineffective .\nBy encouraging farmers to innovate new approaches and apply best management practices suited for their crops and consistent with regional best practices , management results are improved , and greater sustainability outcomes are achieved.\n\u201d In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmer achieves sustainability and protects the future of farming , they created a certification for farmers to demonstrate their participation in developing practices where the end result meets their standard \u2014 do the ends justify the means ?\nGates Seeking Sustainable Energy in All the Wrong Places Gates has been calling for sustainable energy and a reduction of carbon emissions for over a decade.24 At one point in a 2010 TED talk , he questioned if we need another Manhattan Project to discover a renewable and safe energy source .\nIf you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project was the code name given to an operation aimed at discovering a functional nuclear weapon,25 that resulted in a bomb being dropped on Hiroshima , Japan .\nWhen asked how he would deal with climate change skeptics , he said:26 \u201c The main problem we have here \u2014 it \u2019 s kind of like with AIDS : You make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .\nAnd so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a somewhat uncertain pain thing.\n\u201d Gates spoke about climate change and the technological advancements that may be necessary in an interview with a journalist from The Atlantic in 2015 .\nThe journalist recorded this response:27 \u201c Yes , the government will be somewhat inept , \u201d he said brusquely , swatting aside one objection as a trivial statement of the obvious .\n\u201c But the private sector is in general inept .\nHow many companies do venture capitalists invest in that go poorly ?\nBy far most of them.\n\u201d While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government or entrepreneurs , he does believe that plant-based and lab-grown meat alternatives are healthy and sustainable .\nHistorically , some of the decisions from the Gates Foundation haven \u2019 t been focused on the environment but , rather , cloaked in rhetoric that appears environmentally friendly .\nFor example , despite a lack of consensus on GMO safety,28 in 2010 the Gates Foundation aligned itself with Monsanto and Cargill .\nThey invested nearly $ 23 million in 500,000 Monsanto shares .\nSubsequently , a South African watchdog group discovered the Gates Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cargill to \u201c develop the soya value chain , \u201d 29 which The Guardian wrote probably meant the \u201c big time introduction of GM soy in southern Africa.\n\u201d 30 In 2010 , The Guardian also reported that Gates had funded research to develop machines that would spray seawater into the clouds with the goal of increasing the ability to reflect sunlight into space , and therefore reduce global warming .\nThe move triggered a call for a global ban on geoengineering experiments from the ETC Group and a comment from co-executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing cloud applications for computers but we didn \u2019 t expect this .\nBill Gates and his cloud-wrenching cronies have no right to unilaterally change our seas and skies in this way.\n\u201d Not to be deterred by naysayers , eight years later in 2018 Gates agreed to help fund experiments for Harvard scientists , who proposed to spray the stratosphere with calcium chloride to help slow the Earth \u2019 s warming.32 In keeping with past decisions , Gates also supports plant-based and lab-grown meat alternatives,33,34 which are riddled with patented chemicals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soil4Climate , characterizes one fake-meat product this way:35 \u201c Impossible Foods should really be called Impossible Patents .\nIt \u2019 s not food ; it \u2019 s software , intellectual property \u2014 14 patents , in fact , in each bite of Impossible Burger with over 100 additional patents pending for animal proxies from chicken to fish .\nIt \u2019 s iFood , the next killer app .\nJust download your flavor .\nThis is likely the appeal for Bill Gates , their \u00fcber investor.\n\u201d Presumably , his support of chemical food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better things for better living through chemistry , \u201d 36 is to reduce carbon emissions .\nHowever , as has been documented and covered in other articles I \u2019 ve written , regenerative farming practices are better for the land , the animals and your health .\nYour Health Depends on Whole Food Convinced that their method of producing chemical-based food reduces the carbon footprint , Impossible Foods hired Quantis to give them scientific evidence.37 According to the executive summary published on their website , their product reduces the environmental impact between 87 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quantis studied , including global warming potential , land occupation and water consumption .\nHowever , Quantis compared fake meat production against CAFOs , which are notoriously destructive .\nOn the other hand , White Oak Pastures in Bluffton , Georgia , practices true sustainable , regenerative farming and produces high-quality , grass fed products .\nWhite Oak Pastures commissioned the same analysis , by the same company , which showed they had a net total emission in the negative numbers.38 It \u2019 s also worth noting that the Impossible Burger is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and longevity are dependent on providing your body with necessary nutrients from whole food .\nIt \u2019 s simply impossible to be sustained by synthetic chemicals , toxic GMO grains contaminated with pesticides and fake meat .\nRegenerative farming practices can provide whole food and can have a positive impact on the environment .\nImagine the powerful influence Gates could have on the environment and the country if he would move his massive acreage into regenerative farming practices .\nThis could raise the quality of food the land produces and demonstrate sustainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world .\nInstead , it appears that financial motivations are helping to drive environmental decisions to support his personal goals .\nAs I \u2019 ve discussed in other articles , the movement to develop fake food is lucrative .\nHowever , you can protect your health and your future by starting with a few simple guidelines that include always choosing organic foods , buying from local farmers and never eating processed foods of any sort .\nReally Graceful provides

.\nIndeed , the global economy may be the greatest illusionary trick ever pulled over the eyes of people around the world .\nTo understand what \u2019 s really going on , watch Tim Gielen \u2019 s hour-long documentary , \u201c MONOPOLY : Who Owns the World ?\n\u201d ( see below ) .\nAs noted by Gielen , who narrates the film , a handful of mega corporations \u2014 private investment companies \u2014 dominate every aspect of our lives ; everything we eat , drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another .\nThese investment firms are so enormous , they control the money flow worldwide .\nSo , how does this scheme work ?\nWhile there appear to be hundreds of competing brands on the market , like Russian nesting dolls , larger parent companies own multiple smaller brands .\nIn reality , all packaged food brands , for example , are owned by a dozen or so larger parent companies .\nPepsi Co. owns a long list of food , beverage and snack brands , as does Coca-Cola , Nestle , General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mars , Kraft Heinz , Mondelez , Danone and Associated British Foods .\nTogether , these parent companies monopolize the packaged food industry , as virtually every food brand available belongs to one of them .\nThese companies are publicly traded and are run by boards , where the largest shareholders have power over the decision making .\nThis is where it gets interesting , because when you look up who the largest shareholders are , you find yet another monopoly .\nWhile the topmost shareholders can change from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two companies are consistently listed among the top institutional holders of these parent companies : The Vanguard Group Inc. and Blackrock Inc. Pepsi and Coca-Cola \u2014 An Example For example , while there are more than 3,000 shareholders in Pepsi Co. , Vanguard and Blackrock \u2019 s holdings account for nearly one-third of all shares .\nOf the top 10 shareholders in Pepsi Co. , the top three , Vanguard , Blackrock and State Street Corporation , own more shares than the remaining seven .\nNow , let \u2019 s look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitor .\nWho owns Coke ?\nAs with Pepsi , the majority of the company shares are held by institutional investors , which number 3,155 ( as of the making of the documentary ) .\nAs shown in the film , three of the top four institutional shareholders of Coca-Cola are identical with that of Pepsi : Vanguard , Blackrock and State Street Corporation .\nThe No .\n1 shareholder of Coca-Cola is Berkshire Hathaway Inc .\nThese four \u2014 Vanguard , Blackrock , State Street and Berkshire Hathaway \u2014 are the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c So , Pepsi and Coca-Cola are anything but competitors , \u201d Gielen says .\nAnd the same goes for the other packaged food companies .\nAll are owned by the same small group of institutional shareholders .\nThe monopoly of these investment firms isn \u2019 t relegated to the packaged food industry .\nYou find them dominating virtually all other industries as well .\nTake Big Tech , for example .\nAmong the top 10 largest tech companies we find Apple , Samsung , Alphabet ( parent company of Google ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sony .\nHere , we find the same Russian nesting doll setup .\nFor example , Facebook owns Whatsapp and Instagram .\nAlphabet owns Google and all Google-related businesses , including YouTube and Gmail .\nIt \u2019 s also the biggest developer of Android , the main competitor to Apple .\nMicrosoft owns Windows and Xbox .\nIn all , four parent companies produce the software used by virtually all computers , tablets and smartphones in the world .\nWho , then , owns them ?\nHere \u2019 s a sampling : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Facebook shares are held by institutional investors , and the top institutional holders are the same as those found in the food industry : Vanguard and Blackrock being the top two , as of the end of March 2021 .\nState Street Corporation is the fifth biggest shareholder \u2022 Apple \u2014 The top four institutional investors are Vanguard , Blackrock , Berkshire Hathaway and State Street Corporation \u2022 Microsoft \u2014 The top three institutional shareholders are Vanguard , Blackrock and State Street Corporation You can continue going through the list of tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart phones , electronics and household appliances \u2014 and you \u2019 ll repeatedly find Vanguard , Blackrock , Berkshire Hathaway and State Street Corporation among the top shareholders .\nSame Small Group Owns Everything Else Too The same ownership trend exists in all other industries .\nGielen offers yet another example to prove this statement is not an exaggeration : The same goes for the agricultural industry that the global food industry depends on , and any other major industry .\nThese institutional investors own Bayer , the world \u2019 s largest seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers and many of the largest clothing companies .\nThey own the oil refineries , the largest solar panel producers and the automobile , aircraft and arms industries .\nThey own all the major tobacco companies , and all the major drug companies and scientific institutes too .\nThey also own the big department stores and the online marketplaces like eBay , Amazon and AliExpress .\nThey even own the payment methods we use , from credit card companies to digital payment platforms , as well as insurance companies , banks , construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personal care brands and cosmetic brands .\nNo matter what industry you look at , the top shareholders , and therefore decision makers , are the same : Vanguard , Blackrock , State Street and/or Berkshire Hathaway .\nIn virtually every major company , you find these names among the top 10 institutional investors .\nWho Owns the Investment Firms of the World ?\nDiving deeper , we find that these major investment firms are in turn owned by their own set of shareholders .\nOne of the most amazing things about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 and there are many more than the primary four we \u2019 ve focused on here \u2014 also own each other .\nThey \u2019 re all shareholders in each other \u2019 s companies .\n\u201c Together , they form an immense network that we can compare to a pyramid , \u201d Gielen says .\nSmaller institutional investors , such as Citibank , ING and T. Rowe Price , are owned by larger investment firms such as Northern Trust , Capital Group , 3G Capital and KKR .\nThose investors in turn are owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldman Sachs and Wellington Market , which are owned by larger firms yet , such as Berkshire Hathaway and State Street .\nAt the top of the pyramid \u2014 the largest Russian doll of all \u2014 we find Vanguard and Blackrock .\nGielen cites data from Bloomberg , showing that by 2028 , Vanguard and BlackRock are expected to collectively manage $ 20 trillion-worth of investments .\nIn the process , they will own almost everything on planet Earth .\nBloomberg has also referred to BlackRock as the \u201c fourth branch of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the central banks .\nBlackRock actually lends money to the central bank , the federal reserve , and is their principal adviser .\nDozens of BlackRock employees have held senior positions in the White House under the Bush , Obama and Biden administrations .\nBlackRock also developed the computer system that the central banks use .\nWhile Larry Fink is the figurehead of BlackRock , being its founder , chairman and chief executive officer , he \u2019 s not the sole decision maker , as BlackRock too is owned by shareholders .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the largest shareholder of BlackRock is Vanguard .\n\u201c This is where it gets dark , \u201d Gielen says .\nVanguard has a unique structure that blocks us from seeing who the actual shareholders are .\n\u201c The elite who own Vanguard don \u2019 t want anyone to know they are the owners of the most powerful company on earth.\n\u201d Still , if you dig deep enough , you can find clues as to who these owners are .\nThe owners of the wealthiest , most powerful company on Earth can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals on earth .\nIn 2016 , Oxfam reported that the combined wealth of the richest 1 % in the world was equal to the wealth of the remaining 99 % .\nIn 2018 , it was reported that the world \u2019 s richest people get 82 % of all the money earned around the world in 2017 .\nIn reality , we can assume that the owners of Vanguard are among the 0.001 % richest people on the planet .\nAccording to Forbes , there were 2,075 billionaires in the world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data showing that two-thirds of billionaires obtained their fortunes via inheritance , monopoly and/or cronyism .\n\u201c This means that Vanguard is in the hands of the richest families on earth , \u201d Gielen says .\nAmong them we find the Rothschilds , the DuPont family , the Rockefellers , the Bush family and the Morgan family , just to

swing state .\nCognitively impaired nursing home residents in Wisconsin and Michigan cynically exploited for votes .\nElection mismanagement in Atlanta .\nUnlawful election instructions in Wisconsin .\nAnd 50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal cases for illegal ballot harvesting and inmate voting .\nEleven months after Donald Trump was ousted from office , the narrative that the 2020 election was clean and secure has frayed like a well-worn shoelace .\nThe challenges of the COVID pandemic , the aggressive new tactics of voting activists and the desire of Democrats to make the collection and delivery of ballots by third parties legal in states where harvesting is expressly forbidden has muddied the establishment portrait and awakened the nation to the painful reality its election system \u2014 particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from perfection .\nNowhere has that story become more clear than the battleground state of Wisconsin , where a local sheriff on Thursday dramatically held a nationally televised news conference alleging he had found evidence of felony crimes involving ballots sent to nursing home residents .\nRacine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling said his investigators have secured evidence that eight out of 42 residents at a local nursing home had been recorded as casting absentee ballots that their families said was not possible because the residents didn \u2019 t possess the cognitive ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one family who discovered their loved one had voted in the November 2020 election despite having died a month earlier after a long period of mental decline , authorities said .\nSchmaling dramatically accused the Wisconsin Elections Commission , the state \u2019 s election bureaucracy , of creating the conditions for such voting by mailing absentee ballots to nursing home residents who didn \u2019 t request them and empowering nursing home staff to fill out ballots on behalf of the residents .\nThe \u201c election statute was in fact not just broken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nursing home scheme alleged by Schmaling was also found in neighboring Michigan , where Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel earlier this month announced three women were charged with voting fraud , including one who fraudulently filled out ballots in the names of nursing home residents without their permission .\nBut the nursing home case is far from the only concern that has rocked Wisconsin , where Joe Biden was certified the winner over Trump with a razor-thin margin of about 20,000 votes .\nThe non-partisan Legislative Audit Bureau released a sweeping report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging in \u201c inconsistent administration \u201d of election laws , troublesome management of new drop boxes used to collect ballots during the pandemic , ineffective investigation of fraud complaints , and other problems .\nWhile it did not offer evidence of systemic fraud , it flagged more than 30 problems as well as many more issues that lawmakers should resolve for future elections .\nYou can read that report here : The report prompted the GOP leader of the Wisconsin Senate to launch an investigation into the November election , augmenting a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is being led by former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman .\nAnd those developments follow a ruling by the Wisconsin Supreme Court that concluded state election officials wrongly allowed tens of thousands of Wisconsin voters to skip voter ID requirements and file absentee ballots by declaring their concerns about COVID made them \u201c indefinitely confined.\n\u201d While the court ruled the advice was illegal , it noted there was no penalty and said it was up to voters to decide if they had an infirmity or disability that made them confined @ @

Ron Johnson ( R-Wisc . )\nthe former chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , which oversees elections , said the dizzying revelations coming from his own state were a clear sign that lawmakers have far more work ahead of them to improve election administration and ensure voters are treated more evenly .\n\u201c Following the LAB report , what Sheriff Schmaling has uncovered +

significant problems administering the November election , so much so that state officials have begun the process of taking the county \u2019 s election management into receivership , removing local control for the 2022 election and beyond .\nThat dramatic move came after Just the News unearthed a 29-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials in Futon County engaged in all sorts of misconduct and mistakes , including insecure transport of ballots , double scanning of ballots and possible invasions of voter privacy .\nAnd earlier this month , two Fulton County workers were fired for allegedly shredding

and Deliver: How to Fight Vaccine Mandates and Passports", "content": "Around the world , huge numbers of people are protesting vaccine mandates and passports .\nIn mid-September 2021 , Italy became the first European country to announce the implementation of mandatory COVID-19 health passes ( so-called \u201c Green Pass \u201d ) for all workers , both public and private .\nThe Italian mandate took effect October 15 , 2021 .\nUnder the new rules , any Italian who does not have a Green Pass is forced into unpaid leave and risks fines of up to 1,500 euros ( approximately $ 1,750 ) .\nMassive demonstrations are also taking place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , Romania , Slovenia , Australia and France .\nEven in Israel , mass protests are now taking place as it was announced Israelis will lose their health pass privileges unless they get a third booster shot six months after their second dose .\nNew York City has also seen large protests in the wake of its vaccine requirement for restaurants and other public venues .\nAmong those protesting are firefighters , first responders , correctional officers , police officers and sanitation workers .\nThe New York City police union , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city over its COVID jab mandate , saying it opposes any mandate that does not allow police officers to undergo weekly testing in lieu of getting the shot .\nAs of mid-October 2021 , an estimated 30 % of the New York police department remained unvaccinated.1 Unless they \u2019 re fully \u201c vaccinated \u201d by November 1 , 2021 , they all face being placed on unpaid leave .\nIn all , about 46,0002 New York city workers stand before this difficult choice : get the risky jab or lose their job .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain unvaccinated.3 We \u2019 ve already seen how mass walkouts can change things .\nFor example , in mid-October 2021 , Southwest Airlines did a sudden U-turn , reversing its strict get jabbed or get lost policy.4 Southwest is now urging unvaccinated employees to apply for an exemption , which the airline will do its best to approve .\nIn cases where an exemption is not approved , Southwest has promised to provide other accommodation , such as weekly testing , which is not an option under Biden \u2019 s mandate .\nNow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York City would do .\nI predict a few weeks of letting trash pile up might soften the mayor \u2019 s stance on the mandate .\nIt would be even more catastrophic \u2014 and more likely to end the mandate \u2014 were the remaining vaccinated sanitation workers to walk off the job in solidarity .\nAfter all , whether you decided to get the initial jab or not , the vaccine mandate is a direct attack on your personal freedom and liberty .\nUnless you \u2019 re willing to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to say no to this clear authoritarian overreach , because it \u2019 s only going to get worse from here .\nThere really is no telling what you \u2019 ll have to submit yourself to next in order to keep your \u201c privileges , \u201d which now include having a job .\nThe Global Threat of Vaccine Mandates and Passports In the video above , investigative reporter James Corbett of The Corbett Report Solution Watch explores how we can thwart the threat of vaccine mandates and passports .\nAs noted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There \u2019 s not a nation in the world that can expect to not face vaccine mandates and passports , for the simple reason that the passports are a foundational part of the new economic control system that is being rolled out .\nSo , while it appears people have successfully pushed back in some areas \u2014 including the U.K. , which recently announced it would scrap the passport requirement for restaurants and other public venues , and in Florida , where Gov .\nRon DeSantis is calling on businesses to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see his speech below ) \u2014 we must remain vigilant , not let up , and not give an inch .\nWe \u2019 ve repeatedly seen how government officials have said there are no plans for vaccine mandates or passports , only to turn on a dime days or weeks later .\nIt seems they \u2019 re all using the same playbook : First , put people \u2019 s minds at ease , and then pull the rug out \u2014 over and over again .\nHow to Thwart the Threat of Vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one-size-fits-all solution , some general suggestions can be made .\nCorbett divides the available solutions into four main categories : 1 .\nLegal challenges to the vaccine mandates \u2014 A variety of legal resources can be found on The Corbett Report \u2019 s September Open Thread.5 A thread by HomeRemedySupply , in particular , contains a long list of legal resources for Americans looking to combat vaccine mandates , including vaccine exemption documents and much more .\nThe Corbett Report show notes6 also list a variety of resources .\nAnother resource is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ download a variety of forms , including : a .\nA family financial disclosure form , to ensure that a vaccine injury or death does not translate into financial destruction of the whole family b .\nAn employer disclosure form that informs your employer of the many laws and ethical principles they are breaking and demands they take financial responsibility for any injury you might incur as a result of their mandate c. A school disclosure form that informs the school of the many laws and ethical principles they are breaking and demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might incur as a result of their mandate d. A notice of parental authority form , which parents can use to notify relevant parties that they do not consent to their child being vaccinated without their written informed consent Another type of legal challenge you can pursue is that of religious and medical exemptions .\nJust keep in mind that while this might temporarily save the livelihoods of some , it does virtually nothing to protect you or anyone else from tyranny in the long term .\nAnd , as noted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious exemptions denied by bureaucrats who say they don \u2019 t think the Amish have a strongly held religious conviction against vaccination .\nIf you know anything about Amish who choose not to vaccinate , you know what a ridiculous statement that is , but at the end of the day , these are the kinds of people making the decisions .\n2 .\nWorkarounds that don \u2019 t necessitate facing the problem head-on \u2014 This includes setting up a network of likeminded people to create parallel economies and resources,7 and getting involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s school board and so on , where you can apply pressure and affect change from the inside .\nYou can also sign petitions , such as the British togetherdeclaration.org.8 3 .\nPeaceful protests and demonstrations \u2014 As mentioned earlier , there are mass protests taking place all over the world .\nKeep in mind that this strategy requires patience and above all persistence .\nDoing it once or twice will accomplish little .\nThe French have been taken to the streets by the hundreds of thousands every weekend for months .\nOur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swayed by these displays of solidarity but , over time , peaceful protests can be effective .\n4 .\nThe ultimate solution : noncompliance \u2014 At the end of the day , the most effective long-term solution is mass noncompliance , \u201c ignoring the rulers out of existence , \u201d to quote Arizona Dara , featured in Corbett \u2019 s report .\nIt \u2019 s important to realize that it \u2019 s not our politicians who are running the show .\nThey \u2019 re foot soldiers for unnamed , unelected globalists , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unlikely to eliminate this threat over the long term .\nAs noted by Corbett , the technocrat globalists that are the real string pullers are only able to do what they do because people tend to just go along with it .\nIt \u2019 s that simple .\nIf enough people don \u2019 t comply , their plans fall apart .\nIf millions of people refuse to comply with the mandates and the passports and then sue their employers when they \u2019 re fired , if millions force the establishment to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually cave .\nAs noted by Corbett , it would become mathematically impossible for them to enforce the tyranny .\nUltimately , that \u2019 s how we win .\nTo learn more about the scheme behind vaccine passports , read Jeremy Loffredo \u2019 s and Max Blumenthal \u2019 s article , \u201c Public Health or Private Wealth ?\nHow Digital Vaccine Passports Pave Way for Unprecedented Surveillance Capitalism.\n\u201d 9 As noted in that article : \u201c The titans of global capitalism are exploiting the Covid-19 crisis to institute social credit-style digital ID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by starvation of Etwariya Devi , a 67-year-old widow from the rural Indian state of Jharkhand , might have passed without notice had it not been part of a more widespread trend .\nLike 1.3 billion of her fellow Indians , Devi had been pushed to enroll in a biometric digital ID system called Aadhaar in order to access public services , including her monthly allotment of 25kg of rice .\nWhen her fingerprint failed to register with the shoddy system , Devi was denied her food ration .\nThroughout the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was repeatedly refused food until she succumbed to hunger , alone in her home .\nPremani Kumar , a 64-year-old woman also from Jharkhand , met the same demise as Devi , dying of hunger and exhaustion the same year after the Aadhaar system transferred her pension payments to another person without her permission , while cutting off her monthly food rations .\nA similarly cruel fate was reserved for Santoshi Kumari , an 11-year-old girl , also from Jharkhand , who reportedly died begging for rice after her family \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been linked to their Aadhaar digital ID .\nThese three heart-rending casualties were among a spate of deaths in rural India in 2017 which came as a direct result of the Aadhaar digital ID system .\nWith over one billion Indians in its database , Aadhaar is the largest biometric digital ID program ever constructed .\nBesides serving as a portal to government services , it tracks users \u2019 movements between cities , their employment status , and purchasing records .\nIt is a de facto social credit system that serves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India \u2026 For those yearning for an end to pandemic-related restrictions , credential programs certifying their vaccination against Covid-19 have been marketed as the key to reopening the economy and restoring their personal freedom .\nBut the implementation of immunity passports is also accelerating the establishment of a global digital identity infrastructure.\n\u201d Make no mistake , vaccine passports are the precursor to digital ID wallets , as noted by the military surveillance firm Thales.10 Of course , it \u2019 s sold as something that will provide you with superior convenience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it doesn \u2019 t always work , and even when it does , it turns you into a slave in a system that profits from surveilling everything you do .\nSooner or later , everyone will have to make a choice : Freedom or slavery .\nThere \u2019 s no middle ground anymore .\nThe system also gives unelected globalists \u2014 the richest of the rich \u2014 the power to cut your access to funds , health care , travel , food or anything else whenever they please .\nBill Gates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the World Bank and the World Economic Forum are just some of the people and organizations that are behind this global enslavement agenda .\nDon \u2019 t fall for altruistic language spouted by these people .\nIt \u2019 s nothing but PR to cover their profit motives .\nIn the real world , digital ID systems have proven disastrous for the average person , resulting in marginalization and death .\nIn India , a random sampling of 18 villages that had implemented compulsory biometric authentication at rationing stations showed a shocking 37 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their food rations for one reason or another.11 So much for convenience .\nImagine having to rely on a system like that for everything in your life \u2014 your food , your health care , your education , your banking and everyday purchases .\nAs noted by Canadian immunologist and geneticist Sir John Bell,12 the COVID-19 medical system can easily be repurposed for other ailments and health goals as well .\nAny number of other vaccinations could be mandated , and without having those logged in your passport , there goes your freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be required to maintain a valid passport .\nThey could put every adult over 40 on mandatory statin treatment , for example , as a public health measure .\nJust how much freedom are you willing to lose ?\nDon \u2019 t think for a minute that it \u2019 ll all end once you get fully vaccinated against COVID-19 .\nSooner or later , everyone will have to make a choice : freedom or slavery .\nThere \u2019 s no middle ground anymore .\nThis article is originally published at Mercola.com .\n@ @

obtained by means of abortions performed via the vagina : in both cases , the embryo will be contaminated by micro-organisms.\n\u201d \u201c The correct way consists in having recourse to Caesarian section or to the removal of the uterus .\nOnly in this way can bacteriological sterility be guaranteed.\n\u201d \u201c In either case , then , to obtain embryo cells for culture a programmed abortion

deliberate systematic destruction of a human creature to obtain cell material can be justified , when it is recognized that this is of great interest to fundamental research and for the diagnosis of some human diseases .\nAre research and diagnosis of such great value that they justify the destruction of human beings ?\n\u201d \u201c The Geneva Declaration affirms that the doctor has the duty to take the greatest care to safeguard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception and will not , even under threat , use his knowledge to infringe humanitarian laws.\n\u201d ( 1986-04-26 ; Herranz , Gonzalo ; Il Sabato , no.15\u2026Professor Herranz was , at the time , president of the Committee of Medical Ethics of Spanish Doctors and vice-president of the Permanent Committee of Medical Ethics of the European Community . )\nWhat exactly happened in 1972 or 1973 , in the Netherlands , where an infant girl was aborted , and her kidneys used to make a cell line that would be used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines ?\nThat cell line is called HEK 293 ( HEK stands for human embryonic kidney ) , and it has been used to test COVID vaccines .\nSEE ALSO : The Abortion Culture I have already presented evidence for concluding the abortion involved removing the living infant from her mother \u2019 s womb , and taking her kidneys , which of course killed her .\nThis evidence rests on the realization that , in order to extract viable and useful kidney tissue , the baby had to have a functioning blood supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the evidence ALSO comes from knowing many other abortions have been carried out , in order to harvest tissue for medical research , by murdering living babies .\nI have found a very informative article ( 2/9/2021 ) at the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform UK , by Christian Hacking , titled , \u201c What the HEK ?\n!\n\u201d by Christian Hacking .\nQuoting from the article : \u201c HEK 293 is a human cell line created using a kidney from a dissected unborn baby in the Netherlands between 1972 and 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell line and is used extensively in \u2018 pharmaceutical and biomedical research \u2019 .\nIt is also used in vaccine creation and cancer research.\n\u201d \u201c It was used , along with other human cell lines , to develop a genetically engineered spike protein ( that the mRNA vaccine codes for ) in the original development stage of the vaccine .\nThe \u2018 new technology \u2019 Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna Vaccine were tested on HEK 293 before they began human trials .\nThis testing is ongoing for all new batches .\nFinally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine grew a weakened viral strain in HEK 293 cell culture\u2026 \u201d \u201c The kidney in question was dissected from a healthy Dutch baby girl of unknown origin by the team at Leiden University in the Netherlands in 1972 .\nDespite the inclusion of the term \u2018 embryonic \u2019 in the title , the baby in question was probably 12-13 weeks old when she was killed so as to secure functioning kidney cells .\nThe man in charge of the research was named Alex Jan Van der Eb ; he is still alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When questioned on the matter by the FDA in 2001 , Dr Van der Eb confirmed it was an intentional abortion of a \u2018 fetus \u2019 but gave hazy details of the exact experiments.\n\u201d \u201c \u2019 So the kidney material , the fetal kidney material was as follows : the kidney of the fetus was , with an unknown family history , obtained in 1972 probably .\nThe precise date is not known anymore .\nThe fetus , as far as I can remember , was completely normal .\nNothing was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown to me .\nI probably knew it at that time , but it got lost , all this information \u2019 .\n\u201d Author Hacking continues : \u201c \u2026extracting and growing living cells is incredibly difficult .\nIn order to give oneself the best chance of success you need to ensure the child is healthy , fresh , intact and sterile .\nAs one embryologist and Emeritus Professor of Anatomy confirms : \u201d \u201c \u2019 In order to sustain 95 % of the cells , the live tissue would need to be preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within an hour the cells would continue to deteriorate , rendering the specimens useless \u2019 .\n\u201d [ That statement was made by \u201c Dr C Ward Kischer , embryologist and Emeritus Professor of Anatomy ; specialist in Human Embryology , University of Arizona College of Medicine\u2026 \u201d ] [ My comment : This suggests the abortion , in the Netherlands , in 1972 , was planned and technicians were standing by .\nI would say that , to ensure the viability of the tissue , the infant had a functioning blood supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , killing her . ]\nHacking : \u201c In order for the organs to be at \u2018 optimal viability \u2019 , the child needs to be dissected and organs extracted within 5 minutes of delivery .\nAnaesthetic also can not be used so as to not change the cellular activity of the organs the researcher wants to obtain.\n\u201d \u201c Acclaimed Doctor , Ian Donald , the pioneer of the ultrasound scanner , also claims to have witnessed the WI-38 [ another cell-line ] dissections [ 1962 ] , conducted at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c \u2019 Experiments were being performed on near-term alive aborted babies who were not even afforded the mercy of anesthetic as they writhed and cried in agony , and when their usefulness had expired , they were executed and discarded as garbage \u2019 .\n\u201d \u201c In his dense book \u2018 The Foetus As Transplant Donor the Scientific , Social , and Ethical Perspectives \u2019 , immunologist Dr Peter McCullagh relays detailed descriptions of the methods used on dozens of \u2018 fetal tissue donors \u2019 from the 1970 \u2019 s onward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 26 weeks gestation by decapitations , exposure , dissection and drug testing .\nGynaecologist and ex-abortionist Dr Bernard Nathanson , relaying his own understanding of abortion , and citing McCullagh \u2019 s book claims the Swedish experiments took place thus : \u201c \u2019 \u2026in Sweden they have been puncturing the sac of a pregnant woman at let us say 14 to 16 weeks , and then they put a clamp on the head of the baby , pull the head down into the neck of the womb , drill a hole into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then put a suction machine into the brain and suck out the brain cells\u2026..\nHealthy human fetuses from 7 to 21 weeks from legal abortions were used .\nThis is in Sweden .\nThe conception age was estimated from crown rump length and so on .\nFetal liver and kidney were rapidly removed and weighed .\nNow at 21 weeks , what they were doing , or 18 weeks , or 16 weeks , was what is called prostaglandin abortions .\nThey would inject a substance into the womb .\nThe woman would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby .\n50 % of the time , the baby would be born alive , but that didn \u2019 t stop them .\nThey would just simply open up the abdomen of the baby with no anesthesia , and take out the liver and kidneys , etc.\n\u2019 \u201d \u201c A research paper from the University of Toronto from June 1952 commenting on the method of their experiments suggests that these techniques were universal with researchers working in close proximity to the abortions.\n\u201d \u201c \u2019 No macerated [ softened after death ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embryos the heart was still beating at the time of receipt in the virus laboratory.\n\u201d \u201c According to Gonzalo Herranz , former head of the Committee of Medical Ethics of Spanish doctors , the best way to prevent \u2018 contamination by microorganisms \u2019 is to deliver the child by caesarean section or the removal of the uterus.\n\u201d \u201c A 1982 review of a history of tissue donation affirms this , and much of the above evidence : \u201d \u201c \u2019 Fetal tissue for transplantation must be \u201c harvested \u201d within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is by hysterectomy , with the fetus delivered in utero .\nDrugs which reduce fetal physiological activity need to be avoided .\nThe fetus is therefore in as alive and aware a state as possible when being opened \u2019 .\n\u201d From Hacking \u2019 s article , it \u2019 s quite clear how the standard procedure of infant-murder is carried out .\nIt \u2019 s entirely reasonable to assume fetal cell line HEK 293\u2014used for COVID vaccine testing\u2014was originally produced , in 1972 , by the murder of an infant .\nRefusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of conscience and religion is more than justified .\nGiven the weight of the circumstantial case , I would say that for all people of faith , refusal is essential .\nLunatic medical murderers and their allies will say anything to avoid blame and the application of true justice to themselves .\nThey will invent \u201c science \u201d at the drop of a hat and couch it in humanitarian terms .\nThey will claim the ends justify the means .\nThey will commit gross forgery to pretend those ends are vital .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand by and

and that \u201c it \u2019 s high time [ these companies ] increased their awareness.\n\u201d The prevalence [ of forced labor ] is indeed industry wide .\nThe risk of forced labour is endemic and systemic .\nWhen asked if it was a problem that some suppliers were shipping tomato goods from Xinjiang to Africa , Zenz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , it is -it means they are using a product that carries a high risk of forced labour , and then they say , \u201c we don \u2019 t sell this to the West , but it \u2019 s fine to sell it to Africans.\n\u201d Adrian Zenz did not misspeak .\nHe is very careful not to actually claim forced labor is taking place in Xinjiang in definitive terms , because to date , no such evidence exists to substantiate such a claim .\nRather , Zenz insinuates that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d of forced labor existing is not the same as actual forced labor taking place , yet this distinction is purposefully glossed over to deliberately insinuate that forced labor is most certainly \u201c taking place.\n\u201d SEE ALSO : US State Depart accusation of China \u2018 genocide \u2019 relied on data abuse and baseless claims by far-right ideologue Zenz not only does this during interviews but also in the actual reports the Western media and Western governments regularly cite as \u201c proof \u201d of abuses taking place in Xinjiang , China and against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general .\nAdrian Zenz in his December 2020 report ( PDF ) published by the DC-based Newlines Institute titled , \u201c Coercive Labor in Xinjiang : Labor Transfer and the Mobilization of Ethnic Minorities to Pick Cotton , \u201d would , after 20 pages of innuendo , conclude that ( emphasis added ) : Overall , it is clear that labor transfers for cotton picking involve a very high risk of forced labor .\nSome minorities may exhibit a degree of consent in relation to this process , and they may benefit financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transition between securitization and poverty alleviation is seamless , and where the threat of extralegal internment looms large , it is impossible to define where coercion ends and where local consent may begin .\nThere are strong indications that the labor transfer scheme is coercive in key aspects ( recruitment , transfer , on-site management ) .\nEvidence for this exists both for the broader scheme in general and specifically for labor transfer into cotton picking .\nTherefore , it is very likely that a major share of cotton production in Xinjiang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of the ability to conduct meaningful and independent audits of actual working conditions , it must be assumed that any cotton from Xinjiang may involve coercive labor , with the likelihood of coercion being very high .\nThis has drastic implications for supply chains not only within China , but also for countries such as India , Vietnam , Bangladesh , or Pakistan , to which Chinese cotton yarn and fabric is exported and made into clothing .\nThis was Adrian Zenz \u2019 conclusion \u2013 not a mere side note somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact replete with evidence that contradicts Zenz \u2019 premise that China is engaging in forced labor practices .\nAfter 20 pages of \u201c evidence \u201d Adrian Zenz admits that no actual audit has been conducted ( by him ) regarding actual working conditions workers from Xinjiang labor under .\nThis means that Adrian Zenz categorically can not conclude there is forced labor taking place in Xinjiang and can not actually even draw honest conclusions about how \u201c likely \u201d or what level of \u201c risk \u201d is associated with supposed forced labor.. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does Adrian Zenz define \u201c forced labor \u201d or \u201c coercive labor.\n\u201d Had he done so , the bar would have been raised even higher still and readers of his work would be left with the obvious conclusion that no evidence was available to write such a paper and ultimately , that such a paper should never have been written in the first place .\nIf the objective of the paper was purely political , the paper \u2019 s existence makes perfect sense .\nAnd indeed Zenz concludes his paper by offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and other governments around the globe to impose further economic sanctions on China .\nThe International Labor Organization ( ILO ) on its official website under a post titled , \u201c What is forced labour , modern slavery and human trafficking , \u201d clearly defines forced labor .\nAccording to the ILO , forced labor is : \u2026work that is performed involuntarily and under the menace of any penalty .\nIt refers to situations in which persons are coerced to work through the use of violence or intimidation , or by more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retention of identity papers or threats of denunciation to immigration authorities .\nMore specifically , the ILO defines it as : \u201c all work or service which is exacted from any person under the threat of a penalty and for which the person has not offered himself or herself voluntarily.\n\u201d The ILO identifies three elements as part of this definition : \u2022 Work or service refers to all types of work occurring in any activity , industry or sector including in the informal economy .\n\u2022 Menace of any penalty refers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compel someone to work .\n\u2022 Involuntariness : The terms \u201c offered voluntarily \u201d refer to the free and informed consent of a worker to take a job and his or her freedom to leave at any time .\nThis is not the case for example when an employer or recruiter makes false promises so that a worker take a job he or she would not otherwise have accepted .\nThere are exceptions recognized by the ILO as well , including : \u2022 Work in emergency situations ( such as war , calamity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood , famine , earthquake ) .\nThe use of force labor is specifically prohibited : \u2022 as punishment for the expression of political views , \u2022 for the purposes of economic development , \u2022 as a punishment for participation in strikes , \u2022 as a means of racial , religious or other discrimination .\nThese definitions were never fully qualified in Zenz \u2019 Newlines Institute report nor was any evidence presented to indicate working conditions in China met ILO criteria for forced or coerced labor .\nIn fact , Zenz himself offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing to fit ILO criteria .\nWhile he attempts to portray payments to laborers involved in cotton picking as falling short of promised wages he inadvertently offers up a logical explanation as to why some workers make less than promised .\nUnder a section of Zenz \u2019 report titled , \u201c Evidence Regarding Average Incomes for Cotton Picking \u201d ( page 18 of the PDF ) it states : State propaganda accounts often claim that cotton pickers can earn up to 10,000 RMB or more during their two to three months of hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income of 5,000 RMB or more .\nChina \u2019 s rural absolute poverty income line in 2019 stood at 4,000 RMB per person per year , meaning that a household of five would need to earn a total of 20,000 RMB or 1,667 RMB per month He then cites several accounts : One account of transferred cotton pickers claimed an average monthly income of 4,800 RMB .\nTwo other accounts , however , give average income figures of only 1,670 and 1,805 RMB per month .\nWhile it appears there is some discrepancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation \u2013 the more you work , the more you earn .\nYou may have been promised high wages \u2013 but under the assumption you did a certain amount of work \u2013 just like anywhere else in the world .\nThese averages also are skewed by the fact that especially skilled or able-bodied pickers can earn high amounts , while the majority of workers are left with comparatively mediocre remunerations .\nZenz then admits the lack of evidence he has to work with and again reiterates that this is not actual evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor that increases concern about coercion , \u201d ( emphasis added ) : While the available data points on this are limited and not representative , it is concerning that these averages are below the region \u2019 s minimum wage and below publicly stated wages for low-skilled factory work .\nGiven that cotton picking is difficult and typically requires relocation for months , this level of remuneration may not be attractive to some or many of those subjected to seasonal labor transfer \u2013 a factor that increases concerns about coercion .\nZenz also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do travel to villages to seek workers for seasonal work , it is voluntary .\nChinese cadres promote labor opportunities as well as positive work ethics , and will continuously return to communities to do so until locals are swayed and take advantage of government working schemes .\nVillage-based work teams and other government workers spare no effort in the mobilization process .\nIn a township that annually mobilizes 3,000 cotton pickers , 30 officials were reported to enter households to \u201c mobilize surplus laborers to go out.\n\u201d In a village in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locals were discovered to be \u201c unwilling to go out to work , \u201d officials entered every home for a second time and undertook \u201c thought education work \u201d until 60 persons had been mobilized into picking cotton .\nWere these schemes \u201c coercive , \u201d potential workers would simply have been coerced to work \u2013 instead it is clear even by Zenz \u2019 own account that the government was recruiting workers and would often leave with quotas unfulfilled requiring them to return later to ask again .\nZenz and others citing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparatus , erected after years of deadly terrorism , plays a role in pressuring Xinjiang minorities to join government labor schemes with claims that refusal to do so \u201c may \u201d land them in detention facilities .\nThe village-based work teams became a key component in the seamless integration of social control and securitization , linking household information with data from surveillance systems and the entire police state .\nZenz omits from his report the very real extremist and terrorist problem Xinjiang faced for many years and the necessity to not only create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also economic policies to drain the swamps of poverty that feed extremism and violence .\nZenz sidesteps this explanation and simply offers the coexistence of security and labor policies in Xinjiang as further evidence of the \u201c risk \u201d of coercive labor , insinuating that Uyghurs and other minorities who fail to join these labor programs are at risk of being detained .\nNo evidence of this is provided and Zenz \u2019 own report includes accounts of government cadres clearly not fulfilling quotas , leaving , and returning again to repeat the recruitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparatus used as a means of coercion , this would not have been necessary .\nQuotas would either be fulfilled on a cadre \u2019 s first visit , or detention centers would be filled \u2013 leaving no reason to return to a particular community for a second attempt .\nThere are many factors as to why Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang may not have wanted to initially join these labor schemes despite the obvious poverty even Zenz admits they faced .\nThis includes a fear of the unknown and concerns about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should they leave for several months to work elsewhere .\nThe Chinese government \u2013 again by Zenz \u2019 own admission \u2013 invested heavily in allaying these concerns .\nZenz \u2019 report notes : The mobilization of minority cotton pickers can involve other measures designed to \u201c free \u201d them to leave their homes for two months .\nThis includes centralized childcare and elderly care , as well as organizing the remaining villagers into small teams to look after the animals of those who pick cotton .\nAt one point he describes another aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed to allay fears Xinjiang \u2019 s ethnic minorities might have about travelling to work \u2013 having them accompanied by staff to assist them in all matters .\n\u2026a report from Aksu from 2020 states that cotton pickers are transferred to their work destinations in a \u201c point-to-point transfer \u201d fashion , which the article also refers to as \u201c nanny-style service.\n\u201d Cadres have different roles , with some acting as \u201c security staff \u201d : \u201c Give full play to the front-line [ cadres acting as ] \u2018 instructors , \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service staff.\n\u2019 Except under special circumstances , these must eat , live , study and work together [ with the cotton pickers ] , actively carry out ideological education during cotton picking , carry out epidemic prevention and control work , and assist in solving issues related to wage [ payments ] or accidental injuries.\n\u201d The account sternly warns cadres that they can not \u201c sleep in \u201d but must be with the workers at all times .\nThey are to operate like overseers .\nIn other words , these \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to the responsibilities described in Zenz \u2019 report , also serve as translators since many Uyghurs have a poor understanding of China \u2019 s national language , Mandarin .\nZenz \u2013 without any sort of qualification at all , simply labels them as \u201c overseers \u201d to fit the overall \u201c coercive labor \u201d theme of his report .\nIn reality , the presence of this support staff would allay fears for Xinjiang laborers working far from home and give them direct access to qualified people who could help them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to their day-to-day lives throughout the duration of their employment ( e.g .\nsolving issues related to wages or accidental injuries ) .\nThe fact that this support staff lived side-by-side seasonal laborers meant they had instant access to support rather than having to take a day off to visit \u201c human resources.\n\u201d What appears to be a highly thoughtful policy to enhance the working conditions of seasonal laborers is depicted by Zenz without qualification as slavery .\nRegimented Labor is Commonplace Across Asia , Not Indicative of \u201c Forced \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner Zenz describes Xinjiang laborers being subjected to is no different than large scale labor anywhere else in China , or even across the rest of Asia .\nZenz is depending on the cultural ignorance of his audience to portray the regimented nature of employment , including the use of uniforms , formations , training , and team-building exercises as some sort of punitive or coercive method .\nBeyond the superficiality of this argument , Zenz categorically fails to demonstrate how it is evidence of actual coercion , or even evidence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Risk \u201d of Forced Labor is not the same as Actual Forced Labor Zenz concluded his Newlines Institute report by noting the \u201c risk \u201d of coercive labor , not by noting actual coerced labor .\nWhile he uses the term \u201c high \u201d to quantify the risk , he never explains exactly what it means .\nWe can assume that if the risk was actually high and coercive labor was taking place on the scale Zenz and others have suggested \u2013 there would be actual evidence to finally lay this issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t .\nBecause of the United States government \u2019 s history of fabricating claims to justify otherwise indefensible economic sanctions and eventually military aggression against other nations , the lack of actual evidence presented by Zenz and others cited by the US government in regards to China means the only high risk that exists is the high risk we are being told another concerted lie .\nZenz admits he did not conduct any sort of actual audit of labor conditions in China , yet there are ways of doing so and companies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a US-based shoe manufacturer \u2013 in response to similar claims of coerced labor in regards to its supply chain did exactly that .\nIn a statement the company released earlier this year , it stated : Skechers USA , Inc. ( \u201c Skechers \u201d ) is aware of recent reports , including the Australian Strategic Policy Institute \u2019 s ( \u201c ASPI \u201d ) February 2020 Report entitled Uyghurs For Sale : \u2018 Re-education \u2019 , Forced Labour and Surveillance Beyond Xinjiang ( the \u201c Report \u201d ) , which allege that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home region to factories across China under conditions that suggest forced labor .\nImmediately upon learning about the allegations in the Report , Skechers reviewed its internal records and confirmed that Lu Zhou , like all factories and suppliers , has acknowledged the Skechers Supplier Code of Conduct .\nSkechers also confirmed that , consistent with regular practice , it conducted multiple audits on Lu Zhou in 2017 , 2018 , 2019 and 2020 , both announced and unannounced , and that none of these audits revealed indications of the use of forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The statement also referred to audits Skechers itself conducted which matched the above mentioned audits .\nIf Sketchers can do this , why can \u2019 t Adrian Zenz ?\nWhy can \u2019 t researchers in the West access these audits ?\nWhy aren \u2019 t these audits even mentioned in reports published by Zenz and others ?\nThere are two possibilities as to why Adrian Zenz , ASPI , and others making these accusations refuse to do actual audits and proper investigations of their own since conducting them is indeed possible .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then also unqualified to therefore investigate \u201c coerced labor \u201d in the first place .\nOr they deliberately choose not to , understanding that such audits would prove no coerced labor was taking place and remove this powerful propaganda tool from the table amid US-Chinese tensions .\nCBC \u2019 s recent report demonstrates the power this propaganda tool has \u2013 that without even proving coerced labor was taking place in Xinjiang \u2019 s tomato industry , businesses were targeted , pressured , and \u201c coerced \u201d to cut ties with Xinjiang companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s workforce as a result .\nBesides hurting China \u2019 s economy in a general sense \u2013 returning large segments of Xinjiang \u2019 s population back into poverty means opening the door back up to extremism and violence , and thus reintroducing a physical threat to China \u2019 s security as well .\nThe US has repeatedly demonstrated how far it will go to tell a lie \u2013 in regards to Iraq in 2003 , Libya in 2011 , Syria from 2011 onward , and now the US is telling lies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will deliberately tell lies \u2013 bolstered by the Western media and \u201c experts \u201d brought in specifically to buttress these lies \u2013 to implement war on the scale imposed on Iraq at the cost of a million lives including thousands of Western troops , why wouldn \u2019 t the US lie in regards to China ?\nConversely , considering the lack of actual evidence and Adrian Zenz himself using terms like \u201c the risk of \u201d coercive labor specifically because of a lack of evidence regarding actual coerced labor \u2013 what are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US and the Western media are telling the truth ?\nIf there is coercive labor taking place in Xinjiang or in regards to workers emanating from Xinjiang , no one has provided any evidence of it .\nIn fact , in an attempt to accuse China of coercive labor practices , reports like Zenz \u2019 regarding Xinjiang cotton seem to indicate the exact opposite \u2013 that China is recruiting workers and investing greatly in making these jobs as attractive as possible specifically because the work is voluntary .\nSee also : Deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Coerced Labor \u201d in Xinjiang China https : //youtu.be/z8uuzaG7dI4 *** This article was originally

treasure \u2019 for his artistry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a century .\nShe followed her suppression of his cartoons by removing him completely from the news pages .\nLeunig has been a lone dissenting voice amidst a torrent of government propaganda yet even he had to be silenced , One of his most striking suppressed cartoons is a play on the lone protestor facing the tank in Tiananmen square .\nLeunig turns the gun barrel into a syringe aimed at one of his typically bewildered characters .\n\u2018 Age \u2019 readers were incensed and supported the censorship but this legislation shows @ @

state security service ( STASI ) in former east Germany .\nHe said it allowed virtually unlimited interference in the civil liberties of the Victorian people , with little in the way even of consultation .\nA human rights council will be set up , but clearly for cosmetic purposes as it has no power to restrain Andrews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because nothing was known about the legislation outside the government until the day before this 121 page document was introduced in parliament .\nThe law is now effectjvely what Andrews says it is .\nThe barriers to stopping him are very thin .\nHe has a majority in parliament , and a weak opposition , Even the Greens and the Animal Welfare Party have supported this legislation , no doubt having struck some kind of deal with Andrews .\nThe federal government could possibly override the legislation on any number of grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will not intervene but that Victoria is perhaps being set up as a template for what is to come across the country and elsewhere to bring about the dystopian \u2018 great reset.\n\u2019 Thanks to Scott Morrison , the Prime Minister , Australia has been closed off to the world for close on two years .\nIts citizens have been unable to return and they have to apply for an exemption to leave .\nFew exemptions are being granted .\nTheir rights under international law have been completely violated .\nThe tens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries have no access to government services and state and federal governments and the media are indifferent to their plight .\nState borders remain closed .\nwith thousands of elderly Victorians who had travelled north to escape winter stranded in NSW for three months because Andrews closed the border in July before they could reach it .\nHow they survived in their caravans or hotels was their problem .\nAndrews didn \u2019 t care and neither did the media .\nMPs who have refused vaccination can not enter the Victorian parliament building @ @ @ @ @ @ @

dissenting opinion in which she described mandatory vaccination as a violation of medical ethics and international law .\nShe has been ordered to undergo \u2018 professional training \u2019 ,

but it has refused to take a public stand .\nThis is Australia 2021 , not Germany 1935/36 .\nThose who sneer at the comparison are deceiving themselves as the essentials are the same , Just like

FBI raids of writers or associates of Project Veritas , the conservative investigative journalism outfit .\nProject Veritas has been described variously as \u201c Gonzo \u201d or \u201c guerilla \u201d journalism and some insist it is more of a political than a press organization .\nHowever , it fits the definition of journalism , in my view , and that makes the raids troubling .\nAll the more troubling is the cause : the missing diary of President Biden \u2019 s daughter Ashley .\nThe New York Times reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York in search of the \u201c stolen \u201d diary that went missing days before the 2020 presidential election .\nProject founder James O \u2019 Keefe questioned how the Times received the story within an hour of the first raid .\nO \u2019 Keefe says that the organization actually received a tip that the diary was abandoned in a room , an allegation that harkened back to the abandoned laptop of Hunter Biden .\nHowever , Ashley reportedly insisted it was stolen .\nThe use of the FBI is also reminiscent of the still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden was Vice President to search for a gun discarded by Hunter Biden behind a restaurant .\nProject Veritas decided not to run the story because it could not verify that the diary belonged to Biden .\n( The FBI may have just offered that confirmation ) .\nInstead , it alerted the police , according to O \u2019 Keefe : \u201c Project Veritas gave the diary to law enforcement to ensure it could be returned to its rightful owner .\nWe never published it.\n\u201d So why the raids ?\nSince when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaries ?\nThe FBI can cite the interstate elements of the alleged theft as raising a federal crime .\nHowever , what is the crime ?\nIt is not clear if they are suggesting that the responsible parties were seeking to sell the diary or that there was some national security element ( which would be bizarre since Biden \u2019 s daughter was writing before her father ever became president ) .\nJournalist organizations are routinely given material removed from businesses , agencies , or private owners without permission by confidential sources .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to FBI raids , what happened to the new media policies of the Biden Administration after the Tucker Carlson controversy ?\nThere are a host of unanswered questions .\nHere are five to start with : \u2022 What was the context for the diary \u2019 s loss ?\n( Did Ashley Biden leave the diary in a room or was it stolen ? )\n\u2022 What is the alleged federal crime ( and what is the precedent for a major federal investigation over such an alleged theft ) ?\n\u2022 What precautions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the claimed media status of the targeted individuals ?\n\u2022 Why was there a delay in this action being taken if the alleged theft occurred a year ago ?\n\u2022 Has this matter been under investigation for a year and did the White House request the intervention of the FBI ?\nRegardless of how one feels about Project Veritas , there should be calls from media outlets for some answers to these basic questions .\nLikewise , Congress should be seeking such answers as part of its oversight responsibilities .\nA week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Project Veritas whistleblower provided a digital copy of Ashley Biden \u2019 s diary to National File .\n( \u2026 ) While the vast majority of the media ignored the bombshell revelations , perhaps dismissing their verifiability , The New York Times on Friday reported that the FBI had engaged in two raids on addresses as part of an investigation into how Ashley Biden \u2019 s diary was obtained .\nBut , true or not , does anyone not think if this was the alleged diary of Ivanka Trump it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media news organization \u2019 s website ?\nFirst Rep. Lauren Boebert chimed in on the alleged diary .\n\u201c So if the FBI raided someone \u2019 s house over Ashley Biden \u2019 s diary being stolen , that means Ashley Biden \u2019 s diary and the accusations in it were real .\nAre there any real journalists willing to ask Joe about it ?\n\u201d she said .\nAnd even as the entries from the purported diary of Ashley Biden have not been verified , what has been verified is that the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported .\n\u201c Late last year , we were approached by tipsters claiming they had a copy of Ashley Biden \u2019 s diary , \u201d Project Veritas founder James O \u2019 Keefe said .\n\u201c The tipsters indicated that they were negotiating with a different media outlet for the payment of monies for the diary.\n\u201d PLEASE HELP SUPPORT

U.S. Food and Drug Administration in late August 2021 , but only for adults , and only when carrying the Comirnaty label .\nNo other COVID shot has been FDA approved .\nHowever , Comirnaty is currently not available , and while the experimental , emergency use authorized ( EUA ) Pfizer shot is substituted for Comirnaty , the two products are clearly legally distinct and not the same \u2022 None A licensed vaccine is not shielded from liability until or unless it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the CDC .\nSo , if you were injured by Comirnaty , you could sue Pfizer .\nYou can not sue if injured by the EUA Pfizer shot ( or any of the other EUA COVID injections ) \u2022 None Even though several hundred claims have been filed with the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program ( CICP ) for injuries resulting from the COVID shots \u2014 which is the only possible avenue to obtain damages \u2014 not a single claim has been paid out \u2022 None Natural immunity is much stronger than what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which only provides antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and wanes within a few months .\nThe shots may in fact permanently limit the kind of immune response you would make were you to later be exposed or infected with COVID \u2022 None Children \u2019 s Health Defense has filed a lawsuit arguing you can not have a vaccine that is both an emergency use product and a licensed product at the same time .\nThat \u2019 s against the law , but the government has done it anyway .\nRemarkably , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , but the CHD has not given up and is still pursuing the case In this interview , Dr. Meryl Nass , an internist specializing in toxicology , vaccine-induced illnesses and Gulf War illness , shares her insights into the dangers of the COVID jab , which received an emergency use authorization October 26 , 2021 , for children as young as 5 .\nWe also discuss the conflicts of interest within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that seem to be behind this reckless decision , and how the agency pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval of Pfizer/BioNTech \u2019 s Comirnaty COVID injection .\nIs the COVID Jab Approved or Not ?\nThe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act removed liability for all vaccines recommended by the CDC for children .\nSince 2016 , they \u2019 ve also removed liability for vaccines given to pregnant women , a category that has become the latest \u201c gold rush \u201d for vaccines .\nNaturally , once a company is no longer liable for injuries , the profitability of the product in question increases dramatically .\nProducts under emergency use have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program ( CICP ) .\n\u201c It is a terrible program , \u201d Nass says .\nCICP is an offshoot of the 2005 PREP Act .\nSo far , even though several hundred CICP claims have been filed for injuries resulting from the COVID shots , not a single claim has been paid out .\nThis is important , because the statute of limitations is one year .\n\u201c It \u2019 s getting close to running out for people who were vaccinated early , \u201d Nass says .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lose the opportunity to get any compensation entirely .\n\u201c Of course , in fact , it \u2019 s really \u2018 an opportunity \u2019 to apply and get nothing because almost nobody gets paid , \u201d she says .\nAt that point , you have no further recourse .\nThere \u2019 s no appeals process to the judicial system .\nWhy Were the Shots Mandated ?\nAs you know by now , president Biden decided to mandate the COVID jab for most federal employees ( but not all ) and private companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We don \u2019 t know why that is , \u201d Nass says .\nIt doesn \u2019 t make sense , as large numbers of Americans have already recovered from COVID-19 and have durable , long-lasting immunity already .\nAs correctly noted by Nass , natural immunity is much stronger than what you can achieve from the injection , which only provides antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and wears off within a few months .\nThe shots \u201c may in fact permanently limit the kind of immune response you would make were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Nass says .\nFor these reasons , there \u2019 s absolutely no good reason to vaccinate people who have recovered from the infection and several bad reasons .\nThere \u2019 s evidence showing the shot can be more harmful for those with existing immunity .\nIn the documents released August 23 , 2021 , by the FDA , there were some interesting caveats .\nThey said the Comirnaty vaccine is essentially equivalent to the EUA vaccine and the two vaccines may be used interchangeably .\nHowever , they pointed out that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDA didn \u2019 t specify what these legal distinctions are .\n\u201c I concluded that the legal distinctions were the fact that under EUA , there was essentially no manufacturer liability , but once the vaccine got licensed , the manufacturer would be subject to liability claims unless and until the vaccine was placed on the childhood schedule or recommended in pregnancy , in which case it would then fall \u2026 under the NVICP , \u201d Nass says .\n\u201c Right now , Comirnaty is still not in that injury compensation program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it no longer falls under the CICP .\nSo , it is in fact subject to liability if you get injured with a bottle that says Comirnaty on it .\nOf course , if you \u2019 re Pfizer , what do you want to do ?\nYou don \u2019 t want to make that licensed product available until several months have gone by and Comirnaty has been put into the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program .\nSo , Pfizer and FDA have not made the licensed product available yet .\nWhat has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FDA has made a secret deal with the military and said , certain emergency use lots can be considered equivalent to the licensed vaccine , and [ told military medical staff ] which QR codes \u2014 which lots can be used .\n[ These specific lots ] can then be given to soldiers as if they \u2019 re licensed .\nSubsequently , we \u2019 re told that military clinics are actually putting Comirnaty labels onto bottles that are under EUA .\nNow , that probably can happen in the military , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to be memoranda of understanding within the military that we haven \u2019 t seen yet that say soldiers can not sue Pfizer for injuries \u2026 In the military , the government and Pfizer feel like they have set up a situation where nobody can sue , but in the civilian world , that has not happened , and so there is no Comirnaty available .\nYet , on the basis that FDA licensed this product , the federal government is still telling employers that they can mandate it and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vaccine , or they will lose government contracts .\nWe \u2019 re in a very interesting situation that is ripe for litigation , and Children \u2019 s Health Defense , which is an organization I represent , is litigating some of this .\nHowever , the litigation situation has been very difficult since the pandemic began .\nCases that normally would \u2019 ve been easy wins are being thrown out by the courts , both in the U.S. and in Europe .\nSomething strange has happened and the judges are looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t have to rule on the merits of these cases.\n\u201d The organization Children \u2019 s Health Defense has filed a lawsuit arguing you can not have a vaccine that is both an emergency use product and a licensed product at the same time .\nThat \u2019 s against the law , but the federal government did it anyway .\nRemarkably , the request for an injunction was initially thrown out , but Children \u2019 s Health Defense hasn \u2019 t given up and is still pursuing that case .\nCOVID Jab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US As mentioned , the FDA recently authorized the EUA COVID jab for children between the ages of 5 and 11 , which is simply appalling , considering they are at virtually no risk from COVID-19 .\nI \u2019 ve not seen a single recorded case in the entire world of anyone in that age group dying of COVID that didn \u2019 t have a serious preexisting comorbidity , such as cancer .\nIf you have a healthy child , they are at no risk from the infection , so there \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in this age group would be one-third the adult dose .\nTypically , when you \u2019 re giving a drug to a child , the dose is calculated based on the child \u2019 s weight .\nHere , they \u2019 re giving the same dose to a 5-year-old as an 11-year-old , despite there being a significant difference in weight .\nSo , it \u2019 s pure guesswork .\nWorse yet , the mRNA vaccines produce an unpredictable amount of spike protein , and even if they produce much too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the process once you have been injected .\nDespite clear safety signals , the FDA \u2019 s advisory committee authorized the Pfizer jab for 5- to 11-year-olds unanimously , 17-to-0 ( with one abstaining vote ) .\nHowever , when you look at the roster of the FDA \u2019 s committee members1 who reviewed and voted to authorize the Pfizer shot for children as young as 5 , the unanimous \u201c yes \u201d vote becomes less of a mystery .\nAs reported by National File2 and The Defender,3 the membership of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Products Advisory Committee ( VRBPAC ) has had staggering conflicts of interest .\nMembers have included : In addition to that , former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb is currently on Pfizer \u2019 s board of directors .\nAs noted by Nass , two of the members , one permanent and one temporary , are also CDC career employees whose job it is to push vaccines at the CDC .\nAs explained by Nass , in the clinical trial , there were two groups of children .\nThe first group was enrolled for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group was enrolled for just 17 days after receiving the second dose .\n( Pfizer added the second group because FDA claimed there weren \u2019 t enough volunteers in the first group . )\nThese two groups comprised over 3,000 children who got the jab and 1,500 or 2,000 who got a placebo .\nNone suffered serious side effects .\nThis was then translated into the claim that the injection was safe .\nHowever , as noted by Nass : Even though the advisory committee acknowledged that the blood test done for efficacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t reliable evidence of effectiveness , they still decided that all children , regardless of health status , would benefit from the injection .\nThey also ignored the fact that at least half the children are already immune , and giving them the injection will provide no additional benefit in terms of immunity , while putting them at increased risk for serious side effects .\nChildren Are Being Injected Without Parental Consent While all of that is bad enough , parents of young children now face the possibility of their children being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge .\nNass comments : All of this goes against the most basic concept of medical ethics , which is informed consent .\nNo one has the right to perform a medical procedure on you without your consent , or the consent of a legal guardian .\nThe government , again , without establishing any new laws , is simply bypassing the legal system .\nWill Young Children Be at Risk for Myocarditis ?\nBased on her review of the scientific literature , Nass suspects younger children in the now COVID jab-approved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at exponentially higher risk of myocarditis and other side effects compared to the 12- to 15-year group , where we \u2019 ve already seen a documented increase .\nNass goes on to recount an example from the smallpox vaccine , which also caused myocarditis .\nA military study that just looked at cases sent to specialists found roughly 1 in 15,000 developed myocarditis .\nA military immunologist then dug deeper , and drew blood on soldiers before and after vaccination , and found a myocarditis rate of 1 in 220 after receiving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 30 developed subclinical myocarditis where troponin rose from normal to more than two times the upper limits of normal .\nWhile asymptomatic , 1 in 30 had measurable inflammation of the heart .\n\u201c Right now , in terms of what the rate is for COVID , nobody is looking , no federal agency wants to find out the real rate , \u201d Nass says .\nYou Can \u2019 t Find Problems You Refuse to Look For A simple study that measures troponin levels \u2014 a marker for heart inflammation and damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could easily determine what the real rate of myocarditis is , yet that is not being done .\n\u201c This is what we \u2019 re dealing with , \u201d Nass says .\n\u201c All these databases , which is about a dozen different databases , that CDC and FDA said they could access to determine the rates of side effects after vaccination with COVID vaccines , they \u2019 re either not being used or being used improperly , \u201d Nass says .\n\u201c It was discovered that a new algorithm was being used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into use in January 2021 , immediately after the vaccines were authorized , and the algorithm was developed such that you compare two vaccines to each other .\nIf the pattern of side effects was similar between the two vaccines \u2014 which is often the case because there \u2019 s a limited number of general vaccine adverse reactions \u2014 even if one vaccine has a thousand times more side effects as the one it is being compared to , by using this flawed algorithm , if the pattern of reactions was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 times higher for one , the algorithm would fail to detect a problem .\nThat is the algorithm they \u2019 re using to analyze VAERS [ data ] .\nThey \u2019 re also using bad methods \u2026 to analyze the vaccine safety database , which encompasses 12 million Americans who enrolled in HMOs around the country .\nThe CDC pays for access to their electronic medical records and their data .\nSomehow when these databases have been looked at carefully , they \u2019 re finding very low rates of myocarditis in boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt was said months ago , \u2018 We can \u2019 t find a safety signal for myocarditis .\nWe \u2019 re not finding an anaphylaxis signal .\nwe \u2019 re not finding a Bell \u2019 s palsy signal.\n\u2019 The FDA \u2019 s and CDC \u2019 s algorithms couldn \u2019 t pick up for most known side effects .\nSo , there \u2019 s something wrong with the analytic methods that are being used , but the agencies haven \u2019 t told us precisely what they are .\nWhat we do know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are being reported to VAERS are phenomenal .\nThey \u2019 re orders of magnitude higher than for any previous vaccines used in the United States .\nAn order of magnitude is 10-fold , so rates of reported adverse reactions are 10 to 100 times higher than what has been reported for any other vaccine .\nReported deaths after COVID in the United States are 17,000+ .\nIt \u2019 s off the charts .\nOther side effects reported after COVID vaccinations total over 800,000 .\nAgain , more deaths and more side effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine combined in use in the U.S. cumulatively over 30 years.\n\u201d Despite all this shocking data , our federal agencies look the other way , pretending as if nothing is happening , and no matter how many people approach them \u2014 with lawsuits , with public comments , reaching out to politicians \u2014 they refuse to address blatantly obvious concerns .\nThis is clear evidence that they \u2019 re acting with intentional malice .\nThe FDA and CDC are supposed to protect the public .\nThey \u2019 re supposed to identify safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act as marketing firms for drug companies , but that \u2019 s precisely what they \u2019 ve been converted to .\nNew Formulations Have Never Been Tested Another truly egregious fact is that Pfizer has altered its formulation , allegedly to make it more stable , but this new formulation has never been included in any of the trials .\nNass explains : It \u2019 s nothing short of a dystopian nightmare .\nCompletely surreal .\nYou can \u2019 t make this stuff up .\nYet as shocking as all this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fauci projected that these COVID jabs would be available for everyone , from infants to the elderly .\nNow they \u2019 ve got the 5-year-olds , and there \u2019 s every reason to suspect they \u2019 ll go after newborns and infants next .\nWhose Babies Will Be Offered Up as Sacrificial Lambs ?\nAccording to Nass , Pfizer and the FDA have struck a deal that will allow Pfizer to test on babies even younger than 6 months old , even if there \u2019 s no intention to inject infants that young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the end of January 2022 .\nWhen will we get the data from those trials ?\nIt turns out that in the agreements reached between Pfizer and the FDA , some of those trials won \u2019 t conclude until 2024 , 2025 and 2027 .\nThe goal here is to vaccinate all Americans , children and adults , within the coming few months or a year , yet it \u2019 ll be five years before we actually know from clinical trials what the side effects may be .\nAs noted by Nass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may fulfill the letter of the law , but it doesn \u2019 t fulfill the meaning of the law .\nIt makes no sense to run clinical trials that won \u2019 t be completed until five years after your mass vaccination program has been completed and the entire population is injected .\nTo make matters even worse , it \u2019 s actually illegal to grant EUAs for these vaccines , because there are drugs that can prevent the condition ( COVID ) , as well as treat it .\nEUAs can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved , available alternatives to prevent or treat the infection .\nThe effective drugs most have already heard of are ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine , but there are a number of other drugs that also have profound effects on COVID , Nass says , including TriCor and cyproheptadine ( Periactin ) .\nTriCor , or fenofibrate , emulsifies lipid nanoparticles and fatty conglomerations that contain viruses and inflammatory substances .\nThe drug essentially allows your body to break down the viral and inflammatory debris better .\nAs such , it might also help combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID shot .\nAccording to Nass , Pepcid at high doses of up to 80 milligrams three times a day is also useful for treatment .\nDr. Robert Malone is starting a clinical trial using a combination of Pepcid and celecoxib ( brand name Celebrex ) .\nMany are also recommending aspirin to prevent platelet activation and clotting .\nI believe a far better alternative to aspirin is lumbrokinase , and/or serapeptase .\nBoth are fibrinolytic enzymes that address blood clotting .\nYou can develop sensitivity to them , so I recommend alternating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months if you \u2019 ve had COVID .\nYou could rule out blood clotting by doing a D-dimer test .\nIf your D-dimer is normal , you don \u2019 t need an anticlotting agent .\nIf clotting is a concern , you could also use NAC in addition to these fibrinolytic enzymes .\nIt too helps break up clots and prevent clot formation .\nTo learn more , be sure to peruse MerylNassMD.com and anthraxvaccine.blogspot.com .\nShe typically posts something every day to her blogspot blog .\nIn closing , Nass concludes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jabs are authorized [ under EUA ] , not licensed .\nThey \u2019 re all legally , technically , experimental .\nI know you can lose your job and all these terrible things can happen if you refuse the vaccine , but if you are injured by the shot , you won \u2019 t be able to sue later .\nYou will be on your own .\nLegally , they can \u2019 t force you to accept the vaccine while it is in EUA status because of the Nuremberg code , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because of the actual statute on emergency use authorization , which says you have the right to refuse .\nThey can \u2019 t force you to take these [ shots ] .\nI know they are forcing you , but legally they can \u2019 t , and please keep that in mind .\nHopefully these wrongs will be redressed .\nMandates are being walked back in many jurisdictions .\nAs I \u2019 ve told people , demand to see the bottle that says Comirnaty , because legally , they can force the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn \u2019 t any right now .\nSo , you have an out for the next few months , hopefully .\nThey \u2019 re really dangerous vaccines .\nWhat you don \u2019 t know will hurt you .\nPlease protect your children .\nIf there \u2019 s any way , don \u2019 t get vaccinated .\nThe more people who say no , the more the government is already backing down .\nIn many cities , the imposed dates by which you have to be vaccinated have been pushed back .\nNow Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it \u2019 s not going to be carved in stone .\nWe \u2019 re going to negotiate with people because they don \u2019 t want to lose 30 % or 40 % of their staff.\n\u2019 So , be strong , protect yourself and your children .\nKnow you \u2019 re doing the right thing .\nWe \u2019 ve got a criminal organization running things now .\nThis is a worldwide program of some kind designed to control us .\nOnce we all figure it out , we can win .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us than there are of them.\n\u201d WATCH THE THE VIDEO INTERVIEW

several problems , including selection of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend that the COVID shots are safer and more effective than they really are .\n\u2022 None According to all-cause mortality statistics , the number of Americans who died between January 2021 and August 2021 is 16 % higher than 2018 ( the pre-COVID year with the highest all-cause mortality ) and 18 % higher than the average death rate

natural immunity fell sharply over the summer , when the delta variant took over , the number of vaccinated people being hospitalized soared , from three per month on average during the spring to more than 100 a month in late summer .\nSince these vaccinated patients were less than six months from their second dose , they should have been at or near maximum immunity .\nCDC Hits New Lows With Two Manipulated Studies While recent data from the U.K. Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) reveal people who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all causes at a rate six times higher than the unvaccinated,1 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is propping up the official narrative with a \u201c study \u201d 2 that came to the remarkable conclusion that the COVID shot unbelievably reduces your risk of dying from all causes , which includes accidents ( but excluding COVID-19-related deaths ) .\nAs reported by CNN Health , October 22 , 2021:3 \u201c The research team was trying to demonstrate that the three authorized Covid-19 vaccines are safe and they say their findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pfizer-BioNTech , Moderna , or Janssen vaccines had lower non-COVID-19 mortality risk than did the unvaccinated comparison groups , \u2019 the researchers wrote in the weekly report4 of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nThe team studied 6.4 million people who had been vaccinated against Covid-19 and compared them to 4.6 million people who had received flu shots in recent years but who had not been vaccinated against coronavirus .\nThey filtered out anyone who had died from Covid-19 or after a recent positive coronavirus test \u2026 People who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34 % as likely to die of non-coronavirus causes in the following months as unvaccinated people , the study found .\nPeople who got two doses of Moderna vaccine were 31 % as likely to die as unvaccinated people , and those who got Johnson & Johnson \u2019 s Janssen vaccine were 54 % as likely to die \u2026 \u201d Two key takeaways from those paragraphs are 1 ) the researchers admit they intended to demonstrate that the shots are safe and effective , and stats can be manipulated to find what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who got the Janssen shot did in fact have a higher death rate than the unvaccinated ( 54 % likelihood , compared to the unvaxxed ) .\nThe researchers hypothesize that people who get the COVID jab may be healthier overall than those who abstain , and have healthier lifestyles .\nIn my view , this is classic Orwellian doublespeak , as most of the brainwashed don \u2019 t understand the fundamentals of healthy behavior .\nI suspect their new propaganda has more to do with the fact that they only looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBy mid-April , an estimated 31 % of American adults had received one or more shots.5 As of June 15 , 48.7 % were fully \u201c vaccinated.\n\u201d 6 So , we can assume that by the end of May , somewhere in the neighborhood of 45 % of eligible Americans were double jabbed , give or take a couple of percentage points .\nThe reason I suspect statistical tomfoolery is because this is precisely how the CDC invented the \u201c pandemic of the unvaccinated \u201d myth , where they claimed 99 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of COVID-related hospitalizations were occurring among the unvaccinated.7 To achieve those statistics , the CDC included hospitalization and mortality data from January through June 2021 , a timeframe during which the vaccinated were still in a minority .\nHere , we again see them use a seven-month span of time when vaccination rates were low .\nMore importantly , however , is that the chosen cutoff date also obscures a rapid rise in vaccine-related deaths reported to the U.S .\nVaccine Adverse Events Reporting System ( VAERS ) .\nLook at the graph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page.8 As you can see , reports of deaths following the COVID jab peaked right at the beginning of April 2021 , then dropped down again during the month of April .\nInterestingly enough , the study notes that the daily vaccination rate has declined by 78 % since April 13 , 2021 .\nHowever , while the daily vaccination rate has plummeted since April , reported deaths have remained high and relatively steady .\nCould this be a hint that people are dying from shots they received earlier in the year ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 0.5 % of the U.S. population had received a COVID shot , so comparing death rates of the vaxxed and unvaxxed in December 2020 and January 2021 may not be all that fruitful .\nWhy not include July , August and September in the analysis instead ?\nAs you can see , reported deaths were significantly elevated during these months , compared to December and January .\nAnd , while not shown in that graph , between September 3 , 2021 , and October 22 , 2021 , the total cumulative reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17,619.11 In other words , it more than doubled in about seven weeks \u2014 a timeframe that was not included in the CDC \u2019 s analysis .\nWhat \u2019 s more , while the study was large and socio demographically diverse , the authors admit that \u201c the findings might not be applicable to the general population.\n\u201d Also , recall they changed the definition of \u201c vaccinated \u201d to include someone who is two weeks past their second dose ( for two dose regimens ) .\nThis would obfuscate the truth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one jab or more but were not considered \u201c vaccinated.\n\u201d Why Is All-Cause Mortality Higher in 2021 ?\nAccording to all-cause mortality statistics,12 the number of Americans who died between January 2021 and August 2021 is 16 % higher than 2018 , the pre-COVID year with the highest all-cause mortality , and 18 % higher than the average death rate between 2015 and 2019 .\nAdjusted for population growth of about 0.6 % annually , the mortality rate in 2021 is 16 % above the average and 14 % above the 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did more people die in 2021 ( January through August ) despite the rollout of COVID shots in December 2020 ?\nDid COVID-19 raise the death toll despite mass vaccination , or are people dying at increased rates because of the COVID jabs ?\nIn a two-part series,13 Matthew Crawford of the Rounding the Earth Newsletter examined mortality statistics before and after the rollout of the COVID shots .\nIn Part 1,14 he revealed the shots killed an estimated 1,018 people per million doses administered ( note , this is doses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the first 30 days of the European vaccination campaign .\nAfter adjusting for deaths categorized as COVID-19 deaths , he came up with an estimate of 200 to 500 deaths per million doses administered .\nWith 4 billion doses having been administered around the world , that means 800,000 to 2 million so-called \u201c COVID-19 deaths \u201d may in fact be vaccine-induced deaths .\nAs explained by Crawford:15 Corroborating Crawford \u2019 s calculations are data from Norway , where 23 deaths were reported following the COVID jab at a time when only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That gives us a mortality rate of 575 deaths per million doses administered .\nWhat \u2019 s more , after conducting autopsies on 13 of those deaths , all 13 were determined to be linked to the COVID jab.16 Is the COVID Jab Responsible for Excess Deaths ?\nCrawford goes on to look at data from countries that have substantial vaccine uptake while simultaneously having very low rates of COVID-19 .\nThis way , you can get a better idea as to whether the COVID jabs might be responsible for the excess deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe identified 23 countries that fit these criteria , accounting for 1.88 billion individuals , roughly one-quarter of the global population .\nBefore the COVID jabs rolled out , these nations reported a total of 103.2 COVID-related deaths per million residents .\nFive nations had more than 200 COVID deaths per million while seven had fewer than 10 deaths per million .\nAs of August 1 , 2021 , 25.35 % of inhabitants in these 23 nations had received a COVID jab and 10.36 % were considered fully vaccinated .\nIn all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBased on these data , Crawford estimates the excess death rate per million vaccine doses is 411 , well within the window of the 200 to 500 range he calculated in Part 1 .\nAnother interesting data dive was performed by Steve Kirsch , executive director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund .\nIn the video \u201c Vaccine Secrets : COVID Crisis , \u201d 17 he argues that VAERS can be used to determine causality , and shows how the VAERS data indicate more than 300,000 Americans have likely been killed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 5 million have also been injured by them in some way .\nWhat Do the VAERS Data Tell Us ?\nIn a September 18 , 2021 , interview with The Covexit podcast , Jessica Rose , Ph.D. , who holds degrees in applied mathematics , immunology , computational biology , molecular biology and biochemistry , also discussed what the VAERS data tell us about the safety of the COVID shots .\nRose covers issues such as the magnitude of the side effects compared to other vaccination programs , the problem of under-reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the Bradford Hill Criteria .\nYou can find a PDF of the slide show that Rose presents here.19 Here \u2019 s a summary of some of the key points made in this interview : \u2022 Between 2011 and 2020 , the number of VAERS reports ranged between 25,408 and 49,412 for all vaccines .\nIn 2021 , with the rollout of the COVID shots , the number of VAERS reports shot up to 521,667 , as of September 3 , 2021 , for the COVID shots alone .\n( Fast-forward to October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tally for COVID-related adverse events has ballooned to 837,593 . )\n\u2022 Between 2011 and 2020 , the total number of deaths reported to VAERS ranged between 120 and 183 .\nIn 2021 , as of September 3 , the reported death toll had shot up to 7,662 .\nAs of October 22 , 2021 , the death toll was 17,619 .\n\u2022 Cardiovascular , neurological and immunological adverse events are all being reported at rates never even remotely seen before .\n\u2022 The estimated under-reporting factor ( URF ) is 31 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ from COVID shots is calculated to be 205,809 as of August 27 , 2021 ; Bell \u2019 s palsy 81,747 ; herpes zoster infection 149,017 ; paresthesia 305,660 ; breakthrough COVID 365,955 ; myalgia 528,457 ; life threatening events 230,113 ; permanent disabilities 212,691 ; birth defects 7,998 .\n\u2022 The Bradford Hill Criteria for causation are all satisfied .\nThis includes but is not limited to strength of effect size , reproducibility , specificity , temporality , dose-response relationship , plausibility , coherence and reversibility .\nIf you think the CDC \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-cause mortality is a low point in its irrational vaccine push , prepare to let your expectations sink even lower , with even more egregious Orwellian doublespeak implementation .\nOctober 29 , 2021 , the CDC released yet another study , this one claiming the COVID jab actually offers five times better protection against COVID-19 than natural immunity .\nAs reported by Alex Berenson in an October 30 , 2021 , Substack article:22 \u201c Yesterday the Centers for Disease Control , America \u2019 s not-at-all-politicized public health agency , released a new study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID infection better than natural immunity .\nOf course , a wave of stories about the benefits of mRNA vaccination followed .\nTo do this , the CDC used some magic statistical analysis to turn inside raw data that actually showed almost four times as many fully vaccinated people being hospitalized with Covid as those with natural immunity \u2014 and FIFTEEN TIMES as many over the summer .\nI kid you not .\nFurther , the study runs contrary to a much larger paper from Israeli researchers in August .\nAs my 2-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dat ?\nWell , the Israeli study drew on a meaningful dataset in a meaningful way to reach meaningful conclusions .\nIt counted infections ( and hospitalizations ) in a large group of previously infected people against an equally large and balanced group of vaccinated people , then made moderate adjustments for clearly defined risk factors .\nIt found that vaccinated people were 13 times as likely to be infected \u2014 and 7 times as likely to be hospitalized \u2014 as unvaccinated people with natural immunity .\nIn contrast \u2014 how do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study is meaningless gibberish that would never have been published if the agency did not face huge political pressure to get people vaccinated.\n\u201d Berenson goes on to dissect the study in question , starting with its design , which he calls \u201c bizarre.\n\u201d The CDC analysts looked at data from 200,000 Americans hospitalized with \u201c COVID-like \u201d illness between January and August 2021 in nine states .\nTwo groups were then compared : \u2022 Those who had confirmed COVID at least 90 days before and received another COVID test at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been fully vaccinated for at least 90 days , but not more than 180 days , before their admittance and received another COVID test at the time of their hospitalization Berenson points out what I stressed earlier , which is that choosing certain time or date ranges will allow you to make the shots appear a whole lot better than they actually are .\nHere , by choosing a 90- to 180-day inclusion range , they \u2019 re looking at a best-case scenario , as we now know the shots quit working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they \u2019 re only looking at that short window during which the COVID shots are at maximum effectiveness .\nThe 90-day criterion also ends up excluding the vast majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-like illness , both vaccinated and unvaccinated .\nWhile Berenson doesn \u2019 t address the vaccinated , few if any could have been fully vaccinated for at least 90 days prior to March , so why include January and February ?\nJust about everyone was by definition unvaccinated at that time .\nAs for those with natural immunity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between January and August had a previously documented COVID infection .\nAs noted by Berenson:23 \u201c Given the fact that at least 20 % of Americans , and probably more like 40 % , had had COVID by the spring of 2021 , this is a strikingly small percentage \u2014 and certainly doesn \u2019 t suggest long COVID is much of a threat.\n\u201d Of the 1,020 with natural immunity , only 89 tested positive for COVID , while 324 of the 6,328 vaccinated patients who met the study criteria tested positive .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 There were more vaccinated patients hospitalized for COVID-like illness than those with natural immunity ; this despite including months when vaccination rates were in the fractional and single digits , and \u2022 A greater number of vaccinated patients tested positive for breakthrough infection than patients with natural immunity \u201c And the CDC didn \u2019 t have , or didn \u2019 t publish , figures on how many people were actually in the two groups \u2026 Instead it compared the PERCENTAGE OF POSITIVE TESTS in the two groups .\nBut why would the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we don \u2019 t know how many people were actually at risk ?\n\u2026 [ A ] mazingly , the statistical manipulation then got even worse .\nThe natural immunity group had an 8.7 % positive test rate .\nThe fully vaccinated group had a 5.1 % positive test rate .\nSo the natural immunity group was about 1.7 times as likely to test positive .\n( 1.7x 5.1 = about 8.7 . )\nWith such a small number of people in the natural immunity group , that raw \u2018 rate ratio \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance .\n( We don \u2019 t know , because the CDC didn \u2019 t provide an unadjusted odds ratio with 95 % boundaries \u2014 something I have never seen before in any paper . )\nInstead , the CDC provided only a risk ratio that it had adjusted with a variety of factors , including \u2018 facility characteristics [ and ] sociodemographic characteristics.\n\u2019 And finally , the CDC \u2019 s researchers got a number that they could publish \u2014 hospitalized people who had previously been infected were five times as likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who were fully vaccinated .\nNever mind that there were actually four times as many people in the second group .\nScience !\nBy the way , buried at the bottom of report is some actual data .\nAnd it \u2019 s bad .\nThe CDC divided the hospitalizations into pre- and post-Delta \u2014 January through June and June through August .\nInterestingly , the number of hospitalized people with natural immunity actually fell sharply over the summer , as Delta took off .\nAbout 14 people per month were hospitalized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six per month from June through August .\n( Remember , this is a large sample , with hospitals in nine states . )\nBut the number of VACCINATED people being hospitalized soared \u2014 from about three a month during the spring to more than 100 a month during the Delta period .\nThese vaccinated people still were less than 180 days from their second dose , so they should have been at or near maximum immunity \u2014 suggesting that Delta , and not the time effect , played an important role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Perhaps Rep. Thomas Massie said it best when he tweeted:25 \u201c What do \u2018 road kill \u2019 and a CDC sponsored COVID paper have in common ?\nBy the third day , they \u2019 re so picked apart they \u2019 re unrecognizable .\nThis CDC Director is shameless for fabricating junk science with findings that stand in stark contrast to every credible academic study.\n\u201d Massie goes on to point out some obvious flaws and questions raised by the study , including the following : \u2022 The authors failed to verify recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any number of these \u201c reinfections \u201d may actually have been long-COVID .\n\u2022 The fact that more than 6,000 hospitalized for COVID symptoms were vaccinated , compared to just 1,000 with previous infection , counters the claim that 99 % of COVID hospitalizations are unvaccinated .\n\u2022 The number of vaccinated people hospitalized for COVID symptoms correlate negatively with the time since vaccination ; 3,625 were hospitalized within 90 to 119 days of vaccination , 2,101 within 120 to 149 days , and 902 within 150 to 179 days of vaccination .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine adverse effects or due to a temporarily weakened immune system from the vaccine ?\n\u201d Massey asks .\n\u2022 The study only considered those with natural immunity who ended up in the hospital , and not the ones who didn \u2019 t get sick .\n\u201c Natural immunity helps prevent hospitalization !\n\u201d Massey says .\nMassie also notes that this paper , which is only six pages long , has an astounding 50 authors , and at least half a dozen of them disclose Big Pharma conflicts of interest .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the CDC a cool $ 1 billion to promote the COVID jab , isn \u2019 t working for the CDC a conflict of interest as well ?\nMartin Kulldorff , Ph.D. , professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a biostatistician and epidemiologist in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women \u2019 s Hospital , also critiqued the study in a tweet , saying:28 \u201c This CDC study has a major statistical flaw , and the 5x conclusion is wrong , it implicitly assumes that hospitalized respiratory patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not .\nTrying to connect with authors.\n\u201d Natural Immunity Is the Best Answer Try as the CDC might to twist the data , there \u2019 s really no question that natural immunity is superior and longer lasting than vaccine-induced immunity .\nThis is also a long-held medical fact that has been tossed aside as too inconvenient to matter in COVID-19 .\nFor some undisclosed reason , the government wants everyone to get the COVID injection , whether medically warranted or not .\nThe sheer lunacy of that is cause enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the risky jab .\nI can tell you one thing , this policy has nothing to do with safeguarding public health , because it \u2019 s driving public health in the wrong direction .\nIt \u2019 s quite clear that the way out of this pandemic is through natural herd immunity , and at this point , we know there \u2019 s no reason to fear COVID-19 .\nOverall , its lethality is on par with the common flu.29,30,31,32,33 Provided you \u2019 re not in a nursing home or have multiple comorbidities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of COVID-19 is 99.74 % , on average.34 Additionally , we also know there are several early treatment protocols that are very effective , such as the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance I-MASK+35 protocol , the Zelenko protocol,36 and nebulized peroxide , detailed in Dr. David Brownstein \u2019 s case paper37 and Dr. Thomas Levy \u2019 s free e-book , \u201c Rapid Virus Recovery.\n\u201d Whichever treatment protocol you use , make sure you begin treatment as soon as possible , ideally at first onset of symptoms .\nThe reported rate of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , exceeds the reported death rate of more than 70 vaccines combined over the past 30 years , and if you are injured by a COVID shot and live in the U.S. , your only recourse is to apply for compensation from the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Act ( CICP ) .38 Compensation from CICP is very limited and hard to get .\nYou only qualify if your injury requires hospitalization and results in significant disability and/or death , and even if you meet the eligibility criteria , it requires you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it kicks in to pay the difference .\nThere \u2019 s no reimbursement for pain and suffering , only lost wages and unpaid medical bills .\nSalary compensation is of limited duration , and capped at $ 50,000 a year , and the CICP \u2019 s decision can not be appealed .\nFor a taste of what life is like for those injured by these shots , review some of the cases reported to nomoresilence.world .\nYou can also learn more

eliminated Measles globally .\nHowever , real data shows that incidences began plummeting long before there was any mass-vaccination program for measles .\nAccording the leading public health bodies

Colorado governor , this practice is not uncommon.2 Watch : In the early months of 2020 , many in the mainstream news media laughingly called concerns that there were more deaths reported from COVID-19 than could be attributed to the disease a \u201c death toll conspiracy.\n\u201d 3 Rolling Stone reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c anti-vaxxers \u201d who believe the numbers were inflated.4 Yet ,

who died \u201c with \u201d COVID-19 .\nPCR tests use something called \u201c cycle thresholds \u201d to look for positive cases .\nThe higher the threshold , the greater the risk a healthy person is labeled as a COVID-19 \u201c case.\n\u201d 5 In reality , PCR testing is not a proper diagnostic tool.6 Yet , it has supported the promoted narrative that the U.S. is suffering from a rising number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Clara and Alameda counties in California did an analysis of the number of people who died from COVID-19 .\nSanta Clara found a significant discrepancy.7 The data did not change .\nThe number of actual deaths did not change .\nBut the authorities found 22 % of the deaths recorded from COVID-19 could not be attributed to the virus .\nThe new numbers were generated by counting only those people whose cause of death was \u2018 from \u2019 the virus .\nThey left off the people who had tested positive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death was not the result of an infection from

the CDC \u201c may soon ask all counties to do the same as Alameda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation could also see a drop in its COVID-19 death toll.\n\u201d 9 In the Full Measure video above , Attkisson recounts the story from 2020 of the two deaths from gunshot wounds in Grand County , Colorado , that were recorded as COVID-19 deaths .\nThe video also reveals that what was happening in Grand County was

whether a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attkisson:10 Caruso believes that early in the process at the local level , death certificates are probably completed accurately .\nBut then , potentially at the state or federal level , there is a possibility that agencies are cross-referencing COVID tests against death certificates .\nAnyone who had tested positive is listed as a COVID-related death , regardless of how they died .\nWhen Attkisson checked the tally of deaths in Grand County in July 2021 , she found The New York Times had over reported the deaths , including the two gunshot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the county and two people who were recorded as dead but were alive.11 Merrit Linke is the chair of the Grand County Board of Commissioners .\nHe and the other commissioners drafted and signed a letter that was sent to the governor of Colorado .\nEssentially , the letter said , \u201c Hey , these numbers are not correct .\nIt \u2019 s not right .\nWe should report these correctly , and please fix this.\n\u201d 12 The response was appalling .\nBrenda Bock is the corner for Grand County , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commissioners .\nShe recounted her conversation with the governor of Colorado to Attkisson , saying , \u201c He told me he didn \u2019 t believe it was right , but he wasn \u2019 t going to have them remove it from the count because all the other states were doing it that way so we were going to also.\n\u201d 13 Financial Incentives Likely Contributed to Inflated Numbers The reason other states were over reporting COVID deaths , and maybe the reason the governor of Colorado wanted to continue , were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early as April 2020 , some health authorities were suspicious that the COVID-19 death counts were padded .\nHowever , Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) and the chief medical adviser to the president , brushed off those questions , even after the CDC numbers were called into question later in the year.14 A host of mainstream media also reported these suspicions were a conspiracy theory.15,16 Yet , in June 2020 , nurse Erin Olszewski gave first-hand testimony , sharing how financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mistreatment at a public hospital in Queens , New York.17 Olszewski was interviewed by The Press and the Public Project as part of the series \u201c Perspectives on the Pandemic.\n\u201d Olszewski has a long history of honorable service in the army .\nShe was deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 .\n\u201c Part of her duties involved overseeing aid disbursement and improvements to hospital facilities .\nWhile in the country she received the Army Commendation Medal for meritorious service and was wounded in combat.\n\u201d 18 She retired in 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued work as a medical freedom and informed consent advocate .\nAccording to Olszewski , patients who tested negative were routinely listed as positive and quickly placed on ventilators , a largely inappropriate treatment that ended up killing nearly all of them .\nBy August 2020,19 then-CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield admitted financial policies may have artificially inflated hospitalization rates and death toll statistics .\nIn response to a question before a House panel committee asked by Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer , R-Mo.\n, about potential \u201c perverse incentives \u201d that hospitals might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Washington Examiner21 also reported that in August 2020 more than 3,000 people were removed from the death count in Texas after it was revealed they did not test positive but were only considered a probable case .\nThe issue of inaccurately counting COVID-related deaths is continuing .\nBased on statements made by Dr. Rochelle Walensky , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , it appears the CDC is manipulating statistics to create a false and inaccurate impression .\nIn a July 16 , 2021 , White House Press briefing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people who are entering the hospital right now are unvaccinated.\n\u201d 22 Just a few weeks later , she inadvertently revealed how the CDC came by that statistic.23 The CDC took hospitalization and mortality data from January through June 2021 to come to this conclusion .\nHowever , during this time frame , most of the people in the U.S. were not vaccinated,24 so the majority of people in the hospital or who had died would not have received the vaccine .\nThe newest way that the CDC is playing with statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the first 14 days post-injection as unvaccinated.25 This not only artificially inflates the unvaccinated death toll , but also artificially deflates the number of people who die as a result of the genetic therapy shot .\nThe vast majority of deaths from the COVID jabs are happening within the first 2 weeks.26 These deaths are now being recorded as an unvaccinated death from COVID , rather than being counted as a death related to a breakthrough infection or vaccine injury .\nThis may be related to the fact that public health agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects from the shot and that they may have determined these were acceptable losses .\nAccording to Slide 16 in an October 22 , 2020 , presentation to the FDA by the director of Biostatistics and Epidemiology on some of the expected effects included:27 As you \u2019 ll note , many of these effects from the shot are reported in growing numbers to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) .28 Additionally , the FDA added a warning to the Pfizer and Moderna shots about the risk of heart inflammation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced the benefits of the shot outweigh the risk of a \u201c likely association \u201d between the shots and myocarditis in otherwise healthy young people.30 In June 2021 , CNN31 reported the CDC had received 1,226 preliminary reports of children with myocarditis or pericarditis through VAERS .\nInterestingly , the CDC found these numbers enough to issue a warning but have completely ignored the number who have died from the shots .\nBy October 22 , 2021 , VAERS had recorded 10,956 cases of \u201c rare \u201d 32 myocarditis and 17,619 deaths from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care professional for accurate information , it \u2019 s important to note that the American Medical Association is strongly advising doctors to follow the company line .\nAnd the company line is full of \u201c language swaps , \u201d samples of acceptable social media posts and information on how to deflect or redirect questions to push AMA acceptable content.34 Deception has been the name of the game since long before the vaccine was released .\nAs the push toward the \u201c Great Reset \u201d continues on multiple fronts , it is imperative that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same rhetoric and unsubstantiated messages to drive fear and impair American \u2019 s critical decision making .\nThe language swaps and sample social media posts take advantage of a powerful tool \u2013 words .\nLanguage is a powerful way to shape reality,35,36,37 because it shapes how we think about what we \u2019 re experiencing .\nAs noted by storyteller and filmmaker Jason Silva:38 For example , \u201c lockdown \u201d sounds like involuntary imprisonment imposed by a totalitarian regime , which is what it is , whereas \u201c stay-at-home order \u201d sounds far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home \u201d is typically associated with comfort and safety .\nThe AMA goes on to provide instructions on how to block , deflect and stall in the face of tough questions where an honest answer might break the official narrative .\nI encourage you to read through Page 8 of the guide and pay attention to how these psychological tricks are used when listening to interviews or reading the news .\nThe AMA \u2019 s guidance isn \u2019 t all bad .\nSome of its advice makes perfect sense .\nBut the inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements being made , and tools for steering , blocking , deflecting , redirecting and stalling to avoid direct answers do nothing but erode credibility and thus trust in the medical community .\nAfter having gathered data during the pandemic for roughly 19 months ( March 2020 to October 2021 ) it is imperative that the American people begin to question the number of reported \u201c cases \u201d and deaths in a country where medical care is reportedly better and more advanced than many other countries .\nIn other words , why does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deaths from an infection ?\n39 Might it be for the same reason that Australia is in a tyrannical lockdown when their infection rate is .6 % and just 1 % of those infected have died ?\nCould there be a different agenda than what you \u2019

pandemic laws and vaccination mandates .\nMainstream media outlets appear to be upset that attendees are daring to compare the decrees of their government to that of the Nazis , specifically citing state policies of targeted discrimination and medical apartheid .\nThe latest round of protests comes after the government \u2019 s push to enact new draconian legislation meant to \u2018 fight the pandemic.\n\u2019 Australian public health authorities are claiming that vaccinations are voluntary , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and above have been \u2018 fully inoculated \u2019 against the coronavirus .\nHowever , states and territories have had to deploy coercive and intimidating policies in order to enforce vaccine mandates , including threats by the state to prevent any employee from the right

at any time and for any reason .\nThe draconian legislation also gives the state new powers to levy crippling fines against any individuals or businesses who do not obey the state \u2019 s new

Columbia Journalism Review which exposed how Bill Gates has been busy injecting hundreds millions into media outlets around the world \u2013 and how in return he was not only given carte blanche access to many of those same media outlets to promote his own interests and projects , namely the global roll-out COVID-19 vaccine and select therapeutic drugs .\nNot surprisingly , Gates has also received unanimous fawning coverage of his constant promotion of lockdowns , masks and experimental mRNA jabs .\nAdditional information was revealed this week which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold over the mainstream media , based on over 30,000 individual grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2019 s own website database .\nThe beneficiaries include the biggest names in mainstream media , including CNN , BBC , NBC , NPR , PBS , The Guardian , France \u2019 s Le Monde , The Financial Times , The Daily Telegraph , Germany \u2019 s Der Spiegel , the Conversation , Education Week , the

million for The Guardian , and $ 10.8 million for Seattle-based Cascade Public Media , which owns local station KCTS-TV .\nWhile other billionaires \u2019 media empires are relatively well known , the extent to which Gates \u2019 s cash underwrites the modern media landscape is not .\nAfter sorting through over 30,000 individual grants , MintPress can reveal that the Bill and Melinda Gates

beliefs underpinning the technocratic elites \u2019 plan for planetary management has been the Malthusian myth that we are caught in an inescapable overpopulation death-spiral , one in which the Earth \u2019 s resources will soon be engulfed , rendering it uninhabitable .\nTheir proposed solution has always been the same : population management and reduction , facilitated through endless eugenics policies and mass-medical interventions enacted over the last century or so .\nWhile today \u2019 s globalist elites are much more reticent to openly admit their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predecessors , it is very likely that overpopulation doomsday beliefs are still driving the extremist end of both the climate change campaign and calls for a Green New Deal , as well as Klaus Schwab \u2019 s Great Reset agenda .\nStill , few in media or politics will openly challenge the overpopulation myth for fear of falling foul of crypto Malthusian zealots embedded in top positions in various high-powered NGOs and global institutions like the UN , World Health Organization , Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , Rockefeller Foundation , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precisely why when surveying the mainstream media coverage on the subject of global population , it is overwhelmingly dominated by heightened fears of over-population , and little or no coverage on the actual trend of under-population \u2013 despite the fact that even the UN is expecting global numbers to peak by 2100 .\nIn their book , Empty Planet : The Shock of Global Population Decline , authors Darrel Bricker and John Ibbitson explain why Malthusian predictions of over-population have been repeatedly over-exaggerated , and how many of today \u2019 s most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population decline .\nOne of those countries is India , currently sitting at approximately 1.3 billion people , but who is now experiencing a negative birthrate .\nThis trend appears to be irreversible , at least in the short to medium term over the next century .\nWhy ?\nBecause India \u2019 s total fertility rate is now heading well below what demographers refer to as the population \u2019 s \u2018 replacement level.\n\u2019 \u201c The country has been aiming for a TFR of 2.1 .\nA fall to 2 means we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means we will possibly still become the most populous country in the world \u2013 it was expected somewhere between 2024-2028 \u2013 but it will now be delayed .\nIt essentially means that we need not worry about a very large population being a challenge to our development , \u201d reported the Indian Express .\nThis is the first time Indian government has publicised a decline , according to data released by its own National Family Health Survey ( NFHS ) .\nNormally , the replacement fertility level is usually fixed at 2.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children per woman that is needed to keep a pace with the deaths in a country in order to maintain its current population levels .\nIn other words : the present generation is not producing enough children to replace itself , hence India \u2019 s population is now in decline .\nIncredibly , out of some 28 states and eight union territories surveyed , only five states recorded a fertility rate above two .\nSEE ALSO : Empty Planet : The World \u2019 s Shrinking Population As yet it is unknown exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s fertility rates , and this could be linked to a number of social , environmental , dietary , chemical , and pharmaceutical factors prevalent across the population .\nOne of the most signifiant may be the proliferation of pharmaceutical contraceptive products used in recent decades , the use of \u2018 modern methods \u2019 of contraception which rose from 54 % in 2016 , up to 67 % through the period of 2019-21 .\nAccording to the Indian Express report , the uptake of female sterilisation has increased to 38 % during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterilisation shows that the onus of family planning remains with women , with men not participating in the process and \u201c shrugging responsibility \u2019 \u2019 , according to Poonam Muttreja , executive director , Population Foundation of India .\n\u201c The Government must adopt a targeted social and behaviour-change communication strategy to ensure that men also take responsibility for family planning , \u201d Muttreja said .\nCurrently , India is the world \u2019 s second most populated country

Austin Fitts in Switzerland ahead of vote on November 28th , and warning of the danger posed by the present globalist coup .\nLong regarded as one of Europe \u2019 s original \u2018 bastions of democracy , \u2019 the country of Switzerland has become an important frontline against an elite-driven , global fascist movement that has since seized control over many leading western governments \u2013 in order to impose a brutal technocrat and medical apartheid regime .\nWill Switzerland retain its status as a shining beacon of freedom for the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pressures from its shadow government based in Davos ?\nIn less than two weeks , the world will have its answer .\nIt is in these clear and strong terms that the lawyer Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. addressed the Swiss during the demonstration of November 12 , 2021 , which took place in Bern .\nMoved by the importance of the issue at stake , the famous American lawyer , nephew of the former president of the United States , flew to the capital at the last minute to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution \u2019 in their effort to reject the Covid law , which had been approved by the federal parliament on the sly last September .\nDespite the fact that the Covid measures taken during the pandemic have been rather light compared to other European countries , which may have reassured many citizens , this new Covid law is a hidden attempt by the federal government and international organizations to establish a regime of exception .\nIt would allow them to impose their diktats until 2031 , a date that coincides with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economic Forum .\nIn Switzerland , the popular vote of November 28 , 2021 has already started .\nA majority of citizens are already voting by mail , while others will go to the polls on November 28 .\nThree objects are on the agenda : an initiative to strengthen nursing , an initiative on the appointment of judges by lottery and the \u2018 amendment of the March 19 , 2021 Covid-19 law \u2019 .\nThis text implies the approval of the Covid Certificate or \u2018 health pass \u2019 and the imposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of citizens and the competencies of the federated entities , bypassing the democratic process , but without stating it clearly .\nTo add insult to injury , the acceptance of the deprivation of freedoms is presented as being linked to possible financial compensation for damage caused by pandemic measures .\nHowever , it is the financial security and freedom of every Swiss citizen that is threatened by this Covid 19 law .\nThe brilliant American economist Catherine Austin Fitts , who accompanied Mr. Kennedy and our organization , Children \u2019 s Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : on the one hand , the pandemic is mainly a monetary event organized by central banks and private investment funds which allows the financial crisis to be attributed to a virus , while at the same time diverting taxpayers \u2019 money to private funds .\nOn the other hand and above all , it is a question of taking absolute control over the life of the citizens by putting into service a permanent control tool centralizing all the data .\nThe famous \u2018 health pass \u2019 is in fact intended to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will allow algorithms defined by a central authority to validate or prohibit in real-time any financial transaction according to a series of parameters linked to the health , the behavior or the opinions of each individual .\nThe proof being that in Italy this \u2018 QR code \u2019 certificate is directly issued by the Ministry of Finance and not by the Ministry of Health .\nIt seems therefore that the pact of silent coexistence and mutual benefit that allowed great freedom and democratic participation to citizens , in exchange for the grant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex .\nGAVI , WHO etc . )\n, is about to be broken .\nNot only would Switzerland not escape the control agenda deployed in the \u2018 Great Reset \u2019 , it would perhaps become its capital and one of its first victims .\nWhile it had recently withdrawn from the general cooperation agreement with Europe , Switzerland now seems to be falling into the hands of the United States and the international organizations it hosts .\nThus , in contradiction with its traditional role as a neutral country , the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Council , who has the open intention of promoting the 2030 agenda ( Davos ) .\nIt is in this same spirit that Guy Parmelin , President of the Confederation , was in Washington from November 19 to 21 , with a view to closer collaboration in the fields of business , education , research and innovation .\nHe was there to meet with Eric Lander , White House Science and Technology Policy Director responsible for pandemic response policies , including vaccine development for future pandemics ( after the coronavirus ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ received from Jeffrey Epstein , Lander , who chaired the Human Genome project for many years , is considered a central figure in the promotion of RNA technologies and \u2018 transhumanist \u2018 innovations .\nSince his nomination to the White House , he has taken the head of a new agency ARPA-Health ( or \u2018 Darpa health \u2019 ) whose objective will be to integrate surveillance data and individual biological data with the data collected by the GAFA in a synthesis opening the way to a form of digital dictatorship monitored by artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program ) .\nAt the same time , we are witnessing , for example in Switzerland the launch of the GESDA initiative , the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator whose objective is to form a global governance leadership through technology .\nThe fear that Switzerland will be catapulted into an Orwellian future is therefore very real .\nThis is also evidenced by a strong warning from Archbishop Vigano , former Vatican ambassador to the United States , on the occasion of the famous referendum .\nBut if many Americans are looking to Switzerland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their federal states are similar and because there , citizens \u2019 freedoms are sacred .\nIt is hoped that the appeals of international figures such as Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. and Catherine Austin Fitts , whose crowd-pleasing speeches have received hundreds of thousands of shares , and the remarkable work of Swiss whistleblowers and organizations , will succeed in altering the dark trajectory charted by the Davos elites .\nAs long as there is no fraud in the electoral process , a rejection of the Covid law is entirely possible .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the souls of those who live in the mountains , freedom is not an empty word .\nPutting an end to this dreadful agenda , a NO vote for the referendum on the 28th would send a strong signal to the world elite , and to its agents such as Fauci , Gates or Tedros , who might soon fall from their Pedestals .\nVIDEO : Watch RFK Jr and others explain why a \u2018 NO \u2019 vote is essential to preserving

ensemble to perform in Germany and Austria in 2022 .\nI \u2019 m fully aware of the twists and turns of the screw , the attempt of total control of society through the imposition of medical martial law .\nI \u2019 ve been following its global course with shock but not huge surprise since the start of 2020 .\nI am fortunate to have been researching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mercy of propagandist mainstream news .\nI know how and where to check the sources of what is then spun into so-called news for the purpose of manipulating the people into obedience through brain-numbing terror .\nThere was no \u2018 corona crisis \u2019 in reality .\nWhat happened was a long-planned manipulation of the usual flu season which each year always , unfortunately , kills many of our elderly and vulnerable .\nThis manipulation was achieved by simply attributing their deaths to a new \u2018 pandemic.\n\u2019 The so-called \u2018 tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were designed even before the virologists in Wuhan had computer-generated the assumed theoretical genome of the putative SARS-CoV-2 virus .\nThis assumed genome was created using what were deemed to be \u2018 likely \u2019 nucleotide sequences based on previous data entered in Genbank .\nThe WHO/UN attempted a similar con with the Swine Flu in 2009 .\nBut , due to the observations and expertise of Dr Wolfgang Wodarg , ( at that time a member of the German Bundestag and chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and vice-chairman of the Committee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe ) , the pandemic hoax was uncovered .\nDevastatingly however , by the time the lies were finally clear for all to see , many people had been permanently damaged by the new jabs , manifesting various symptoms including narcolepsy .\nImportant to note that once the scam was uncovered , the \u2018 Swine Flu \u2019 disappeared overnight from all of the mainstream media outlets .\nIn late Spring/early Summer 2020 mainstream news

understanding , since their brains were already turned off by the relentless gas-lighting and incoherent narratives they kept paying attention to from the mainstream media .\nIn 2009 , after the Swine Flu fiasco , the WHO quietly changed the definition of pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared even without any deaths .\nMainstream media has worked hand in hand with governments as the mouthpiece of propaganda in order to promote and maintain mass fear and hypnosis .\nThousands of world-renowned and expert voices from medical science have been silenced and smeared by the state-sponsored media in

to give the impression that there is a rampaging disease amongst the populations .\nI will certainly not be taking any of the new experimental medical injectables that are all still in trials until 2023 , that have only received approval on non-existent \u2018 emergency \u2019 grounds for a non-existent declared pandemic , and that have long since far surpassed the abilities of previous so-called traditional vaccines to maim and kill .\nI \u2019 m certainly not prepared to \u2018 show my papers.\n\u2019 I have a sovereign right to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no threat to anyone except those suffering from cognitive dissonance and mass hypnosis who yowl in pain when they are presented with facts that don \u2019 t correspond to their mass media-fuelled virtual reality , online existence

artists profess to generally not being interested in researching what is going on in the world yet persist in believing the mainstream news/political rhetoric without question , how can they claim to be \u2018 unpolitical \u2019 and , more to the point , what do they bring to their art ?\nIn past times , artists sat together discussing philosophy , politics , poetry and all manner of subjects and how these related to both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can communicate ideas .\nFor decades it has seemed to me that many artists are under the impression that they have some kind of priestly calling to not research or think critically about current or ongoing issues , and to churn out products or play gigs and tours as if it \u2019 s their entire raison d \u2019 \u00eatre .\nI have long felt that grappling with the truth of matters and researching all kinds of issues in this world is an essential aspect of developing as a human being and that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist \u2019 s voice .\nIt is not about being \u2018 political.\n\u2019 That the current political systems are a total distraction to polarise and confuse people is glaringly obvious , especially since 2020 .\nIdentity is first and foremost as a living being ; political allegiances are blinkers that prevent us from seeing clearly .\nIf the un-jabbed are not permitted to travel or perform in March 2022 , I would like you to consider the profound implications of replacing me in the ensemble and playing the concerts in the tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be enabling and supporting the current fascistic system that is driving towards a 2-tier society .\nYou mention that if I don \u2019 t take the jab/s and they are required by the venues and festival directors then you will be forced to search for someone to replace me in the group in order to play the dates .\nHave you so completely assimilated the propaganda and virtual reality ?\nHave you even asked the venue and festival directors about their position on this fascistic segregation promoting a 2-tier society ?\nOr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure the much sought-after invitations , hoping that the whole band will just follow the ludicrous , tyrannical rules like the Good Germans in the 1930 \u2019 s .\nLiving in a blinkered world , pretending and communicating to the audiences that none of this matters\u2026.transporting yourself and the audiences to the \u2018 other worlds \u2019 that live music offers , what a lie to live that way .\nPeople who don \u2019 t want to be part of this huge medical experiment have been losing jobs , losing livelihoods , losing touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see governments locking up the un-jabbed .\nIf you choose to be jabbed , then I assume you consider yourself to be protected against the covids ?\nSo why would I need to be jabbed ?\nTo protect you ?\nGood grief , the insanity and the lack of science is beyond what space and time affords me here .\nIt \u2019 s abundantly clear that massive division is the intention \u2013 division within families , relationships and society in general .\nGoing along with it all signals that you are absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look forward to all the ever-widening cracks in the narrative eventually bringing down the whole house of cards .\nI look forward to seeing those responsible for crimes against humanity such as have never been seen before receiving their just desserts .\nThose who have \u2018 just followed orders \u2019 and \u2018 rules \u2019 in order to keep their careers and societal standings have caused and continue to cause unimaginable and needless suffering all around the world will also receive their dues .\nOn discovering music improvisation I started to understand sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader and with nothing materially external to follow , this kind of music-making can have a profound impact on life , both on and off stage .\nFreedom and responsibility go hand in hand in this music-making \u2013 as in art , as in life .\nMaking music whilst listening to the sound of the river , the wind in the trees and the bird songs is far preferable to playing with musicians who essentially consider that accepting gig invitations which entail unnecessary and forced medical interventions for the ensemble ( and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerts ) to be ethically and morally acceptable .\nEven if I never set foot on a concert stage again because my artist colleagues are perfectly happy to comply with all the rules , to not think critically or stand up against this encroaching global totalitarianism and medical martial law , my skills as an artist will continue to inform my life and interactions with others .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

"Revealed: Vaccine Induced Cellular Ageing", "content": "In prior articles we discussed the increased risk of Sars Cov2 infection after Covid vaccination and introduced concepts of immune tolerance and immune training .\nIn this article I want to introduce the topic of cellular senescence , specifically as it relates to Covid vaccination .\nFrom Cellular Senescence : What , Why , and How we learn : Cellular senescence is a process that results from a variety of stresses and leads to a state of irreversible growth arrest .\nSenescent cells accumulate during aging and have been implicated in promoting a variety of age-related diseases .\nCellular senescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppression , wound healing , and protection against tissue fibrosis ; however , accumulating evidence that senescent cells may have harmful effects in vivo and may contribute to tissue remodeling , organismal aging , and many age-related diseases also exists Effectively , the process of senescence is synonymous with cell ageing , and for simplicity we can assume that inducing cellular senescence will promote accelerated ageing .\nWith caveats , there appears to be a plus side to that , potential tumour suppression .\nIndeed , pharmaceutical research , is interested in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as Gonzalez-Meljem et al .\npoint out in Paracrine roles of cellular senescence in promoting tumourigenesis , it \u2019 s a double-edged sword : Although senescence has historically been considered a protective mechanism against tumourigenesis , the activities of senescent cells are increasingly being associated with age-related diseases , including cancer .\nAn important feature of senescent cells is the secretion of a vast array of pro-inflammatory cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) .\nRecent research has shown that SASP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as enhancing malignant phenotypes and promoting tumour initiation .\nWhat of the mechanisms and why are they important for us to Know ?\nIn Management of multicellular senescence and oxidative stress Haines & colleagues explain : The first stage of cellular senescence is damage-induced cell cycle arrest , also called replicative senescence ( RS ) .\nTypically , this growth arrest is triggered by stress-induced DNA damage responses ( DDR ) , and also may be induced as a result of effects of telomere erosion \u2013 a phenomenon that produces stress-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly see that certain stressors can cause damage to DNA that induce responses in the cell that can lead to the cell cycle arrest .\nBecause DNA damage can lead to cancer , attempting to \u2018 switch it off \u2019 ( cycle arrest ) may be a good idea .\nOf course , when cellular senescence happens on a larger scale , as stressors accrue over time , it is recognised as ageing .\nBut what of vaccination ?\nIn SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Induces Paracrine Senescence and Leukocyte Adhesion in Endothelial Cells Meyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senescence and virus Sars Cov2 infected cells .\nTheir findings are concerning .\nVirus-infected or spike-transfected human epithelial cells exhibited an increase in senescence , with a release of senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) -related inflammatory molecules .\nThe key point is both Sars Cov2 virus infected cells and spike protein transfected cells induce cellular senescence .\nThat is troubling considering we are currently in a global campaign to vaccinate up to three or more doses to all ages , barring the very young , and all indications are they also will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given repeatedly each year .\nAll of which , per dose , produce in the order of billions or trillions of spike proteins .\nAnd remembering that animal studies demonstrated efficient distribution of the vaccine carriers ( of the mRNA to produce those spike proteins ) by varying amounts throughout the body , is a serious concern .\nBut let us continue with another paper released recently : Integrated Stochastic Model of DNA Damage Repair by Non-homologous End Joining and p53/p21- Mediated Early Senescence Signalling , where Yang & Mei demonstrated another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the spike protein inhibits both NHEJ and HR repair pathways , we analyzed the recruitment of BRCA1 and 53BP1 , which are the key checkpoint proteins for HR and NHEJ repair , respectively .\nWe found that the spike protein markedly inhibited both BRCA1 and 53BP1 foci formation ( Figure 3 D\u2013G ) .\nTogether , these data show that the SARS\u2013CoV\u20132 full\u2013length spike protein inhibits DNA damage repair by hindering DNA repair protein recruitment .\nThat was a bench study using cell models that demonstrated full length spike protein was expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is important to note that spike protein should not be found in the VIP compartment of the cell \u2013 the nucleus .\nOnce there , the spike protein prevented other proteins , for example BRCA1 , from being recruited for NHEJ repair \u2013 preventing repair of damaged DNA .\nNow , the body has back-up mechanisms but we know from oncology that damage to key proteins such as BRCA1 lead to significant increase in cancer risk and shortened life-span .\nThe literature demonstrates that DNA damage left unrepaired or not repaired properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ P ] ostmitotic cells rely on NHEJ for repairing DSBs .\nFailure to faithfully repair DSBs can result in point mutations , deletions and large genome rearrangements .\nWhere else could this be a serious problem ?\nMitosis .\nMitosis is cell division that is a vital part of repair , growth and embryo development .\nMitosis is a type of cellular division where the cell divides into two equal halves .\nThis type of division is very important in fetal development as this forms the basis of embryology .\nWith nanoparticles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the placenta ; and Covid19 vaccine lipid nanoparticles being in the order of 60-100nm , what of the risk to the developing foetus if it crosses the placenta and gains access to the developing foetus ?\nWhat we are witnessing here is burgeoning evidence of spike protein induced DNA damage and cellular senescence , with all their related sequelae and consequences : dysfunctional cellular repair , cancer and premature ageing \u2013 death .\nThe adage Sola dosis facit venenum or the dose makes the poison is a basic tenet in toxicology , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines .\nApart from all the other serious effects that have already been demonstrated as a result of vaccination heavily implicating spike protein ; repeatedly dosing human beings with Covid 19 vaccines , potentially inhibiting DNA repair and causing cellular senescence , with the attended risks of cancer and decreased life-span do not bear thinking about .\nIn the case of the developing foetus , would that risk entail never having a life to span ?\nAll the above is deeply concerning because the bench work is being done now revealing those serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic science done before the release of the vaccines ?\nAs we close this discussion on cellular senescence , analysis of the currently available all cause mortality reveals a death rate amongst the vaccinated twice that of the unvaccinated .\nI chose all cause rather than the Covid data due to the unreliability of Covid data .\nAll cause mortality is much cleaner and less corruptible .\nAs it is age standardised and expressed as per 100,000 it removes a lot of the normal confounders .\nThose data are very worrying coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pure statistical analysis .\nMechanisms are now being discovered that may help explain the paradoxical results of mass Covid 19 vaccination as partly evidenced by the all cause mortality data .\nOr more aptly Consectetuer est venenum \u2013 the dose is the poison .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

condition for totalitarianism .\nUnder mass formation , a population willingly sacrifices their freedom \u2022 None The central condition for mass formation to occur is a lack of societal bonding .\nIn other words , social isolation on a mass scale , which is precisely what the lockdowns were all about .\nBut even before the pandemic , social isolation was at a historical high \u2022 None The second condition is that a majority of people must experience life as meaningless and purposeless .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety and free-floating discontent .\nThis refers to discontent and anxiety that have no apparent or distinct causes \u2022 None The fourth condition is free-floating frustration and aggression , which tends to naturally follow the previous three .\nHere , again , the frustration and aggression have no discernible cause \u2022 None Once these four conditions are widespread , mass formation can occur , which allows for totalitarianism to rise and thrive .\nA key strategy to break mass formation and prevent totalitarianism is for dissenters to join together as one large group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet fully hypnotized an alternative to going along with the totalitarians .\nAnother is to loudly speak out against the totalitarian regime , as this is how atrocities are limited In this video , Mattias Desmet , professor of clinical psychology at Ghent University in Belgium , reviews the societal conditions under which a population ends up willingly sacrificing their freedom .\nDesmet , who also has a master \u2019 s degree in statistics , discovered peculiar anomalies in statistical analyses done during the COVID pandemic , which made him realize our global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass formation \u201d state , a type of \u201c collective hypnosis \u201d required for the rise of a totalitarian regime .\nIn this Aubrey Marcus podcast interview , Desmet reviews the step-by-step formula that results in this collective hypnosis , and how this formula has been deployed on the global population over the past two years .\nNeedless to say , he warns us about continuing down this path , and provides solutions that we can take , both on an individual and collective basis , to prevent the loss of freedom that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAround the end of February 2020 , Desmet started looking at case fatality rates and other statistics , quickly realizing that there was something seriously wrong with the models presented to the public and used as justification for shutting down \u201c nonessential \u201d businesses and telling everyone to stay at home .\nThe models were greatly exaggerating the threat of SARS-CoV-2 , and by the end of May 2020 , this was \u201c proven beyond doubt.\n\u201d For example , the Imperial College in London predicted that if Sweden did not lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the end of May 2020 .\nWell , Sweden opted not to lock down , and by the end of May only 6,000 people had died with a diagnosis of COVID-19 .\nStrangest of all , Desmet says , was that everyone kept saying the coronavirus countermeasures were based on mathematical models and science , yet \u201c when it was proven beyond doubt that the initial models were completely wrong , the measures continued , as if nothing was wrong and the models were right.\n\u201d Clearly , then , modeling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the equation at all .\nThis , Desmet says , \u201c was a strong sign that there was something going on at the psychological level that was really powerful.\n\u201d Another tipoff that something was really wrong was the fact that none of our political leaders were taking into account the collateral damage of their countermeasures .\nThere was no cost-benefit/risk-reward analysis for any of the countermeasures .\nThe World Health Organization did warn that the measures might result in excess deaths from starvation .\nYet at no time did we ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account both sides of the coin \u2014 the death toll from the virus , and the collateral damage of the countermeasures .\nAnd without such an analysis , we could not assess whether the countermeasures might be more harmful than the virus .\nAnytime you consider a public health measure , a cost-benefit analysis is essential .\nYou can not make a sensible decision without it .\nYet here , such basics were ignored as if the collateral damage was inconsequential .\nThe Four Base Conditions for \u2018 Mass Formation \u2019 What psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this apparent blindness ?\nAfter a couple of months , Desmet finally realized what was going on .\nSociety was ( and still is ) under the spell of a mass hypnosis , a psychological process known as \u201c mass formation \u201d that arises in society when specific conditions are met .\nThe central condition is a lack of societal bonding .\nIn other words , social isolation on a mass scale , which is precisely what the lockdowns were all about .\nWe were all told that any contact with others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a death sentence .\nI \u2019 ve heard of people who for over a year have not met with a single person , remaining locked in their homes the entire time , for fear of contagion .\nBut social isolation was a widespread problem even before the pandemic .\nMarcus cites a survey , which found 25 % of respondents didn \u2019 t have a single close friend .\nWhat \u2019 s more , the loneliest age group were young adults , not seniors , as typically suspected .\nSo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were suffering from a lack of community , which is a key condition for \u201c mass formation \u201d syndrome to emerge in the first place .\nThe second condition is that a majority of people must experience life as meaningless and purposeless .\nDesmet cites research showing that half of all adults feel their jobs are completely meaningless , providing no value to either themselves or others .\nIn another poll , done in 2012 , 63 % of respondents said they were \u201c sleepwalking \u201d through their workdays , putting no passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition No .\n2 for mass formation hypnosis was also fulfilled , even before the pandemic hit .\nThe third condition is widespread free-floating anxiety and free-floating discontent .\nFree-floating anxiety refers to anxiety that has no apparent or distinct cause .\nIf you \u2019 re in the jungle and find yourself chased by a lion , your fear and anxiety have a natural , easily-identified cause \u2014 the lion .\nHowever , when you are socially disconnected and feel your life has no meaning , then a free-floating anxiety can emerge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical representation of a specific threat .\nJudging by the popularity of antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs , condition No .\n3 was also fulfilled long before the pandemic .\nThe fourth condition is free-floating frustration and aggression , which tends to naturally follow the previous three .\nHere , again , the frustration and aggression have no discernible cause .\nWhen these four conditions are fulfilled by a large enough portion of society , they are ripe for mass formation hypnosis .\nAll that \u2019 s needed now is a story in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety is identified and spelled out , while simultaneously providing a strategy for addressing and neutralizing that cause .\nBy accepting and participating in whatever that strategy is , people with free-floating anxiety feel equipped , finally , with the means to control their anxiety and avoid panic .\nThey feel like they \u2019 re in charge again .\nInterestingly , when this happens , people also suddenly feel reconnected with others , because they \u2019 ve all identified the same nemesis .\nSo , they \u2019 re joined together in a heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety .\nThis new-found solidarity also gives their lives new meaning and purpose .\nTogether , this connection , while based on a false premise , acts to strengthen the psychological disconnect from reality .\nIt explains why so many have bought into a clearly illogical narrative , and why they are willing to participate in the prescribed strategy \u2014 \u201c even if it \u2019 s utterly absurd , \u201d Desmet says .\n\u201c The reason they buy into the narrative is because it leads to this new social bond , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nothing to do with it .\nThese losses can include their mental and physical health , their homes , livelihoods and material well-being .\nNone of it matters when you \u2019 re under the hypnotic spell of mass formation .\nAnd this , Desmet says , is one of the most problematic aspects of this psychological phenomenon .\nMasses of people become self-destructive through their myopic focus .\nGustave Le Bon , a French social psychologist renowned for his study of crowds once said : Le Bon \u2019 s book , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Popular Mind , \u201d 1 takes a deep-dive into the characteristics of human crowds and how , when gathered in groups , people tend to relinquish conscious deliberation in favor of unconscious crowd action .\nHe warned that if society didn \u2019 t take heed and ward of social isolation and the anti-religious idea that life has no purpose , we would end up in a state where mass formation would become the norm .\nThese psychologically damaged people would take over , which is precisely what happened .\nA key example is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while we typically think of dictatorships arising from the use of brute force and fear , the Nazi regime \u2014 and the leadership we \u2019 re faced with right now \u2014 came into power on the back of this deep psychological phenomenon known as mass formation .\nPeople WILLINGLY participated in the Nazi atrocities because of the psychological state society was in , the mass formation phenomenon , not because they feared their leader .\nSo , it \u2019 s important to realize that classical dictatorships and totalitarianism arise from different causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a classic dictatorship , the dictator becomes milder and less aggressive once dissident voices , his opposition , are silenced .\nOnce he has seized complete power , he doesn \u2019 t need to be aggressive anymore and can resort to other means to maintain control .\nIn a totalitarian state , the exact opposite occurs .\nThis is crucial for us to understand , because in a totalitarian society , once the opposition is silenced , that \u2019 s when the state commits its greatest and cruelest atrocities .\nAn example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1930s , which led to the death of about 80 million people in a single decade .\nThe mid-30s is also when the Nazi regime began its insane cleansing , which resulted in the Holocaust .\nBoth occurred after the vocal opposition had been quenched .\nWe \u2019 re now at another watershed moment in history , where the opposition to the pandemic madness is being silenced .\nIf we want humanity to survive and not succumb to global totalitarianism , we must keep speaking against it , because when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real atrocities will begin .\nIn other words , we ain \u2019 t seen nothing yet .\nThe worst is still to come \u2014 if we fall silent .\nHere \u2019 s another important point .\nTotalitarians don \u2019 t stop committing atrocities once the opposition is vanquished .\nIt merely expands to new groups .\nDesmet recounts how Stalin switched from one scapegoat to the next , as he kept running out of groups to blame and had them killed off .\nEventually , he ended up murdering half of his Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done nothing wrong and were loyal to him .\nThat \u2019 s something to ponder in our present situation .\nRight now , \u201c anti-vaxxers \u201d are the opposition the totalitarian regime seeks to destroy .\nOnce there are no more \u201c anti-vaxxers , \u201d say , theoretically , that everyone in the world got the shot , the opposition to be done away with would become some other group .\nSo , if you \u2019 re \u201c vaccinated \u201d and up on all your boosters right now and are cheering on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the shot , know that it \u2019 s only a matter of time before it \u2019 s your turn to be victimized over something .\nThe Tragic End That Awaits All Mass Formation Societies The fate of those who succumb to mass formation and embrace totalitarianism is particularly tragic , in a sense , because of another curious thing that occurs .\nPeople under its spell often end up agreeing that they deserve to die and willingly go to their death .\nThis , Desmet says , is what happened with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were given death sentences for no apparent reason .\nAs noted by Marcus , this is basically menticide , the killing of the mind .\nThe psychological process of menticide so degrades the mental faculties that rational thinking is no longer possible , making you profoundly gullible .\nIn this state , you \u2019 ll buy into any narrative without critical thinking .\nMass formation also always ends up creating more of the conditions that allowed it to emerge in the first place .\nSo , in the end , people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social isolation than ever before , less meaning and purpose in life , and more free-floating anxiety and free-floating aggression than before .\nMass formation also erases individuality .\nThe group becomes all-important and the individual inconsequential .\nHence being told you , your parents or children deserve or need to die for the betterment of society is acceptable and agreeable .\nApplied to today , this is shockingly relevant .\nIt helps explain how and why parents are willing to line up their children for an experimental injection that can disable or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster that ALWAYS devours its own children , \u201d Desmet says .\nAnother important point is that , typically , only 30 % of people in a totalitarian society are actually under the hypnotic spell of mass formation .\nIt seems greater , but they \u2019 re actually in a minority .\nHowever , there \u2019 s typically another 40 % that simply go along with the program , even though they \u2019 re unconvinced .\nThey don \u2019 t want to stick out by going against the prevailing current .\nThe remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wake the others up .\nThe so-called Ash experiments clearly demonstrated that very few people , only 25 % , are willing to go against the crowd , no matter how absurd and obviously wrong the crowd \u2019 s opinion is .\nTwo-thirds of people are willing to go along with \u201c idiocracy.\n\u201d Time and again , mass formation events and experiments show us there are three groups of people : those who become spellbound and actually believe that the wrong answer is the right one ; those who know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the truth so they agree with what they know to be false ; and those who know the answer is wrong and say so .\nAll of this points to what the answer is .\nAccording to Desmet , what dissidents need to do is join together to form one large group .\nThis gives the largest , 40 % group \u2014 the fence-sitters who only go along with the program because they \u2019 re afraid of being ostracized \u2014 an alternative social bonding platform .\nMost of them are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the totalitarian mindset that they don \u2019 t fully agree with .\nAt that point , the mass formation is done .\nThe totalitarian state is finished because the neutral fence-sitters , which allowed for mass formation to take root and grow , are now no longer participating in that process .\nAnd without mass formation , a totalitarian takeover can not succeed .\nSecondly , we must continue to speak out \u2014 LOUDLY .\nSpeaking out can help minimize the number of people who get hypnotized .\nIt can also wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass formation spell .\nAccording to Desmet , speaking out has also been shown to limit the atrocities committed .\nIt \u2019 s not easy .\nAs discussed by Marcus and Desmet , the totalitarian regime has the benefit of being able to control the narrative through a centralized media .\nNot surprisingly , mass media is a key tool for the successful creation of mass formation .\nA third action item is creating parallel structures .\nThe power of this strategy was demonstrated by Vaclav Havel , a political dissident who eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel structure is any kind of business , organization , technology , movement or creative pursuit that fits within a totalitarian society while being morally outside of it .\nOnce enough parallel structures are created , a parallel culture is born that functions as a sanctuary of sanity within the totalitarian world .\nHavel explains this strategy in his book , \u201c The Power of the Powerless.\n\u201d As noted by Desmet , totalitarianism will always self-destruct in the end .\nThe psychological underpinnings are so self-destructive that the system falls apart .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bad news is a totalitarian system can survive for long periods of time before petering out , and there tend to be few survivors at the end .\nThat said , Desmet believes this new global totalitarianism is more unstable than regional dictator-led totalitarian systems , so it may self-destruct faster .\nSo , the key is to survive outside the totalitarian system while we wait for it to self-destruct .\nHowever , we must still dissent in word and deed , in order to limit the atrocities and mitigate the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventing totalitarianism is far easier than trying to break free later .\nTo do that , we need to prevent the four root causes of mass formation in society : social isolation , purposelessness , free-floating discontent/anxiety and free-floating frustration/aggression .\nThis will be the task of those who remain once this global totalitarianism experiment fails and falls .\n1 The Crowd : A Study of the Population ( PDF ) PLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "author":

rolled out in front of our eyes .\nYet , for most people the implications are not visible .\nFor further details see the following articles by Peter Koenig : The Coronavirus Vaccine : The Real Danger is \u201c Agenda ID2020 \u201d .\nVaccination as a Platform for \u201c Digital Identity \u201d ( 28 June 2021 ) Agenda ID2020 of the \u201c One World Order \u201d : The 101 to Understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat is the Infamous Agenda ID2020 ?\n\u2022 Behind its development is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 with support of the Rockefeller Foundation \u2013 and others belonging to the sinister all-digitization , depopulation and eugenics agenda .\n\u2022 It is an alliance of public-private partners , including UN agencies and civil society .\n\u2022 It \u2019 s an electronic ID-program that uses generalized vaccination against Covid-19 as a platform for digital identity .\n\u2022 It is an all-electronic ID \u2013 linking everything to everything of each individual ( records of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private , etc . )\n, being managed by a state agency or in extremis , by the private sector .\n\u2013 Imagine \u2013 an insurance company or bank handling your private records , converted into an electronic and eventually \u201c chipped \u201d ID .\nPrivatization of your personal records may sound far-fetched , but the Swiss government tried to get a privatized Agenda ID2020 quietly past the people .\nBut the people found out and launched a referendum against Agenda ID2020 .\nThe idea was rejected with a margin of 2:1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next ?\n\u2013 Will the Swiss Government respect the vote of the people , or following the mandate from the Deep Dark State above ?\nGermany , Austria and France \u2013 and probably others , implemented ID2020 through Parliament or by decree \u2013 most people have no idea .\nImplementation of Agenda ID2020 links into \u2013 or emerged from \u2013 Klaus Schwab \u2019 s ( WEF ) infamous \u201c Covid-19 \u2013 The Great Reset \u201d - which , by the way , is available from Amazon ( or was , when I last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken off and censored , perhaps by the very author \u2013 it would be no surprise .\nClick here to link to bitchute version In the meantime , we live literally in a WWIII scenario , where countries \u2019 Constitutions are either outlawed , or simply overrun by dictatorial measures that advance so fast that civil movements are in many cases too late to intervene \u2013 simply because civil society \u2013 even the alert ones \u2013 haven \u2019 t noticed .\nEither by decree , or by coopted and / or coerced Parliaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being implemented basically everywhere in the world , with emphasis on the west .\nAnd most of the public at large has no idea .\nThe Gates and Rockefeller Foundations are financing WHO \u2019 s guidelines for a digital international Vaccination Certificate , also called \u201c Vaccination Passport \u201d .\nIn the context of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , the concept of Digital Documentation of COVID-19 Certificates ( DDCC ) is proposed as a mechanism by which a person \u2019 s COVID-19-related health data can be digitally documented via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate that documents a person \u2019 s current vaccination status to protect against COVID-19 can then be used for continuity of care or as proof of vaccination for purposes other than health care .\nThe resulting artefact of this approach is referred to as the Digital Documentation of COVID-19 Certificates : Vaccination Status ( DDCC : VS ) .\n( WHO , Executive Summary , emphasis added ) Surprisingly or perhaps not so surprisingly , the international \u201c Vaxx-certificate / passport \u201d is not funded by WHO \u2019 s member countries , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rockefeller .\nThat \u2019 s significant .\nWHO has published and distributed to all member countries on 27 August 2021 the guidelines for the introduction of an international digital \u201c Vaccination Certificate / Passport \u201d \u2013 as well as Implementation Guidelines .\nAs an apparent consequence , the Biden Administration issued an all-vaxx mandate \u2013 requesting all enterprises with 100 or more employees , to demand tat their employees be vaccinated , or else .\nFor non-compliance , huge fines are threatened .\nThe same for the two million-plus government employees .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ are affected by this draconian mandate .\nBiden follows the orders of Rockefeller et al .\nThis requirement will apply to over 80 million workers in private sector businesses , the White House said .\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) will require COVID-19 vaccinations for workers in most healthcare facilities \u2026 This requirement will impact over 17 million healthcare workers at hospitals and other facilities that take these patients .\n\u2026 The administration will require that teachers and staff in Head Start Programs , Department of Defense schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be vaccinated .\nBiden will also call on all states to adopt vaccine requirements for all school employees .\nBiden \u2019 s plan calls on entertainment venues like sports arenas , large concert halls , and others where large groups of people gather to require that patrons be vaccinated or show a negative coronavirus test in order to enter .\n( Reuters , emphasis added ) The Swiss and other EU countries also as a result of the WHO-issued vaxx-certificate / passport , mandate banning access to most indoor activities \u2013 including restaurants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 September , without a vaxx-certificate .\nThis is totally against the Nuremberg Code ( animal testing of drugs and vaccines before applying on humans ) and contradicts all democratic Constitutions .\nCountries \u2019 Constitutions worldwide are overrun and \u201c disabled \u201d by a tyranny that functions with enormous power \u2013 deadly threats and possibly highly seductive and corruptive rewards .\nNever in memory of human history has such a worldwide dictatorship existed .\nIt emerged in less than 12 months and has subjugated \u2013 I repeat myself \u2013 all 193 UN member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once .\nThe Vaccination Certificate / Passport may eventually be chipped into people \u2019 s bodies ( Klaus Schwab , WEF , in a 2016 interview with Swiss TV Geneva \u2013 recently \u201c erased \u201d from internet ) .\nSee this : Dr. Astrid Stueckelberger , former WHO : You are Being Chipped .\nThe Vaxx-certificate may form the basis for a worldwide digital identity registration .\nAs a parenthesis , both WHO vaxx-certificate financing foundations are headed by currently the world \u2019 s most visible eugenists \u2013 Gates and Rockefeller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the WHO member states are not directly involved .\nIt should also be mentioned that the creation of WHO in 1948 was Rockefeller \u2019 s idea , with all the money he had accumulated with his Standard Oil hydrocarbon ( mostly petrol and gas ) monopoly , the creation and subsequent integration of WHO into the UN system was relatively \u201c easy \u201d \u2013 with \u201c easy \u201d in quotes .\nMoney buys also the UN .\nWith WHO as part of the UN , an official UN institution is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 or diseases \u2013 exactly what eugenists want .\nThe World Bank is also an important player in this colossal criminal plan \u2013 because it hast the power over the poorer so-called \u201e developing countries \u201c \u2013 to pressure them with \u201aconditionalities \u2018 in return for financial support .\nThe usual .\nThe same as the IMF \u2013 their roles are essentially interchangeable .\nIn brief , we are indeed living in a WWIII scenario \u2013 without bombs and guns , directed against all Humanity An invisible \u2013 and never isolated \u2013 virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c Vaccine \u201d are their Weapons of Mass Destruction \u2013 WMD .\nWhat these measures do \u2013 \u201c Vaccination Certificate / Passport \u201d for the jabbed \u2013 is to separate society into the \u201c good ones \u201d , the \u201c vaccinated \u201d ones ; and the \u201c bad guys \u201d , those who are not vaccinated , do not intend to get the deadly jab , and thus , do not deserve the vaxx-certificate / passport .\nAccording to the lie-mongering governments \u2013 all 193 UN member countries whose governments have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like you to believe that the non-vaccinated are a danger for society .\nThis is nonsense , because according to the CDC , and repeated by the same UN member countries , jabbed people also transmit the virus .\n\u2013 What virus ?\nSeparating society is an age-old war strategy ( at least back to the Roman Empire ) : \u201c Divide et Impera \u201d \u2013 \u201c Divide and conquer \u201d \u2013 so that the people divide and fight each other , instead of their common enemy \u2013 which in this fake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 193 UN member governments \u2013 at once .\nAgenda ID2020 is the chief instrument for implementing the WEF \u2019 s Great Reset This is how : According to the Fifth Column \u2019 s Spanish Research Team , about 90 % or more of the \u201c vaxx-fluid \u201d in the mRNA-formula consists of Graphene .\n\u2013 Graphene is the secret of the Agenda ID2020 \u2013 which was patented by Gates with a ( luciferian ) patent No .\n666 .\nTriple-six , 666 , is also the chemical formula of graphene itself \u2014 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other such rings .\nThe symbol they \u2019 re using is 3 attached rings .\nGraphene inoculated by the mRNA-injection , forms immediately a neural net in the brain .\nIt is a one molecule thick net that spontaneously grows around the brain from the graphene contained in the vaxx

interview with the Swiss-French TV in 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since been \u201c fact-checked \u201d out .\nThis may explain the enormous time-pressure behind the vaxx-drive ; because once you are injected with the mRNA-concoction you are affected in one way or another .\nEither your health is endangered , or as outlined by Klaus Schwab ( see video below ) you may become a \u201c transhuman

managed to convince millions of Americans that Dr. Anthony Fauci is a hero .\nHe is anything but .\nHis criminality and career-long fraud has since been exposed in graphic detail by author Robert F Kennedy Jr in his new book , The Real Anthony Fauci .\nAs director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , Dr. Anthony Fauci has used $ 6.1 billion in annual taxpayer-provided funding for scientific research to promote , buy-off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist or doctor in America who is working on any research which might be consequential to Big Pharma \u2019 s

@ @ this level of outright corporate corruption and medical apartheid ?\nTop U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci is proposing to inject every eligible American with Wuhan coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) vaccine boosters every six months .\nHe shared this idea during a recent interview with the ABC program \u201c This Week.\n\u201d \u201c We would hope \u2013 and this is something we are looking at very carefully \u2013 that the third [ mRNA vaccine ] shot \u2026 not only will boost you way up , but increases the durability so that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months or a year , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We \u2019 re hoping it pushes out more .\nIf it doesn \u2019 t and the data show we do need it more often , then we \u2019 ll do it.\n\u201d Fauci expressed the same sentiment toward booster shots when he spoke to Business Insider .\n\u201c Make it really simple : If you had a primary vaccination , get a booster .\nRight now , don \u2019 t make it complicated , \u201d he said .\nThe National Institute of Allergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed hope that booster shots for all adult Americans will help keep people away from hospitalizations and deaths caused by COVID-19 .\n\u201c The effect of [ injecting boosters ] is very , very favorable to preventing people from getting infected , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We have got to get almost everybody who \u2019 s gotten the primary vaccination regimen \u2026 to get them all boosted .\nEven though for the most part , the vaccines absent the boost protect quite well \u2013 particularly among younger people \u2013 against hospitalization.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .\nThe public health agency only recommended booster doses for adults aged 50 and above and long-term care residents aged 18 and up .\nThe CDC said other Americans who do not fall under the two categories may get their booster shots \u201c based on their individual risks and benefits.\n\u201d Back in September , Fauci argued that two vaccine doses will no longer suffice for full vaccination .\nHe said during a White House briefing that month that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard for fully vaccinated individuals .\n\u201c I would not at all be surprised that the adequate , full regimen for vaccination will likely be three doses , \u201d Fauci said .\nHe continued that the

imposing harmony of opinion reigned from one end of Germany to another , undisrupted by discordant voices .\nOne wishes that this mechanically imposed harmony , admired as it may have been by some , had come to an end in 1945 .\nBut a YouTube bulletin ( see Google \u2019 s Covid Medical Misinformation policy ) disseminated a few days ago reminds us that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed of the prevailing \u201c Community Guidelines \u201d on a topic which currently is at the top of the list of public concerns : The Covid-19 crisis .\nHere are the highlights of that guidance : \u201c YouTube doesn

authorities \u2019 guidance on : Sceptics are encouraged to go directly to the source if they have doubts about the authenticity of these appalling prohibitions : see this .\nYouTube then goes on to specify : \u201c What this policy means for you if you \u2019 re posting content : \u201c Don \u2019 t post content on YouTube if it includes any of the following : \u201c Content that encourages the use of home remedies , prayer , or rituals in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor or going to the hospital.\n\u201d Notably , no definition of \u201c egregious harm \u201d or \u201c home remedies \u201d is given , nor is any rationale provided for prohibiting such remedies being recommended by persons who may have had a positive experience after using them .\nNor is it explained to millions of religious people throughout the world why prayer and procedures condescendingly termed \u201c rituals \u201d are also on the prohibited list .\nWill members of the Christian Science religious denomination , who since long before the appearance of Covid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes and avoided medical cures , now be required to alter their beliefs ?\nNot even in the Soviet Union were believers ever made to face such a stark choice .\nTo even the least sophisticated it should now be obvious that the thrust of YouTube \u2019 s guidelines is not to promote health but to steer patients toward the extremely expensive solutions that have enabled the pharmacological industry to make a financial killing from Covid-19 .\nThat impression is strongly reinforced by the nauseatingly repetitious proscriptions that follow : \u201c Content that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatment of COVID-19 \u201c Claims that Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for COVID-19 \u201c Categorical claims that Ivermectin is an

for the prevention of COVID-19 \u201c Claims that Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine are safe to use in the treatment COVID-19.\n\u201d What evidence is there that they are unsafe ?\nNo indications are

however , are now prohibited by YouTube from telling others about their successful recovery .\nIf YouTube were merely a media platform , what possible interest could it have in disparaging cheap and effective alternatives to outrageously expensive , untested , and harmful pharmaceutical preparations of undisclosed composition , for the ill effects of which companies that produce them refuse to accept any tort liability ?\nThe YouTube guideline goes on to disqualify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and \u201c claims that an approved COVID-19 vaccine will cause death , infertility , miscarriage , autism , or contraction of other infectious diseases , \u201d although it is an amply documented fact that it will do all those things .\nAlso forbidden are claims that \u201c an approved COVID-19 vaccine will

instance , 34-year-old Jeremy Chardy ( pictured above ) , a professional tennis player ranked 73rd in the world , suspended his season due to a severe adverse reaction to the COVID-19 shot , which left him unable to engage in intense activity .\nSpeaking with The COVID World , Chardy said:4 \u201c Since I had my vaccine ( between the Olympics and the US Open ) , I have a problem .\nI am

Triathlete \u2019 s Career May Be Over Due to COVID-19 Injections Veteran triathlete Antoine M\u00e9chin , 32 ( pictured above ) , is also facing the potential end to his career after receiving Moderna COVID-19 injections .\nAfter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience shortness of breath and low-back pain , which turned out to be a pulmonary embolism .\nThe symptoms , which included breathing problems and arm pain , started after the first dose , but doctors brushed off his shortness of breath as related to stress and fatigue .\nAbout a month after his second dose , shortness of breath and body pain returned .\nOnly after testing at a sports clinic was the pulmonary embolism revealed .\nM\u00e9chin said:5 Kyle Warner is another example of healthy people in peak physical condition being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 29-year-old professional mountain bike racer , got his second dose of Pfizer \u2019 s COVID-19 shot in June 2021 .\nHe suffered a reaction so severe that , as of October , he was still spending days in bed , easily overwhelmed by too much mental or physical exertion.6 Within seconds of the second dose , Warner experienced a metallic saline taste in his mouth , which can be an indication that the shot went into a vessel instead of the muscle.7 About two weeks later he started having strange reactions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started experiencing periods of accelerated heart rate .\nAs is often the case , an ER doctor completely brushed off his symptoms , telling him that he \u2019 s not having a reaction to the shot but instead was having an anxiety attack .\nDays after being sent home from the ER \u2014 and still experiencing heart problems , including cramping and burning \u2014 Warner went to a different hospital , where he was diagnosed with pericarditis along with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) and reactive arthritis .\nPOTS is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autonomic nervous system and can be triggered by injections , including mRNA COVID-19 shots.8 One of the key symptoms of POTS is a significant increase in heart rate when a person stands up , and the elevated heart rate remains elevated for a longer than normal period .\nFatigue , nausea , dizziness , heart palpitations and exercise intolerance can also occur .\nWhile his symptoms of pericarditis have cleared , he \u2019 s still struggling with the symptoms of reactive arthritis and POTS , which can last for 12 to 18 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fit and accustomed to listening to his body , caught the problem early \u2014 many others may not .\n\u201c I believe where there is risk , there needs to be choice , \u201d he said.9 But right now , people are being misled .\n\u201c People are being coerced into making a decision based on lack of information versus being convinced of a decision based on total information transparency.\n\u201d 10 Myocarditis and pericarditis cause symptoms such as chest pain , shortness of breath and a fluttering or pounding heart .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 injections ( Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna ) , particularly in male adolescents and young adults , according to the CDC .\nFurther , myocarditis occurs more often after the second injection , usually within a week.11 A large study from Israel12 revealed that the Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA jab is associated with a threefold increased risk of myocarditis,13 leading to the condition at a rate of one to five events per 100,000 persons.14 Other elevated risks were also identified following the COVID jab , including lymphadenopathy ( swollen lymph nodes ) , appendicitis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Israel included a mean of 884,828 people , aged 16 years and older , in each of two groups : one vaccinated and one control.16 The increased risk of myocarditis was clear , with researchers noting:17 When myocarditis occurs , it reduces your heart \u2019 s ability to pump and can cause rapid or abnormal heart rhythms that can be deadly .\nIn severe cases , myocarditis can cause permanent damage to the heart muscle and lead to heart failure , heart attack , stroke and sudden cardiac death.18 In August 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman following Pfizer \u2019 s COVID-19 jab , which they believe was due to vaccine-induced myocarditis.19 Another devastating report in VAERS states that a 15-year-old boy from Colorado , with no preexisting conditions or allergies , died from cardiac failure two days after receiving Pfizer \u2019 s COVID-19 vaccine.20 Unlike in the U.S. , where the CDC has recommended Pfizer \u2019 s COVID-19 shot for children 5 years and up , the U.K. is taking a more cautious and sensible approach .\nDue to myocarditis risks in youth , Britain \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JCVI ) recommended against COVID-9 injections for healthy 12- to 15-year-olds .\nWei Shen Lim , COVID-19 chair for JCVI , stated , \u201c The margin of benefit is considered too small to support universal Covid-19 vaccination for this age group at this time.\n\u201d 21 COVID-19 Injection Victims Need To Be

Prevention ( CDC ) officials and their bought media agents trotted out a new round of Gothic horror stories about a purported COVID \u201c variant.\n\u201d Their apparent hope is that the synchronized hullabaloo about \u201c variants \u201d will distract the public from the true nightmare that is unfolding : a record-setting uptick in all-cause mortality that jives suspiciously not only with the timing of the COVID vaccination rollout but with the top adverse events \u2014 heart failure , heart disease , circulatory conditions and strokes \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Media reports acknowledge the rising tide of \u201c extra non-COVID deaths \u201d and \u201c seriously ill people \u201d swarming emergency departments , even stating that patients are \u201c showing up much sicker than [ Er staff have ] ever seen \u201d and are younger than expected .\nHowever , while admitting patients \u2019 unusual symptoms \u2014 abdominal pain , blood clots , heart conditions and tingling of extremities \u2014 are not COVID-related , health officials assert \u201c no one knows why \u201d they are occurring .\nFor others , the explanation is obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would expect to see , \u201d said Mike Whitney of The Unz Review , \u201c if one had just injected millions of people with a clot-generating biologic that triggers a violent immune response that attacks the inner lining of the blood vessels inflicting severe damage to the body \u2019 s critical infrastructure.\n\u201d UCLA pediatric specialist J. Patrick Whelan , M.D.\n, Ph.D. , gave the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) ample warning about this very scenario back in December 2020 .\nAt the time , Whelan was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-lasting or even permanent damage to [ the ] brain or heart microvasculature \u201d from clotting and inflammation induced by the spike protein-based vaccines .\nBy July 2021 , Canadian physician Dr. Charles Hoffe was in complete agreement .\nHoffe \u2019 s experience with COVID-vaccinated patients indicated that not only is \u201c widespread microscopic blood clotting \u201d a virtually \u201c inevitable \u201d outcome of the mRNA vaccines , but \u201c the worst , \u201d in all likelihood , \u201c is yet to come.\n\u201d South African physician Dr. Shankara Chetty recently termed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most contrived poisons that man has ever made.\n\u201d Many experts are worried about the alarming heart and other atypical health problems that are surging worldwide in younger age groups , and notably in the UK and U.S. British physician Dr. Clare Craig told the press in late November , \u201c The excess deaths we \u2019 re seeing are circulatory deaths \u2014 they \u2019 re strokes and they \u2019 re heart attacks \u2014 and they \u2019 re much more in the young than in the older age groups.\n\u201d Craig has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is happening this year among 15- to 19-year-old males.\n\u201d A report in LifeSiteNews spelled out the situation more explicitly : \u201c It \u2019 s the young who are bearing the brunt of vaccine injury.\n\u201d Younger American teens began reporting \u201c terrifying \u201d heart problems and other injuries almost immediately after pharma-beholden FDA and CDC extended emergency use of Pfizer \u2019 s COVID vaccine to adolescents ages 12 to 15 this past May .\nUK reports have also noted the \u201c sudden jump in calls requesting an ambulance due to cardiac arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollout to younger adults and people under age 18 .\nAs of Nov. 12 , the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) had received more than 25,000 reports of injuries or deaths following COVID vaccination of 12- to 17-year-olds .\nAnalyses of VAERS data by Drs .\nJessica Rose and Peter McCullough indicate that within eight weeks of the vaccine rollout to 12- to 15-year-olds , younger teens were experiencing 19 times the number of myocarditis ( heart muscle inflammation ) cases that one would expect given the pre-COVID \u201c background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group .\nFurther analyses of VAERS data by Steve Kirsch ( founder of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund ) determined that COVID-vaccinated teenage boys ( ages 16\u201317 ) might be exhibiting myocarditis rates elevated by as much as 1,000 times .\nBut COVID vaccination is also disproportionately affecting young adults in their 20s and 30s .\nAmong 18- to 39-year-olds , 57 % to 61 % are reported to be fully vaccinated \u2014 significantly less than the 85 % to 89 % of fully vaccinated Americans age 65 and up .\nYet by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 213,000 reports of COVID-vaccine-related injuries or deaths for the hardier 18 to 39 age group ( more than 23 % of the more than 913,000 total reported adverse events ) , whereas the highly vaccinated 65-plus age group represented 18 % of the total ( around 169,000 ) .\nThe World Health Organization \u2019 s adverse event database shows that two-fifths ( 41 % ) of reported injuries have been in those 44 or younger .\nWhile Rose \u2019 s and McCullough \u2019 s conclusion that cardiac risks following COVID vaccination are \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines \u201d may well be accurate , cardiac complications from vaccination are not new .\nPackage inserts for various childhood vaccines list an array of potential heart problems that include chest pain , hypotension , myocarditis , palpitations , tachycardia and death .\nIn fact , sudden cardiac deaths in the young began climbing noticeably in the early to mid-2000s \u2014 around the same time the CDC was piling new vaccines onto the pediatric schedule .\nAlthough those changes , and other factors such as children \u2019 s vastly increased exposure to wireless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it challenging to ascertain what the \u201c background rate \u201d of childhood heart problems truly is , it is a safe bet that the incidence of cardiac issues in the young would be lower without toxic vaccine exposures .\nUntroubled by the scientific indecency of their May decision for adolescents , or by the explosive safety signals emerging from VAERS and other vaccine surveillance databases , FDA and CDC chose to expand Pfizer \u2019 s emergency authorization to 5- to 11-year-olds in early November , with the European Union rapidly following suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now attempting to normalize strokes and heart attacks in young children , teens and athletes .\nIn fact , rather than note that many of the healthy young athletes who have been collapsing \u2014 and , in some instances , dying \u2014 during 2021 sporting events had recently received experimental COVID shots , mainstream researchers are doubling down on the claim that \u201c getting vaccinated is probably the No .\n1 thing [ for young athletes ] to think about.\n\u201d Meanwhile , an estimated 10 % of 5- to 11-year-olds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID vaccine dose .\nAll too sadly and predictably , VAERS reports are flowing in for that age group \u2014 444 between Nov. 1 and 12 , and another 1,426 reports received pre-November , the result of \u201c product administered to patient of inappropriate age.\n\u201d As LifeSite News gloomily speculated in early November , \u201c it \u2019 s hard not to envision \u2026 rashes of VAERS reports , case studies and news accounts about little ones \u2014 five , six , and seven years old \u2014 suddenly having heart attacks on playgrounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thromboses.\n\u201d On the other hand , 90 % of children in the younger age group ominously targeted by public health officials remain unvaccinated for now , and news accounts suggest the numbers could remain low .\nThe Unz Review \u2019 s Whitney suggested , \u201c pandemic managers and their billionaire backers [ would ] love to see the impending mountain of carnage blamed on the waning virus instead of on their own poison-death shot.\n\u201d Fortunately , astute observers and children \u2019 s health champions are working to head off this worn-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its eye on the real dangers of injection instead of invented \u201c variants \u201d and \u201c

Global Research on May 27 , 2021 , and contains some crucial information which handedly refutes the pharmaceutical cartel \u2019 s deceptive claims that their experimental jabs are both \u2018 safe \u2019 and \u2018 effective.\n\u2019 As official government data is emerging in Europe and the USA on the alarming numbers of deaths and permanent paralysis as well as other severe side effects from the experimental mRNA vaccines , it is becoming clear that we are being asked to be human guinea pigs in an experiment that could alter the human gene structure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarming data including death of countless healthy young victims , the politics of the corona vaccine is being advanced by Washington and Brussels along with WHO and the Vaccine Cartel with all the compassion of a mafia \u201c offer you can \u2019 t refuse.\n\u201d On May 8 [ 2021 ] the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) an agency of the European Union ( EU ) in charge of the evaluation and supervision of medical products , using the data base EudraVigilance which collects reports of suspected side effects of medicines including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warranted mention in major mainstream media .\nThrough May 8 , 2021 they had recorded 10,570 deaths and 405,259 injuries following injections of four experimental COVID-19 shots : COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE of MODERNA ( CX-024414 ) ; COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE of PFIZER-BIONTECH ; COVID-19 VACCINE of ASTRAZENECA ( CHADOX1 NCOV-19 ) ; and Johnson & Johnson \u2019 s Janssen COVID-19 VACCINE ( AD26.COV2.S ) .\nA detailed analysis of each vaccine gives the following : The Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA gene-edited vaccine resulted in the largest fatalities\u2013 5,368 deaths and 170,528 injuries or nearly 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Moderna mRNA vaccine was second with 2,865 deaths and 22,985 injuries .\nThat is to say , the only two gene manipulated mRNA experimental vaccines , Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna , accounted for 8,233 deaths of the total registered deaths of 10,570 .\nThat \u2019 s 78 % of all deaths from the four vaccines currently in use in the EU .\nAnd among the serious side effects or injuries recorded by the EMA , for the two mRNA vaccines which we focus on in this article , for the Pfizer \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included blood and lymphatic system disorders including deaths ; cardiac disorders including deaths ; musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders ; respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders , and vascular disorders .\nFor the Moderna mRNA vaccine , most serious injuries or causes of death included blood and lymphatic system disorders ; cardiac disorders ; musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders ; disorders of the central nervous system.Note that these are only the most serious injuries related to those two genetically manipulated mRNA vaccines .\nThe EMA also notes that it is believed that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or serious side effects , perhaps only 1 % to 10 % , are reported for various reasons .\nOfficially more than 10,000 persons have died after receiving the coronavirus vaccines since January , 2021 in the EU .\nThat is a horrifying number of vaccine-related deaths , even if the true numbers are far greater .\nEven the US Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) a notoriously political and corrupt agency with for-profit ties to vaccine makers , in its official Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) , shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d including 4,057 deaths , 2,475 permanent disabilities , 25,603 emergency room visits , and 11,572 hospitalizations following COVID-19 injections between December 14 , 2020 and May 14 , 2021 .\nThat included the two mRNA vaccines , Pfizer and Moderna , and the far less prevalent J & J Janssen vaccine .\nOf the reported deaths , 38 % occurred in people who became ill within 48 hours of being vaccinated .\nThe official US vaccine-related death toll is greater in just 5 months than all the vaccine-related deaths from the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media worldwide and the US Government virtually bury the alarming facts .\nSome 96 % of the fatal results were from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines , the two variants funded and promoted by the Gates Foundation and Tony Fauci \u2019 s NIAID with the experimental mRNA genetic technology .\nMoreover , Dr. Tony Fauci , the US Biden Administration vaccine czar and his NIAID Vaccine Research Center co-designed the Moderna mRNA vaccine and gave Moderna and Pfizer each $ 6 billion to produce it .\nThat \u2019 s also a blatant conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are allowed to financially benefit from their patent earnings in the vaccine under a curious US law .\nThe NIAID developed the coronavirus spike proteins for the development of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines using taxpayer money .\nThey licensed it to Moderna and Pfizer .\nIn a tragic sense , the experience with reactions to the two unprecedented mRNA experimental vaccines since rollout in unprecedented speed \u201c warp speed \u201d as the US Government called it , is only now beginning to be seen , in real trials of human guinea pigs .\nFew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic manipulations that never before have been used in humans .\nAnd under the cover of urgency , US and EU health authorities waived normal animal trials and did not even approve the safety , but gave an \u201c emergency use authorization.\n\u201d Moreover , the vaccine makers were made 100 % exempt from damage litigation .\nThe general public was reassured of the vaccine safety when Pfizer and Moderna published reports of 94 % and 95 % \u201c efficacy \u201d of these vaccines .\nNIAID \u2019 s Fauci was quick to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Warp Speed was off and running as was the stock price of Pfizer and Moderna .\nPeter Doshi , Associate Editor of the British Medical Journal pointed to a huge flaw in the 90+ % reports for efficacy of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines .\nHe noted that the percentages are relative , in relation to the select small healthy young test group , and not absolute as in real life .\nIn real life we want to know how effective the vaccine is among the large general population .\nDoshi points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3400 \u201c suspected COVID-19 cases \u201d that were not included in the interim analysis .\nMoreover individuals \u201c in both Moderna and Pfizer trials were deemed to be SARS-CoV-1- ( the 2003 Asian SARS virus ) positive at baseline , despite prior infection being grounds for exclusion , \u201d Doshi notes .\nBoth companies refused to release their raw data .\nPfizer in-house scientists did their tests .\nIn short 95 % is what Pfizer or Moderna claim .\nWe are told , \u201c Trust us.\n\u201d A more realistic estimate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general public , using data supplied by the vaccine makers to the FDA , shows the Moderna vaccine at the time of interim analysis demonstrated an absolute risk reduction of 1.1 % , while the Pfizer vaccine absolute risk reduction was 0.7 % .\nThat is very poor .\nPeter Hotez , dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , says , \u201c Ideally , you want an antiviral vaccine to do two things .\n.\n.\nfirst , reduce the likelihood you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital , and two , prevent infection and therefore interrupt disease transmission.\n\u201d As Doshi notes , none of the trials were \u201c designed to detect a reduction in any serious outcome such as hospital admissions , use of intensive care , or deaths .\nNor are the vaccines being studied to determine whether they can interrupt transmission of the virus.\n\u201d Moderna \u2019 s chief medical officer even admitted that , \u201c Our trial will not demonstrate prevention of transmission.\n\u201d The authors point out that to keep the mRNA from breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both vaccine makers substitute methyl-pseudouridine to stabilize RNA against degradation , allowing it to survive long enough to produce adequate amounts of protein antigen .\nThe problem they point out is that , \u201c This form of mRNA delivered in the vaccine is never seen in nature , and therefore has the potential for unknown consequences\u2026 manipulation of the code of life could lead to completely unanticipated negative effects , potentially long term or even permanent.\n\u201d For various reasons to avoid using aluminum adjuvants to boost the antibody response , both mRNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as adjuvant .\nThis has consequences .\nThe authors point out , \u201c \u2026both mRNA vaccines currently deployed against COVID-19 utilize lipid-based nanoparticles as delivery vehicles .\nThe mRNA cargo is placed inside a shell composed of synthetic lipids and cholesterol , along with PEG to stabilize the mRNA molecule against degradation.\n\u201d PEG has been shown to produce anaphylactic shock or severe allergenic reactions .\nIn studies of prior non-mRNA vaccines , anaphylactic shock reactions occurred in 2 cases per million vaccinations .\nWith the mRNA vaccines initial monitoring revealed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 247 per million vaccinations .\nThis is more than 21 times as many as were initially reported by the CDC .\nThe second injection exposure is likely to cause even larger numbers of anaphylactic reactions.\n\u201d One study noted , \u201c PEG is a high-risk \u2018 hidden \u2019 allergen , usually unsuspected , and can cause frequent allergic reactions due to inadvertent re-exposure.\n\u201d Among such reactions are included life-threatening cardiovascular collapse .\nThis is far from all the undeclared risks of the experimental mRNA coronavirus vaccines .\nAntibody-Dependent Enhancement ( ADE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nigh note that , \u201c ADE is a special case of what can happen when low , non-neutralizing levels of\u2026 antibodies against a virus are present at the time of infection .\nThese antibodies might be present due to\u2026 prior vaccination against the virus\u2026 \u201d The authors suggest that in the case of both Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines , \u201c non-neutralizing antibodies form immune complexes with viral antigens to provoke excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines , and , in the extreme case , a cytokine storm causing widespread local tissue damage.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ are part of the body \u2019 s immune response to infection .\nBut their sudden release in large quantities , a cytokine storm , can cause multi-system organ failure and death .\nOur innate immune system undergoes an uncontrolled and excessive release of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules called cytokines .\nThe authors add that pre-existing \u201c antibodies , induced by prior vaccination , contribute to severe pulmonary damage by SARS-CoV in macaques\u2026 \u201d Another cited study shows that the much more diverse range of prior exposures to coronaviruses such as seasonal flu experienced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n\u201d This is a possible explanation for the high incidence of post-mRNA vaccination deaths among elderly .\nThe vaccine makers have a clever way of denial as to the toxicity of their mRNA vaccines .\nAs Seneff and Nigh state , \u201c it is not possible to distinguish an ADE manifestation of disease from a true , non-ADE viral infection.\n\u201d But they make the telling point , \u201c In this light it is important to recognize that , when diseases and deaths occur shortly after vaccination with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitively determined , even with a full investigation , that the vaccine reaction was not a proximal cause .\n\u201c The authors make numerous other alarming points including emergence of auto-immune diseases such as Celiac disease , a disease of the digestive system that damages the small intestine and interferes with the absorption of nutrients from food .\nAlso Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome ( GBS ) that causes progressive muscle weakness and paralysis .\nAdditionally , Immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) in which a person has unusually low levels of platelets \u2014 the cells that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccination \u201c through the migration of immune cells carrying a cargo of mRNA nanoparticles via the lymph system into the spleen\u2026 ITP appears initially as petechiae or purpura on the skin , and/or bleeding from mucosal surfaces .\nIt has a high risk of fatality through haemorrhaging and stroke.\n\u201d These examples are indicative of the fact that we are literally exposing the human race via untested experimental gene edited mRNA vaccines to incalculable dangers which in the end may exceed by far any potential risk of damage from something which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle substance proclaimed by WHO , Gates , Fauci and others , the Pfizer , Moderna and other possible mRNA vaccines clearly hold potentially tragic and even catastrophic unforeseen consequences .\nLittle wonder some critics believe it is a disguised vehicle for human eugenics .\n*** Author F.

madness has amplified , leading to the refusal of patients without a passport in hospitals ( which , as is well known , are intended to receive only healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients be vaccinated before receiving any treatment , including cancer patients .\nWe are in a world gone mad and yet these stories are multiplying , such as this young man of 22 years who had a chronic cough leading to an X-ray

there seems to be three situations : \u2022 The appearance of a cancer rapidly after the injection ( two weeks to a few months ) and very progressive , in a person who was previously free of known

coordinated restrictions on visitation rights .\nMost COVID-19 patients \u2019 families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is really being done to their loved ones .\nThe combination that enables this tragic and avoidable loss of hundreds of thousands of lives includes ( 1 ) The CARES Act , which provides hospitals with bonus incentive payments for all things related to COVID-19 ( testing , diagnosing , admitting to hospital , use of Remdesivir and ventilators , reporting COVID-19 deaths , and vaccinations ) and ( 2 ) waivers of customary and long-standing patient rights by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) .\nIn 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for waivers to CMS .\nAccording to Texas attorney Jerri Ward , \u201c CMS has granted \u2018 waivers \u2019 of federal law regarding patient rights .\nSpecifically , CMS purports to allow hospitals to or their surrogates with regard to medical record access , to have patient visitation , and to be free from seclusion.\n\u201d She notes that \u201c rights do not come from the hospital or CMS and can not be waived , as that is the antithesis of a \u2018 right.\n\u2019 The purported waivers are meant to isolate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deny patient and patient \u2019 s decision-maker the ability to exercise informed consent.\n\u201d Creating a \u201c National Pandemic Emergency \u201d provided justification for such sweeping actions that override individual physician medical decision-making and patients \u2019 rights .\nThe CARES Act provides incentives for hospitals to use treatments dictated solely by the federal government

.\nFailure to report information to CMS can cost the physician 4 % of reimbursement .\nBecause of obfuscation with medical coding and legal jargon , we can not be certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per COVID-19 patient .\nBut Attorney Thomas Renz and CMS whistleblowers have calculated a total payment of at least $ 100,000 per patient .\nWhat does this mean for your health and safety as a patient in the hospital ?\nThere are deaths from the government-directed COVID treatments .\nFor Remdesivir , studies show that 71\u201375 percent of patients suffer an adverse effect , and the drug often had to be

.\nYet , in 2020 , Anthony Fauci directed that remdesivir was to be the drug hospitals use to treat COVID-19 , even when the COVID clinical trials of remdesivir showed similar adverse effects .\nIn ventilated patients , the death toll is staggering .\nA National Library of Medicine January 2021 report of 69 studies involving more than 57,000 patients concluded that fatality rates were 45 percent

Global Priorities Institute estimate that there could be one quadrillion ( 1015 ) people to come \u2013 an estimate they describe as conservative .\nThese numbers , and the scale of suffering to be put into the balance alongside the good elements in individuals \u2019 lives , are difficult to fathom and so large that it \u2019 s not obvious that you should deflect the asteroid .\nIn fact , there seem to be some reasons to think you shouldn \u2019 t\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be so bad is that we have failed to recognise just how awful extreme agony is .\nNevertheless , we have enough evidence , and imaginative capacity , to say that it is not unreasonable to see the pain of an hour of torture as something that can never be counterbalanced by any amount of positive value .\nAnd if this view is correct , then it suggests that the best outcome would be the immediate extinction that follows from allowing an asteroid to hit our planet .\nCrisp equivocates a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not

increasingly clear .\nHis sheer wealth has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own right .\nHe \u2019 s not only risen to become the largest funder of the World Health Organization and the unelected global COVID-19 health czar but he \u2019 s also a secret powerbroker of the global food system .\nAs revealed in the AGRA Watch report,1 \u201c The Man Behind the Curtain : The Gates Foundation \u2019 s Influence on the UN Food Systems Summit , \u201d published August 2020 , Gates wields powerful influence over global food and agriculture policy through his funding of a large number of organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile Gates is just one man , his clout is significantly leveraged and magnified by the fact that he funds such a large number of companies and organizations that can then do his bidding on the sly .\nWhen you see long lists of groups , you automatically think there are many players in the game when , in fact , Gates is the singular thread running through most or all of them .\nThe AGRA Watch report2 makes a perfect case in point with the story of Agnes Kalibata .\nKalibata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Revolution in Africa ( AGRA ) , an organization funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .\nIn December 2019 , Kalibata was appointed special envoy to the 2021 United Nations Food Systems Summit by the secretary general of the UN , Antonio Guterres .\nIn response , 176 civil society organizations and farmer groups from 83 countries urged Guterres to withdraw the appointment of Kalibata due to her clear conflicts of interest with corporate actors .\nA second statement , signed by

Kalibata \u2019 s appointment .\nComing forward in her defense were a dozen individuals representing development banks , academic institutions and the private sector .\nThey urged Guterres to retain Kalabata , citing her leadership qualities and work ethic , among other things .\nHowever , of those 12 defenders , \u201c 11 had past or current connections to the Gates Foundation , \u201d AGRA Watch says , adding:3 In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had support from a dozen separate and independent individuals or groups , in reality , there are really only two voices speaking in her defense .\nIt \u2019 s just that Gates \u2019 voice is magnified times 11 .\nWhat \u2019 s more , his name is never actually mentioned , so to the uninitiated , it would appear he has nothing to do with it at all .\n\u201c These findings illustrate the influence of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ( BMGF ) on global food and agricultural policy .\nAGRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BMGF in influencing agricultural development , which has grown immensely in recent years , \u201d AGRA Watch writes .\n\u201c The Gates Foundation seeks to exercise influence not only through its funding of projects and shaping of expertise , but also in funding the governance platforms that determine food and agricultural policy .\nThis role of the BMGF in driving policy decisions based on its proprietary and technological model of agricultural development is often overlooked\u2026 .\nIn this report , we have demonstrated just some of the connections between the Gates Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s appointment as head of the UN Food Systems Summit .\nWhile hundreds of civil society organizations called for her removal , only twelve signatories were willing to support her appointment , almost all of whom were direct beneficiaries of the Gates Foundation .\nThis raises critical questions about the role of Bill Gates in shaping the agenda of the UN Food Systems Summit as well as its outcomes.\n\u201d The following graphic , included in the AGRA Watch report , illustrates the direct and indirect funding ties between the Gates Foundation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special envoy , Kalibata .\nAGRA Watch has raised concerns about the Gates Foundation \u2019 s influence on the agribusiness for many years .\nFor example , among its many research reports4 is the 2010 report \u201c The Revolving Door : Monsanto-Gates Links , \u201d 5 which details the direct links between the Gates Foundation and Monsanto representatives Rob Horsch , Florence Wambugu , Don Doering,6 the late Sam Dryden and Lawrence Kent .\nAnother 2010 report , \u201c Gates Foundation Links to Monsanto and GE Crops Development in Kenya , \u201d points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It to Solve Real-World Problems In its 2014 report,8 \u201c Three Examples of Problems with Gates Foundation Grants , \u201d AGRA Watch highlights why Gates \u2019 massive investments in global food production have failed to solve any of the very real problems we face .\nFirst and foremost , many of the solutions that he backs are \u201c Band-Aid solutions \u201d that in fact worsen the root problems .\nExamples include the funding of the development of genetically engineered ( GE ) foods designed to be higher in certain nutrients .\nThe problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacing local diversity with just a few GE varieties that don \u2019 t even take local conditions into account .\nSo , by pushing for \u201c fortified \u201d crop varieties , malnutrition actually deepens , as biodiversity is reduced .\nSecondly , \u201c a stubborn focus on yield \u201d is at odds with research showing that low yield or insufficient production is not causing world hunger .\n\u201c There is ample evidence today that the problem instead is poverty and lack of access , which is deepened by destruction of local food systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch notes , adding : A third problem highlighted in the report is Gates \u2019 funding of European and American research organizations and scientists rather than African ones , even though the programs are being implemented in Africa .\nAccording to AGRA Watch , \u201c This may not be a result of conscious intentions but of a deeply embedded structural bias that casts African scientists and scientific institutions as not qualified or legitimate enough to receive grant funding.\n\u201d Additional observations can be found in the AGRA Watch article9 \u201c Philanthrocapitalism : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not Charity , \u201d published December 2017 , in which philanthrocapitalism is described as \u201c an attempt to use market processes to do good , \u201d but which is inherently problematic \u201c as markets are ill-suited to producing socially constructive ends.\n\u201d Put another way , Gates \u2019 brand of philanthropy creates several new problems for each one it solves .\nAs noted in the article , advocates of philanthrocapitalism : One of the reasons many are now becoming aware of just how powerful Gates has become is because of his frequent appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s an odd choice , considering his complete and total lack of formal medical training .\nIt \u2019 s particularly perplexing in light of how the opinions of actual medical doctors , award-winning scientists and researchers who conflict with his views are being scrubbed off the internet .\nGates has repeatedly stated that life can not go back to normal until and unless we vaccinate the entire global population against COVID-19 .\nThis , despite the fact that scientists and medical researchers have discovered a variety of safe , simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe fact that Gates \u2019 irrational and scientifically unsound opinions are shaping pandemic responses around the globe while real medical professionals are being censored by mainstream media and social media platforms is proof positive that we \u2019 re no longer operating from a base of science and medical truth .\nInstead , the whole world is expected to fall into line with the self-serving agenda created by Gates and his many allies in technology and medicine .\nIn an April 30 , 2020 , GatesNotes post,11,12 Gates even states he \u201c suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become part of the routine newborn immunization schedule \u201d \u2014 a nice little piece of predictive programming , if you ask me .\nMind you , the mRNA vaccines being developed against COVID-19 will alter your genetic expression , turning your body into a viral protein factory .\nIs it really wise to consider using such a novel vaccine on newborns ?\nIn a sane and rational world , the answer would be a resounding no .\nUnfortunately , we now live in a world run by Gates \u2019 goons , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equation .\nIn predictable Hegelian dialectic problem-reaction-solution fashion , the problem of COVID-19 led to illogical and ill-conceived pandemic responses such as mask mandates and house arrest of healthy people , followed by the \u201c ultimate solution \u201d of a hastily thrown together vaccine using novel mRNA technology .\nRadical as all of that may seem , Gates \u2019 plans for the world do not stop here .\nHe \u2019 s also pushing for the implementation of a vast , global surveillance system to track and trace everyone \u2019 s infection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding the contact tracing group Partners in Health , along with George Soros .\n( The William J. Clinton Foundation has also funded Partners in Health in the past.13 ) Not surprisingly , Gates \u2019 recommendations end up benefiting himself most of all , with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation donating billions to the very same companies and industries that the Foundation owns stocks and bonds in .\nUsing nonprofit money to advance research for companies you \u2019 re invested in is illegal , yet he \u2019 s been getting away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , his Foundation gets tax breaks for the charitable donations it makes money from.14 Remember , he has \u201c donated \u201d tens of billions of dollars over the years , yet his net worth hasn \u2019 t dropped \u2014 it has doubled , and this is largely because his donations are treated as tax deductible investments .\nIt \u2019 s philanthrocapitalism at its finest .\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is undoubtedly Gates \u2019 biggest philanthrocapitalist project to date , and he stands to cash in big , as he \u2019 s funding/investing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In March 2020 , the Gates Foundation announced15 a new partnership , dubbed \u201c The COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator , \u201d with Wellcome and Mastercard to \u201c coordinate R & D efforts and remove barriers to drug development.\n\u201d According to the press release:16 The Gates Foundation has also teamed up with Serum Institute of India ( SII ) to manufacture 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and Novavax .\nThe vaccines , which will cost less than $ 3 per dose , are slated for delivery to low-income countries.17,18 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgivable loan to Gavi , the Vaccine Alliance , founded by the Gates Foundation in 2000 , which will then provide the needed capital to SII .\nOver the next five years , the Foundation has also pledged to provide Gavi with a total of $ 1.6 billion in additional funds.19 Having an overarching influence over technology , food and medicine ( vaccines in particular ) still doesn \u2019 t adequately describe Gates \u2019 influence on our daily lives .\nHe \u2019 s also had a profound influence over education .\nThe much-criticized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s attempt at remaking American education,20 and most parents can tell you how dumb that was.21 Despite that abysmal failure , May 6 , 2020 , New York Gov .\nAndrew Cuomo announced the state is partnering with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop \u201c a smarter education system \u201d for the post-COVID world that will focus on online learning and permanently integrate technology into every aspect of civic life.22 The state is also partnering with Google , and Cuomo has asked former Google CEO Eric Schmidt to head a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s technological infrastructure.23 As noted by The Intercept,24 the surveillance apparatus that consumers have been railing against is now being rebranded as the answer to everyone \u2019 s health concerns .\nGates Is the Most Visible Figurehead of Modern Technocracy Whether preplanned or not , the COVID-19 pandemic is clearly being used to usher in highly controversial changes that are unmistakably totalitarian-building , including the private take-over of government through public-private partnerships .\nSurveillance has become the biggest for-profit industry on the planet , and your entire existence is now being targeted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit the most is

Mainstream Media Cover-up Decades of Child Vaccine Injuries", "content": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) released its latest autism report , where it summarily whitewashed the rise in autism as supposedly due to \u201c more awareness \u201d \u2013 rather than any pharmaceutical or toxicity cause .\nCDC rely on the corporate media to keep any important findings hidden , and attack any activist parents as \u2018 anti-vaxxers.\n\u2019 Media and public health officials perpetuated their entrenched practice of gaslighting autism families when earlier this month they trotted out the worn-out canard that a 23 % rise in autism prevalence over a two-year period \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true increase.\n\u201d The basis for this mean-spirited whopper was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2019 s ( CDC \u2019 s ) release of its biennial report on autism prevalence as of 2018 .\nThe report estimated autism affected 1 in 44 American 8-year-olds born in 2010 ( 2.27 % ) .\nThe CDC \u2019 s prior report estimated prevalence at 1 in 54 8-year-olds born in 2008 ( 1.85 % ) .\nUsing a different methodology , the 2019-2020 National Survey of Children \u2019 s Health situated autism prevalence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 34 ( 2.9 % ) .\nNotwithstanding the media spin , CDC \u2019 s new report can not hide the fact that autism rates have not stopped rising \u2014 and the trend has persisted for decades .\nThis was acknowledged by the report \u2019 s New Jersey author , researcher Walter Zahorodny , who states that U.S. autism prevalence \u2014 far from plateauing \u2014 \u201c has increased continuously over 20 years.\n\u201d Zahorodny , who years ago described the situation as \u201c urgent , \u201d has consistently rejected \u201c better awareness \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as explanations .\nTwenty years ( the period of time during which CDC has had its tracking system in place ) is itself a gross understatement \u2014 autism prevalence in the 1990s ( 1 in 1,000 ) already represented a tenfold increase over the condition \u2019 s estimated prevalence in the 1970s .\nGreeting the new data with a wink and a yawn , the media also ignored the fact that some subgroups and regions are experiencing even more of a \u201c red alert \u201d situation .\nZahorodny called attention , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for California \u2019 s boys is an \u201c unprecedented \u201d 1 in 16 ( 6.4 % ) \u2014 almost double the dreadful rate of 1 in 28 boys overall ( 3.6 % ) .\nThe \u201c Golden State \u201d now has the dubious distinction of having the highest autism rate in the nation .\nMoreover , recent projections by autism researchers Mark Blaxill , Toby Rogers and Cynthia Nevison suggest , if current trends continue , the autism rate could surpass 6 % for ALL American children within a few years .\nAlthough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that harm children \u2019 s neurodevelopment , a preponderance of information from national and international sources pinpoints vaccines as the driving factor behind the autism epidemic .\nThis information includes the CDC \u2019 s own data \u2014 despite the agency \u2019 s numerous fraudulent attempts to make years of troublesome findings \u201c go away.\n\u201d Tragically , officialdom \u2019 s willful refusal to acknowledge or address vaccine-autism safety signals is no longer just an ongoing slap in the face to those directly affected \u2014 it is now affecting the U.S. population as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Pharma are now using the very same playbook to gaslight victims of COVID vaccine injuries .\nIn the early 2000s \u2014 when autism prevalence had surged to an estimated 1 in 150 children \u2014 the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program ( VICP ) consolidated 5,400 claims into something called the Omnibus Autism Proceeding ( OAP ) .\nThe claims were filed by parents who asserted vaccines had injured their children , causing seizures , developmental delays and mitochondrial injuries that ultimately led to a diagnosis of autism .\nUnder the VICP , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims Office of Special Masters .\nThe adversarial process pits petitioners not just against the special masters who adjudicate the claims but also against U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) attorneys who \u201c defend HHS.\n\u201d In the case of the OAP , the special masters told thousands of families they would make a determination about compensation based on nine \u201c test cases \u201d \u2014 almost immediately whittled down to six \u2014 using them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autism causation via vaccine injury .\nKnowing that if their conclusions pinpointed vaccination as the likely culprit in even one of the test cases , the VICP might be on the hook to compensate all 5,400 families \u2014 an outcome that would have bankrupted the VICP and cast a black cloud over the entire childhood vaccination program \u2014 the special masters and DOJ then pulled a couple of fast ones .\nFirst , HHS quietly removed one of the test cases , \u201c Child Doe 77 , \u201d later revealed to be Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbursed over Poling \u2019 s lifetime \u2014 and admitting vaccines were responsible for her autism \u2014 the special masters sealed the documents , so the case \u201c could not be used to establish precedent on any of the other OAP cases.\n\u201d In a parallel move to ensure none of the remaining five test cases would lead to compensation , two DOJ attorneys allegedly distorted the views of HHS \u2019 s star expert witness , Dr. Andrew Zimmerman .\nAt the time , Zimmerman wrote an opinion for one of the test cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of causation in that specific case .\nIn 2019 , however , Zimmerman signed an affidavit disclosing how he had informed the two attorneys during the OAP deliberations that his opinion in that one case was not intended \u201c to be a blanket statement as to all children and all medical science.\n\u201d In fact , Zimmerman told the DOJ attorneys , he believed vaccines could indeed cause autism in some children .\nAs noted by journalist Sharyl Attkisson , Zimmerman \u2019 s consequential scientific opinion \u201c stood to change everything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out.\n\u201d To make sure people did not \u201c find out , \u201d Zimmerman was immediately fired as an expert witness .\nEven worse , DOJ \u2019 s two attorneys intentionally used Zimmerman \u2019 s statements \u2014 written for the single test case \u2014 to misrepresent his broader views , omitting the expert \u2019 s stated belief that vaccines can and did cause autism in a subset of children .\nChildren \u2019 s Health Defense Chairman Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. described the Justice Department \u2019 s OAP cover-up as \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguably in human history.\n\u201d This \u201c fraud \u201d allowed the VICP special masters to dismiss out of hand the petitions of all 5,000-plus families .\nAt the close of 2021 , autism \u2019 s annual costs \u2014 at $ 238 billion \u2014 are projected to more than double to $ 589 billion by 2030 .\nSchool districts and municipalities , tasked with providing special education services , are already \u201c drowning \u201d under the burden of coming up with the necessary funding .\nUnder the circumstances , it is a mystery why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insulting case that autism awareness and better diagnosis account for the ever-higher numbers of children with autism .\nThe fact is that autism is , and always has been , a matter of urgent public concern , with wide-ranging impacts on families , communities and society that will endure for decades to come .\nNor is the autism epidemic limited to the United States \u2014 other countries , such as Ireland , have produced data that mirror the shocking numbers just reported by CDC for California .\nWith the experimental COVID shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disability , both in the U.S. and internationally , many more individuals and families are entering the bizarre twilight zone until now largely inhabited by autism families .\nSimilar to those dealing with autism , the COVID-vaccine-injured are : \u2022 Finding it difficult-to-impossible to gain recognition for their injuries , encountering public ridicule and scorn rather than support for the empirical contention that vaccines triggered their damage .\n\u2022 Discovering that many in the medical community are only too willing to brush off or deny serious physical problems following COVID vaccination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created \u201c post-pandemic stress disorder \u201d are responsible .\n\u2022 Belatedly discovering that vaccine injuries are a significant cause of family bankruptcy and , with manufacturers enjoying complete protection from financial liability , the prospects for injury compensation are slim to none \u2014 the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program that is supposed to provide compensation for \u201c provable \u201d COVID vaccine injuries hasn \u2019 t paid out a single claim .\n\u2022 Learning , with the recent greenlighting of the shots for children ages 5 to 11 , that public health officials , vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c throw children under the bus , \u201d by pushing injections that offer zero benefit , pose outsized risks and jeopardize our country \u2019 s future .\nIn the face of these tragedies , perhaps the only silver lining that can be drawn is that the swelling ranks of the vaccine-injured , along with their families and communities , represent a mighty army \u2014 one that is likely to reject continued gaslighting and to push back against corporate malfeasance and genocidal health policies with growing determination and strength .\nIf one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tidal wave of COVID-vaccine-related injuries , this army may make it more difficult for arrogant authorities to carry out their customary dirty tricks .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

Physicians and Scientists Say Children Should NOT Get COVID Vaccine", "content": "There is a steady and credible consensus emerging among large sections of the medical and scientific communities \u2013 that injuries caused by the experimental COVID-19 vaccines may be irreversible and potentially permanently damaging .\nOne of the leading voices in this movement is Dr. Robert Malone , one of the inventors of the mRNA technology .\nHe is among the 16,000 physicians and medical scientists around the world who \u2019 ve signed a petition publicly declaring healthy children should not be vaccinated for COVID-19 .\nBefore you vaccinate your child \u2014 which is irreversible and potentially permanently damaging \u2014 find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world signed a declaration publicly declaring that healthy children should NOT be vaccinated for COVID-19 .\nOn behalf of these M.D.s and Ph.D.s , I have published a clear statement outlining the scientific facts behind this decision : My name is Robert Malone , and I am speaking to you as a parent , grandparent , physician and scientist .\nI don \u2019 t usually read from a prepared speech , but this is so important that I wanted to make sure that I get every single word and scientific fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a career dedicated to vaccine research and development .\nI \u2019 m vaccinated for COVID and I \u2019 m generally pro-vaccination .\nI have devoted my entire career to developing safe and effective ways to prevent and treat infectious diseases .\nAfter this , I will be posting the text of this statement so you can share it with your friends and family .\nBefore you inject your child \u2014 a decision that is irreversible \u2014 I wanted to let you know the scientific facts about this genetic vaccine , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created : There are three issues parents need to understand : The first is that a viral gene will be injected into your children \u2019 s cells .\nThis gene forces your child \u2019 s body to make toxic spike proteins .\nThese proteins often cause permanent damage in children \u2019 s critical organs , including : \u2022 This vaccine can trigger fundamental changes to their immune system .\nThe most alarming point about this is that once these damages have occurred , they are irreparable : \u2022 You can \u2019 t fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This vaccine can cause reproductive damage that could affect future generations of your family .\nThe second thing you need to know about is the fact that this novel technology has not been adequately tested .\n\u2022 We need at least 5 years of testing/research before we can really understand the risks .\n\u2022 Harms and risks from new medicines often become revealed many years later .\nAsk yourself if you want your own child to be part of the most radical medical experiment in human history .\nOne final point : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinate your child is a lie .\n\u2022 Your children represent no danger to their parents or grandparents .\n\u2022 It \u2019 s actually the opposite .\nTheir immunity , after getting COVID , is critical to save your family if not the world from this disease .\nIn summary : There is no benefit for your children or your family to be vaccinating your children against the small risks of the virus , given the known health risks of the vaccine that as a parent , you and your children may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives .\nAs a parent and grandparent , my recommendation to you is to resist and fight to protect your children .\nMore on the twisted logic of vaccinating the children to protect the elderly \u201c Never in human history have old people required young people to take risks , make sacrifices and die to preserve older people .\nWe have a fiduciary duty to our children .\nOld people sacrifice themselves for children in a moral society , in a robust society , in a society that we are proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take risks to preserve old people .\nWe need to stand up and take a moral choice and an ethical choice for our children.\n\u201d \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. testimony before Louisiana State Legislature I first became conscious of the twisted logic of vaccinating the children to protect the elderly when I saw the CNN \u201c indirect marketing \u201d campaign to vaccinate children with an unlicensed experimental Pfizer product .\nAfter the shock of the realization that what was going on was that Pfizer used CNN as a surrogate to advertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand and causing the USG/CDC to purchase additional Pfizer unlicensed EUA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines , I took time to review the clip more carefully and think through what was storyboarded and scripted .\nI am no longer confident that children were the target market \u2014 I think it was the elderly who watch TV and soak up the constant barrage of CNN fearporn regarding SARS-CoV-2 .\nThe CNN/Sesame Street piece is actually promoting the logic that an elderly grandmother should schedule and transport her grandchild to receive an unlicensed experimental medical product , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocating that the child should accept this procedure .\nAfter the shock of the realization that what was going on was that Pfizer used CNN as a surrogate to advertise directly to children , thereby driving consumer demand and causing the USG/CDC to purchase additional Pfizer unlicensed EUA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines , I took time to review the clip more carefully and think through what was storyboarded and scripted .\nI am no longer confident that children were the target market \u2014 I think it was the elderly who watch TV and soak up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARS-CoV-2 .\nThe CNN/Sesame Street piece is actually promoting the logic that an elderly grandmother should schedule and transport her grandchild to receive an unlicensed experimental medical product , and that it is the grandmother who is advocating that the child should accept this procedure .\nFew if any have come out with such a brief , plain-speaking statement about the reality of what parents and their children are being asked or forced to do by government bureaucrats .\nBut so many have been subjected to so much propaganda \u2014 such intentional hypnotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good idea to vaccinate our children with an experimental product that is associated with unacceptable and irreparable toxicities in order to protect the small fraction of the population at high risk of death and hospitalization .\nAccording to the latest CDC data , more than 60 % of the total U.S. population has been vaccinated , and about 45 % of the entire population has already been infected by the virus , recovered and developed natural immunity .\nThe vaccines do not prevent you from becoming infected , replicating high levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI will say it again \u2014 the elderly are highly vaccinated .\nThe problem is that the vaccines are not doing what they are supposed to do \u2014 prevent infection and spread of the virus .\nThis is even more the case with the Omicron variant .\nSo what to do ?\nStart jabbing children who \u2014 unless they have other major problems \u2014 shrug off COVID-19 disease like they do most other RNA respiratory viruses ?\nOr start allowing physicians to treat COVID-19 patients in the outpatient setting to prevent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where ( almost exclusively in the U.S. alone ) they are immunosuppressed with high levels of dexamethasone , placed into a coma-like state and hooked up to a ventilator , and treated with Remdesivir ( which is clearly toxic and mimics many of the toxicities of the virus ) ?\nAnd it reflects a profound arrogance on the part of the Pharma-Govie-World Health elite .\nThey assert that they understand immunology , virology and evolutionary biology so well that they can freely tinker with the lives of our children using an experimental technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe nor effective based on standards and bioethical consensus that have been developed and applied over decades .\nThey believe that they can inject novel unproven technology and improve the highly evolved human immune system that has developed over millennia to resist respiratory RNA virus pressure .\nArrogance is the kindest term I can think of .\n\u201c I know no one \u2019 s going to show me everything .\nWe all come and go unknown .\nEach so deep and superficial .\nBetween the forceps and the stone .\nWell , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tributes to finality , to eternity .\nAnd then I looked at myself here .\nChicken scratching for my immortality.\n\u201d \u2014 Joni Mitchell \u201c Hejira \u201d None of us are immortal .\nDespite the objectives of the transhumanism agenda .\nDeath can not be avoided .\nWe pass through this world , and hopefully , leave it a bit better when we are gone .\nOur children are the only true legacy , the only real form of immortality .\nPlease protect them , and do not ask them to make sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know this is wrong .\nSo do the right thing .\nAnd take this seriously .\nThink long and hard before taking an action that can never be undone .\nRobert W.

allowing it in hand sanitizers at levels up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .2 The allowance was made due to the COVID-19 pandemic , which triggered unprecedented demand for disinfectant products like hand sanitizers .\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 % alcohol to prevent COVID-19 if soap and water aren \u2019 t available.3 This , combined with panic and fear in the early days of the pandemic , led to shortages of hand sanitizer and supplies weren \u2019 t enough to meet consumer demand .\nAs evidence of its increased prevalence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitizer increased 79 % in March 2020 compared to March 2019.4 This triggered the FDA to loosen its guidelines for the products , allowing increased levels of toxins like benzene , despite its cancer-causing potential .\nWhen hand sanitizer shortages emerged at the start of the pandemic , the FDA \u2019 s temporary guidance allowed manufacturers to produce the products from lower grades of ethanol , provided any toxins it contained fell under their interim limits .\nIn addition to benzene at 2 ppm , acetaldehyde , which is genotoxic and potentially carcinogenic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 ppm , even as the agency stated , \u201c Given the large number of applications of this product expected by consumers and health care personnel during the public health emergency , exposure to hand sanitizer with high levels of acetaldehyde poses a significant safety concern.\n\u201d 5 To explain their loosened restrictions , the FDA stated:6 \u201c \u2026 FDA is working with industry to ensure that harmful levels of impurities are not present in ethanol used in hand sanitizer .\nUpon further review of the data , we are temporarily providing flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels established \u2026 Based on our review of available data , we have determined these interim impurity levels can be tolerated for a relatively short period of time , given the emphasis on hand hygiene during the COVID-19 public health emergency and to avoid exacerbating access issues for alcohol-based hand sanitizer .\nAccordingly , during this public health emergency , FDA does not intend

provided all other circumstances in the guidance are present \u2026 \u201d The move opened the door for the manufacture of hand sanitizer using cheap , low-grade ethanol that poses a health risk to

sharp increase in hand sanitizer products labeled as containing ethanol ( ethyl alcohol ) but that tested positive for methanol contamination.10 Methanol , or wood alcohol , is toxic and can be life-threatening if ingested .\nBy August 2020 , they had warned consumers and health care professionals about hand sanitizer products found to be contaminated with 1-propanol , which can cause central nervous system depression and death if ingested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in March 2021 , involved Durisan Antimicrobial Solutions Hand Sanitizer manufactured by Sanit Technologies LLC , which was found to contain high levels of Burkholderia cepacia complex and Ralstonia pickettii , bacteria that can cause serious infections , including infection of the skin , soft tissues , lungs or bloodstream.11 Then , in October 2021 , the FDA found \u201c unacceptable \u201d levels of benzene , acetaldehyde and acetal in certain hand sanitizers produced by Artnaturals.12 David Light , CEO of Valisure lab , which has been testing hand sanitizers for contaminants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitizer products , including liquid and non-liquid products .\nThey found that 44 batches , or 17 % , contained benzene .\nThe highest benzene level detected was 16.1 ppm , which is more than eight times the FDA \u2019 s interim limit of 2 ppm.14 Benzene is found in crude oil , gasoline and cigarette smoke , and is also widely used to make chemicals used in the manufacture of plastics , synthetic fibers , lubricants , rubbers , dyes , detergents , drugs and pesticides .\nBenzene interferes with cells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red blood cells , triggering anemia , for instance .\nIt can also cause immune system damage , including changes in antibody levels and loss of white blood cells .\nAfter long-term exposure , benzene causes cancer in humans , particularly leukemia , and is known to lead to irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in ovary size in women .\nFurther , as noted by the CDC:15 Benzene \u2019 s use in hand sanitizers is particularly egregious considering it can cause harm via skin absorption and inhalation , both of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as intended .\nValisure has asked to FDA to immediately recall the contaminated batches of hand sanitizer they revealed , and update its guidance to include an exposure limit for benzene along with a concentration limit .\nThey also found that at least 45 % of the benzene-contaminated hand sanitizers contained additional ingredients intended to improve its smell , taste or appearance , increasing the risk of ingestion by children .\nIn fact , Valisure stated , \u201c Some of the highly contaminated batches Valisure analyzed appear to be specifically formulated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2021 , Procter & Gamble voluntarily recalled certain lots of Old Spice and Secret aerosol spray antiperspirants and Old Spice Below Deck aerosol spray products sold in the U.S. , due to the presence of benzene.17 It \u2019 s ironic that the FDA has announced the voluntary recall , even acknowledging that \u201c exposure to benzene can occur by inhalation , orally , and through the skin , \u201d 18 yet it knowingly allowed increased levels of benzene in hand sanitizers throughout the pandemic \u2014 a time when people were using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning .\nMeanwhile , it warns that if you have any of the hand sanitizers on its \u201c do not use \u201d list , you should stop using it and \u201c dispose of it , ideally in a hazardous waste container.\n\u201d 19 The FDA does not have the authority to force recalls , though it can warn about contaminated products .\nHowever , unless you \u2019 re in the habit of checking the FDA \u2019 s website for consumer warnings , or you happen to see something in the news , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the hand sanitizer you \u2019 re using to \u201c stay safe \u201d may be exposing you to cancer-causing chemicals .\nDo You Really Need Hand Sanitizer ?\nOveruse of hand sanitizers and other disinfectants can backfire .\nThere are potential adverse effects to human health from inhaling disinfectants , as such chemicals are known to accumulate in the lungs , liver , kidneys , stomach , brain and blood .\nExposures were certainly elevated during the pandemic for many people , who were exposed to disinfectants by inhalation and oral routes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes .\nThere are also significant environmental concerns due to the \u201c unusual release and dissemination of higher concentrations of biocide-based products into the surface and underground waters and also wastewater treatment systems \u201d during the pandemic.20 When disinfectants and biocides enter the environment , they can wipe out beneficial bacterial species that are keeping drug-resistant microorganisms in

technocrats continue deriding skeptics of the state-sponsored pharmaceutical agenda .\nThe shorthand label \u201c anti-vax \u201d once had a clear and concise meaning : namely , those who reject the prevailing western scientific orthodoxy that vaccines are a safe and effective means of protecting humans against infectious diseases by training the immune system to combat a pathogen in advance .\nAs vaccines become more prevalent against an increasingly wide range of diseases \u2014 measles , mumps , polio , chickenpox \u2014 a dissenting political and scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premises of vaccines and attempts to persuade others not to vaccinate themselves or their children on the ground that they are ineffective , dangerous and/or motivated by corporate profit rather than legitimate concerns about public health .\nBut exactly as we have seen with so many other political labels \u2014 terrorist , racist , fascist , white nationalist , anti-Semite \u2014 this once-descriptive , precise and useful phrase has metamorphized far beyond its original meaning into something barely recognizable or cogent .\nThat transformation has been deliberate , with a clear motive : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political insult designed to compel submission to decrees from institutions of authority and stigmatize dissenters , threatening them with reputation destruction .\nThe rapid expansion of the term \u201c anti-vax \u201d into a coercive political weapon has been years in the making , but the COVID pandemic was the steroid it needed to blossom into one of the most reputation-crippling labels one can affix to a political target .\nJust as is true of accusing people of being terrorists , white nationalists , fascists or anti-Semites not because one espouses views traditionally designated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sort of dissent , the destructive power of the COVID iteration of \u201c anti-vax \u201d resides precisely in its vagueness , its lack of precise contours , its emptiness and meaninglessness .\nA term that means nothing can , by definition and by design , encompass anyone and everyone depending solely on the needs of the moment .\nThe utter obliteration of any coherent definition is evidenced by the fact that one can now be labelled \u201c anti-vax \u201d even though one a ) believes in the foundational science of vaccines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and makes the decision that one \u2019 s children will be as well , and c ) states publicly that they have chosen to be vaccinated .\nHow is it possible to pull off such a seemingly inane and internally contradictory attack :

from its scientific meaning ( \u201c one who rejects the efficacy of vaccines \u201d ) into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the operational definition of the term has become : one who questions any of the decrees of public health authorities on any matters or who believes that adult citizens should retain the choice to decide for themselves whether to be vaccinated .\nIn other words , the term \u201c anti-vax \u201d now means nothing other than : one who questions any policies adopted by state officials in the name of fighting COVID .\nUnfortunately for the liberal-left which has constructed this manipulative and coercive framework , this now requires that the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the international left \u2019 s most beloved political figures : former Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn .\nThey must

when it comes to the poor performance of the US economy .\nSince the 2020 campaign , Biden has only managed to cling to one issue to claim competence : the pandemic .\nNow that the pandemic narrative is waning , the elderly Democrat leader is struggling to pivot to any other substantiative issue .\nNow he finds himself deflecting daily criticism over the rapid increase in inflation , and skyrocketing fuel and energy costs for the nation \u2019 s working and middle classes .\nThe situation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already pondering whether \u2013 after just 12 months in office \u2013 he has already eclipsed Jimmy Carter as the most incompetent president on managing the country \u2019 s economy .\nThe poll numbers seem to suggest this has already happened .\nPresident Joe Biden \u2019 s economic ratings are officially worse than Jimmy Carter \u2019 s , an ominous sign for Biden \u2019 s re-election hopes and overall presidential legacy .\nWhat do the numbers show ?\nAccording to the latest CNN/SSRS poll , Biden \u2019 s economic approval rating among registered voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic disapproval rating is 54 % \u2014 a net approval rating of -9 % .\nCNN noted that its poll number is actually four points better than the average of all economic approval ratings surveyed in December , which stands at -13 % .\nThat means Biden currently boasts the \u201c the lowest net economic rating of any president at this point through their first term since at least Jimmy Carter in 1977 , \u201d CNN explained .\nBut it gets worse .\nNot only does Biden sport the lowest net economic rating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it \u2019 s 18 points worse than the average president \u2019 s at this point in the presidency .\nAccording to CNN , the average president boasts a +5 % economic approval rating at the one-year mark .\nOther important data from the poll : \u2022 75 % of registered voters said they are worried about the economy , while just 25 % said they are not worried about the economy ; \u2022 63 % of registered voters described the current economic conditions as \u201c poor , \u201d while just 37 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; \u2022 45 % of registered voters believe Biden \u2019 s

have some doubts and reservations \u201d about Biden , while just 34 % said Biden \u201c is a leader you can trust.\n\u201d Additionally , 67 % of respondents told pollsters that government spending

"title": "CONFIRMED: UK Gov\u2019t Already Planning for FOURTH Covid Jab in New Year", "content": "It \u2019 s all but confirmed .\nGovernments are now revealing their true objective : endless boosters for an endless pandemic .\nThis week the UK government admitted they are already in the planning stage for the next round of experimental Covid booster injections .\nPublic Health mavens are citing the alleged \u201c Omicron \u201d viral invasion , as well as aggressive vaccine policies in Israel and Germany , as a pretext to move ahead with jab number four .\nIsrael announced that citizens over 60 yrs-old and healthcare workers are now eligible for a fourth Covid jab .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d said Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in a recent tweet .\nIn Germany , health minister Karl Lauterbach has warned a fourth dose will be necessary to \u2018 tackle the Omicron variant.\n\u2019 German officials have also shortened the period between a second Covid shot and a booster to just three months \u2013 down from six .\nBritain is considering the rollout of a fourth round of vaccinations against Covid-19 after both Israel and Germany gave the green light to a second set of boosters .\nExperts on the Joint Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will examine evidence on levels of immunity given by three jabs as well as data on hospitalisations for the new omicron variant before making any decision on a fourth .\nThe government \u2019 s new booster push will also be targeting children , including modified multiple injection schedule for \u2018 vulnerable \u2019 children : As it turns out , the government have already been quietly testing their four jab policy , initially to cater for those whom the state deems as having a \u2018 weakened immune system \u2019 : If approved , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately , as the only stipulation is that the fourth jab be given just months after that last booster .\nThe first boosters were given in mid September 2021 .\nAnother very interesting development in all this , is that after a year of pretending that the fake Relative Risk Reduction ( RRR ) number being touted by pharmaceutical firms ( ie .\n\u201c our vaccine was 95 % effective in clinical trials \u201d ) as some sort of legitimate measure of actual vaccine effectiveness , the government are sheepishly admitting that statistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young children .\nIn a shrewd damage control move , the JCVI have suddenly conceded that vaccinating 1 million children between 5 and 11 yrs-old would only prevent two children from ending up in ICU care .\nThis bombshell admission indicates that in this instance at least , the government are relying on a more accurate Absolute Risk Reduction ( ARR ) metric , instead of the fraudulent RRR figure routinely peddled by drug cartel members Pfizer , AstraZeneca , Moderna and others , and dutifully repeated by government and media .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s tacit admission that the vaccines do nothing for children is a signal that the state may be hedging against the legal and political blowback which is sure to come following a reckless government attempt to turn their entire population into a giant GMO pharmaceutical clinical experiment by rushing the experimental injection through under an \u2019 emergency use \u2019 license .\nThe increased risk of a myocarditis heart condition and other vaccine injuries in children shows that the children may be a higher risk of a vaccine event than from Covid itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lost on mainstream media and censorship departments at Twitter and Facebook .\nClearly , the public were lied to from day one about nearly ever major aspect of the crisis .\nAll of this amounts to a stunning development which shows that the government may be trying to compensate for its inability to implement the draconian vaccine passport medical apartheid laws currently in place in major European countries , by instead fast-tracking a new round of experimental corporate injections .\nStill , few are asking the fundamental question : if you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn \u2019 t that mean the \u2018 vaccine \u2019 isn \u2019 t very effective at all ?\nThe further their agenda presses forward , the clearer it seems that the push for endless vaccines is really designed to preserve the need for Vaccine Passports as a tool of social and politicial control .\nUK officials have been using the \u201c Omicron \u201d variant brand to sell the current round of boosters on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry , despite that fact that scientists and medical experts have been saying how weak the alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming that they haven \u2019 t make a decision yet , and that they are still waiting for a fuller picture on \u2018 The Science.\n\u2019 The recent visit to government officials by vaccine mogul Bill Gates should indicate that there is tremendous pressure from the pharmaceutical drug cartels to push the next round of experimental vaccines through , as drug firms are certainly keen to record their guaranteed sales for the next financial quarter .\nEvery government mandate or campaign translates into billions in guaranteed profit for the vaccine industry .\nPLEASE @ @ @ @ @ @ @", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url":

major institutions could follow suit .\nIf that happens , it will surely be a death blow to the prevailing Gates-Fauci crisis orthodoxy .\nThe NFL is battling the latest COVID-19 surge with an

.\nThat position represents a significant departure from the pandemic-long stance of public health authorities , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus without being aware they are infected .\nSills first

COVID mandates is because vaccine makers want to get the shots onto the childhood vaccination schedule \u2022 None Once a vaccine is added to the childhood schedule , the vaccine maker is shielded from financial liability for injuries , unless the manufacturer knows about vaccine safety issues and withholds that information \u2022 None Products must satisfy four criteria in order to get emergency use authorization : There must be an emergency ; a vaccine must be at least 30 % to 50 % effective ; the known and potential benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and potential risks of the product ; and there can be no adequate , approved and available alternative treatments ( drugs or vaccines ) .\nUnless all four criteria are met , EUA can not be granted or maintained \u2022 None According to a U.S. federal court decision , the Pfizer shot and BioNTech \u2019 s Comirnaty are not interchangeable \u2022 None Comirnaty is not fully approved and licensed .\nIt \u2019 s only \u201c ready for approval.\n\u201d Comirnaty is licensed to be manufactured , introduced into state commerce and marketed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given to anyone , and it \u2019 s not yet available in the United States .\nThey \u2019 re waiting for it to be added to the childhood vaccination schedule , to get the liability shield In this interview , Alix Mayer explains why our children are being so aggressively targeted for the COVID-19 injection even though they \u2019 re not at risk of serious SARS-CoV-2 infection , and clarifies the status of Comirnaty .\nMayer , board president of Children \u2019 s Health Defense \u2014California Chapter , is herself vaccine injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but from a series of vaccines she received 20 years ago .\n( Incidentally , Mayer grew up in the Oscar Mayer family in the 5th generation descended from the original Oscar Mayer , a German immigrant who started as a butcher boy .\nDespite Mayer \u2019 s vaccine injury , her family does not share her views on vaccine safety issues . )\nMayer graduated from Duke University with a BA and from Northwestern University with an MBA in finance and management strategy .\nShe worked for Apple in the mid-1990s .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to acting manager of worldwide customer research .\nIn preparation for a family trip to Bali , her doctor recommended getting six vaccines : hepatitis A vaccine , hepatitis B vaccine , diphtheria , tetanus , polio and oral typhoid , which she did .\nEventually , 13 years later , she finally realized it was these shots that triggered her health problems .\n\u201c They gave me brain damage and total disability , \u201d she says .\n\u201c I spent three years in my early 30s being 80 % housebound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if I was ever going to get better .\nI went through a whole bunch of diagnoses : lupus , chronic fatigue syndrome , Lyme disease .\nUltimately , none of those made sense and none of the treatments made me any better , until we put the pieces together and figured out that I was actually vaccine injured .\nIt \u2019 s literally just a cause and effect .\nIf you look back at my history and lay out my vaccine schedule , you can see that my health declined two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had encephalitis and encephalopathy \u2026 digestive issues , hypersomnia \u2014 sleeping 16 hours a day \u2014 flu-like symptoms , a 24/7 migraine , joint pain .\nI really had no life at all in my early 30s until I went on a gluten-free diet .\nThat started my health recovery .\nI then became an award-winning medical journalist with a bunch of different blogs , and then a health consultant .\nIn 2018 , I retired from all that and joined Children \u2019 s Health Defense.\n\u201d While many vaccines have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , data from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System ( VAERS ) suggest there \u2019 s never been a vaccine as dangerous as the experimental mRNA gene transfer injections for COVID .\nWhat \u2019 s more , while lack of transparency and accountability has been a chronic problem within the vaccine industry , the obvious hazards associated with vaccines are really being highlighted by the COVID jabs .\nMany now know of someone who has been injured by the COVID jab , and most were injured so shortly after the shot that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe staggering number of injuries reported among adults who have received the COVID shot in turn highlights the insanity of rolling it out to young children .\nAccording to Mayer , the reason they \u2019 re trying to mandate the COVID shot for children is to evade liability for injuries , because once a vaccine is on the childhood vaccination schedule , vaccine makers have immunity against lawsuits for injuries .\nThe COVID shots currently have legal immunity against liability because they \u2019 re still under emergency use authorization ( EUA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comirnaty has been fully licensed , you \u2019 d be mistaken .\nMayer explains : \u201c I put together a slide deck about Emergency Use Authorization ( which you can see in the video interview above ) because there is so much confusion over this and what \u2019 s really going on .\nOnce you understand the genesis of EUA and the standards they have to meet in order to keep these products on the market , then you understand the behaviors [ we \u2019 re now seeing ] .\nThey \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EUAs for these products and also introduce other very confusing kinds of approval to get away with stuff .\nSo , let me just start to clarify it right now .\nThis presentation is all about these three strangleholds that the vaccine makers and our government are never going to let go of \u2026 These are the things they \u2019 re guarding with their lives .\nFirst of all , they need to guard the emergency \u2026 so they can not have any early treatments .\nThose can not exist .\nThey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and children will be used as pawns to get them full liability protection .\nVaccine makers love EUA products because they have this huge liability shield .\nIf you \u2019 re injured by an EUA vaccine , you can \u2019 t sue the manufacturer , you can \u2019 t sue the person who gave it to you , you can \u2019 t sue the institution where you got the shot .\nYou have to go through something called the CICP , the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program , where they \u2019 ll only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for pharmaceuticals and lost wages .\nNow , if you \u2019 re vaccine injured , let me tell you right now , you are not going to be using pharmaceuticals because they do not work for vaccine injury .\nThey will make you sicker .\nYou \u2019 ll be on two dozen pharmaceuticals before you know it and you \u2019 re going to be sick from those .\nThey do not work .\nThe only thing that \u2019 s going to get you better if you \u2019 re vaccine injured is natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treatment you \u2019 re going to need , and that \u2019 s not even covered , even if you were to get compensation .\nEverybody I know with chronic illness , whether it \u2019 s a child or an adult who has chronic fatigue syndrome , vaccine injury , Lyme disease , they \u2019 re paying $ 50,000 out of pocket per year .\nIf you can \u2019 t work and you have to pay for your treatment out of pocket , I don \u2019 t know how you ever get by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose homes , they go into bankruptcy.\n\u201d Since its inception , the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program ( VICP ) , which pays for injuries caused by vaccines on the childhood vaccination schedule , has paid out about one-third of claims .\nIt \u2019 s a long , arduous process that oftentimes takes years and in the end rarely provides adequate compensation .\n[ Editor \u2019 s note : The first COVID case was recently determined \u201c eligible \u201d for compensation , but the case has not yet been adjudicated.1 ] In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stages of product liability , and whether the mRNA shots can be mandated .\nAs mentioned , vaccine makers have no liability as long as their product is under EUA , as the product is investigational .\n\u201c Investigational is a synonym for experimental , \u201d Mayer says .\n\u201c And the word experimental ties it directly into the Nuremberg Code , which says that we can not be experimented on [ without consent ] .\nWe always have the right to accept or refuse a medical treatment .\n[ The Nuremberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it \u2019 s a code under which the whole world is supposed to be operating by .\nAnd it is actually codified into some local and federal laws as well \u2026 So , what everybody needs to know is that coercion and duress are considered de facto mandates and illegal .\nDe facto means that it \u2019 s basically the same as an outright mandate .\nIt \u2019 s illegal medical segregation , medical apartheid [ because that is a form of coercion or duress . ]\nSo , if you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine passport , only let you eat outside , and they might not let you use the bathroom , that \u2019 s medical segregation .\nThat is illegal and I do not support businesses that do that and you shouldn \u2019 t either .\nAny access privileges that are different between the vaccinated and unvaccinated are illegal , and any visual indication of vaccine status like a sticker or a bracelet \u2026 that \u2019 s also illegal because that creates segregation and medical apartheid , [ since they are all forms of coercion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass violation of the law does not make something legal .\nThe next stage is full licensure ( FDA approval ) .\nOnce a product is fully licensed , the company becomes liable for injuries .\nAt that point , the product can be legally mandated .\nOf course , knowing how dangerous the COVID shots are , no manufacturer wants to be financially liable for injuries .\nThey \u2019 d be sued out of business .\nTo get immunity against liability again , the vaccine manufacturers need to get their product onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also allow government to mandate the shots .\nAs noted by Mayer : In Doe v. Rumsfeld,2 the court held that service members could refuse an EUA product without punitive consequences such as dishonorable discharge or other punishments .\nTherefore , there were no consequences to refusing an EUA product , other than the natural consequence of possibly getting the disease .\nHowever , in July 2021 , the U.S. Department of Justice attempted to redefine the term \u201c consequences \u201d just for the COVID shot , to suggest that punitive consequences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your working or learning location , are legal when a person refuses an EUA vaccine .\nThere are four standards that must be fulfilled for an EUA .\nIf any of these criteria are not met , EUA can not be granted or maintained .\nFirst , the secretary of Health and Human Services has to declare and maintain a state of emergency .\nIf the emergency were to go away , all EUA products would have to come off the market .\nAnd that doesn \u2019 t just mean vaccines .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgical masks .\nThe second standard is evidence of effectiveness .\nHistorically , vaccines had to show a 70 % or greater effectiveness , as measured by a fourfold increase in antibody levels , in order to qualify .\nFor an EUA vaccine , the efficacy threshold is only 30 % to 50 % .\nIn another departure from prior vaccine approvals , the COVID vaccine clinical trials relied on the RT-PCR test , not antibodies , to demonstrate effectiveness in the small \u201c challenge phase \u201d of the trials .\nNow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 95 % effective when it first rolled out , but that was relative risk reduction , not absolute risk reduction .\nConfounding these two parameters is a common strategy used to make a product sound far better than it actually is .\nThe absolute risk reduction for Pfizer \u2019 s shot was just 0.84 % .3 For example , if a study divided people into two groups of 1,000 and two people in the group who didn \u2019 t get a fictional vaccine got infected , while only one in the vaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction would be reported as 100 % .\nIn terms of absolute risk reduction , the fictional vaccine only prevented 1 in 1,000 from getting the infection \u2014 a very poor absolute risk reduction .\nThe take-home message here is that even though the minimal threshold for effectiveness is ludicrously low , in terms of absolute risk reduction , these shots still don \u2019 t measure up .\nWithin six months , even the relative risk reduction bottoms out at zero .\nWhat \u2019 s more , there \u2019 s evidence that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The third standard is that the known and potential benefits of the product must outweigh the known and potential risks of the product .\nIn the case of COVID shots , there \u2019 s overwhelming evidence showing they do more harm than good .\nThe fourth and last standard that must be met is there can be no adequate , approved and available alternative treatments ( drugs or vaccines ) .\n\u201c This is why hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were quashed , \u201d Mayer says .\nThis is also another reason Comirnaty is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , because if it were , then all the other COVID shots that are under EUA would have to be removed from the market .\nWith regard to Comirnaty , is it or is it not fully approved and licensed ?\nThe answer is more complex than a simple yes or no .\nMayer explains : \u201c Comirnaty \u2019 s quasi approval is just for BioNTech .\nIt doesn \u2019 t have to do with Pfizer , and this is why I \u2019 m doing this presentation because I \u2019 m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with that .\nThis is the race to get liability protection .\nRemember , that \u2019 s the other stranglehold that they want .\nThey really want to get this liability protection .\nOnce the COVID shots are fully approved , the manufacturer has full liability .\nThere \u2019 s all this confusion about Comirnaty .\nWas it fully approved ?\nIs it on the market ?\nIs it interchangeable with the Pfizer shot ?\nAnd does it make the COVID shot mandate legal ?\nIt \u2019 s all the same answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no .\nThe FDA issued an intentionally confusing biological license application approval for Comirnaty .\nIt was an unprecedented approval to both license the Comirnaty shot , saying it \u2019 s \u2018 interchangeable \u2019 with the Pfizer shot .\nBut they also said it \u2019 s \u2018 legally distinct.\n\u2019 In that same approval , they retain the vaccine \u2019 s liability shield by designating it EUA as well .\nThey want it to be fully approved , but they want the liability protection , so they did this BS dual approval .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be manufactured , introduced into state commerce and marketed , but it \u2019 s not licensed to be given to anyone , and it \u2019 s not available in the United States .\nIt \u2019 s available in the U.K. , New Zealand and other places , but it is not available in the United States because they \u2019 re really scared of liability .\nNow , are you ready for this one ?\nThe BLA actually states that Comirnaty is only \u2018 ready for approval.\n\u2019 5 It doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the document .\nAnd they buried this language in a pediatric section to confuse people even more .\nHere \u2019 s what they said ; \u2018 We \u2019 re deferring submission of your pediatric studies for ages younger than 16 .\nFor this application , because this product is ready for approval for use in individuals 16 years of age and older , as pediatric studies for younger ages have not been completed.\n\u2019 Why did they do this ?\nSixteen is a very important number .\nYou would think the age break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very typical age break for everything else that we do in this country .\nWhy 16 ?\nThe reason they did 16 is because 16- and 17-year-olds are still on the children \u2019 s vaccination schedule .\nAnd then the manufacturer gets full liability protection .\nThat \u2019 s why this is ready to be approved for 16 and up , not 18 and up.\n\u201d This confusion is clearly intentional .\nOn the one hand , the FDA claims Comirnaty is interchangeable with the Pfizer shot , yet it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to weigh in on the matter , and a federal judge recently rejected the DoD claim that the two shots are interchangeable .\nThey \u2019 re not interchangeable .\nThat means Comirnaty vaccine is still EUA .\nIt doesn \u2019 t have full approval and it \u2019 s not on the market .\n\u201c Military members involved in lawsuits are challenging the military \u2019 s COVID vaccine mandate .\nThey filed an amended complaint seeking a new injunction after the judge last month rejected the assertion that the Pfizer COVID shot and BioNTech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we \u2019 re still hammering on this legally , but a court has ruled that they \u2019 re not interchangeable .\n[ Editor \u2019 s note : This information is accurate at the time of the interview , but legal challenges are ongoing and courts may issue new rulings .\nDecember 22 , 2021 , the U.S. Supreme Court announced6 it has slated January 7 , 2022 , to hear arguments challenging Biden \u2019 s vaccine and testing mandates . ]\nSo , how do we know that Comirnaty is not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approval states you have the right to accept or refuse the product .\nThat means it \u2019 s an EUA .\nSecond , it \u2019 s not available in the U.S. because Comirnaty doesn \u2019 t have liability protection .\nThird , if it were available , it \u2019 s an alternative [ treatment ] and all other EUA shots would have to come off the market .\nNo .\n4 , the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) would have to recommend it for ages 16 to 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the children \u2019 s recommended schedule .\nThat \u2019 s how we know it \u2019 s not fully approved and on the market .\nHere is the label for Comirnaty .\nIt says it \u2019 s emergency use authorization .\nIt doesn \u2019 t say it \u2019 s fully approved , because it \u2019 s not .\nBut look at the safety information they are recognizing : Myocarditis and pericarditis have occurred in some people who \u2019 ve received the vaccine , more commonly in males under 40 years of age than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is saying that young men are getting heart inflammation .\nAnd what we know from all the anecdotal reports is 300 athletes have died or collapsed on the field , and children in schools have died of heart attacks .\nThat \u2019 s what \u2019 s going on here .\nAnd the reason they have to declare this is because they know it .\nThey know it \u2019 s happening .\nAnd the only way they can be sued is if they know there \u2019 s a problem with their vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSo , they declare it here , in very mild language as if it \u2019 s not that big of a deal , but it \u2019 s a very big deal .\nYoung people are dying [ from the shots ] who have a 99.9973 % chance of recovering from COVID \u2026 The holy grail is to get the shot on the CDC recommended schedule for children , because then it gets full liability protection according to the 1986 Act .\nThis is why they \u2019 re going after our children when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2026 Every medical intervention is a risk benefit equation , and it doesn \u2019 t calculate for kids at all .\nThey should never be getting COVID shots .\nThe shots don \u2019 t prevent transmission .\nThey don \u2019 t prevent cases .\nThey don \u2019 t prevent hospitalization or death.\n\u201d How You Can Help Children \u2019 s Health Defense has sued the FDA over the approval of Comirnaty , alleging that this is a \u201c bait and switch

explained:17 Reports of both cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ) have been reported following COVID-19 shots , including both fatal and nonfatal cases .\nIn a commentary published in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice,18 Japanese researchers revealed that , as of May 2021 , 10 deaths were reported following the shots \u2014 and the manner of deaths raised a red flag .\nAmong the five men who died , it was from causes other than stroke , but four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ICH .\n\u201c This imbalance is incompatible with the mortality data on cardiovascular diseases in the National Statistics , which show no apparent disparity between sexes or between hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke , \u201d they wrote.19 Their analysis revealed \u201c a disproportionately high incidence of death by ICH in Japanese women who received tozinameran [ Pfizer \u2019 s COVID0-19 shot ] , suggesting a potential association of ICH with the vaccine.\n\u201d 20 They also believe that a causal link between the deaths from ICH and the shot is possible and warrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that blood clot formation with mRNA vaccines is inevitable .\nThe mRNA COVID-19 injections affect your body at the cellular level.21 In each dose of the Moderna COVID-19 shot are 40 trillion mRNA \u2014 or messenger RNA \u2014 molecules .\nEach mRNA \u201c package \u201d is designed to be absorbed into your cell , but only 25 % stay in your arm at the site of the injection .\nThe other 75 % , is collected by your lymphatic system and fed into your circulation , Dr. Charles Hoffe , a family physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe cells where mRNA is absorbed are those around your blood vessels \u2014 the capillary network , which are the tiniest blood vessels in your body .\nWhen the mRNA is absorbed into your vascular endothelium \u2014 the inner lining of your capillaries \u2014 the \u201c packages \u201d open and genes are released .\nEach gene can produce many

@ , or so the theory goes .\nBut there \u2019 s a problem .\nIn a coronavirus , the spike protein becomes part of the viral capsule , Hoffe says , but when you get the shot , \u201c it \u2019 s not in a virus , it \u2019 s in your cells.\n\u201d The spike protein , in turn , can lead to the development of blood clots:22 In a preprint study released in October 2021 , researchers from Nagasaki International University , Japan , studied adverse events that occur in young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot.23 Using data from 7,965 individuals , they found that 83 % experienced local adverse events while 65 % experienced systemic adverse events .\nThose particularly at risk included women , youth under the age of 20 \u2014 who often experienced adverse events after the first dose \u2014 and those who experienced adverse events after the first dose .\nSuch information is crucial to proper informed consent , something that not only has been lacking during the pandemic , but actively censored .\nIt

\u2019 s political Left and the threat posed to civilization by a cult-like propensity for excessive virtue signalling .\nIn my previous essay ( Covid-19 and the Green Void ) , I examined the dogmatic fervor of the Left endorsing draconian and discriminatory vaccine mandates and health passes .\nA missing piece of my analysis was how the Left became so singularly duped into forming the vanguard of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this non sequitur ?\nOut of all possible political demographics , the Left ( including Greens ) would seem the least likely to embrace mandatory segregation , coerced medical procedures , government surveillance , and the censoring of scientists .\nThe Left would seem the least likely to give pharmaceutical corporations a free pass on multi-billion-dollar investigational

vaccines are now permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn total , there have now been more than 700,000 reports of adverse events in the US filed with VAERS in which someone suspects a link to a Covid vaccine

Times .\nOne would expect the Left to lead the charge in a consumer protection crusade against a new and still experimental pharmaceutical product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nInstead , the Left is leading the charge against those who decline to consume .\nSo what happened ?\nHow did the Left get subverted into being the first-string enforcers for Big Pharma and dystopian government ?\nOne reason appears to be deliberate targeting of the Left with pseudo-collectivist messaging designed to resonate with Left sensibilities .\nMy own clarity on this point was handed to me by fellow author W. Aaron Vandiver , a Colorado attorney and wildlife conservationist .\nAaron left this insightful comment on my previous essay : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus seems to almost have been designed to appeal to the left-wing sense of empathy that green groups and other activists specialize in .\n\u2018 My mask protects you , your mask protects me .\nMy shot protects you , your shot protects me.\n\u2019 This collectivist approach has been alluring to the left , as it appears on the surface to offer a chance to undermine the excessive individualism and greed they have always railed against .\nUnfortunately they have failed to realize that this pseudo-empathetic approach actually empowers the greedy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against , and grants the \u2018 evil greedy corporations \u2019 previously unfathomable authority over everyday life.\n\u201d To whatever extent there were major players on national and global stages who , from the outset , wanted to steer Covid response in a \u201c vaccine only \u201d direction up to and including mandates , passports and permanent digital ID cards , then clearly the first task is to disarm the Left so it can \u2019 t perform its traditional social function of resisting such illiberal developments .\nSkewing the messaging to not merely disarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left on board as an ardent proselyte in a Stockholm syndrome manner is nothing short of brilliant .\nHad the message been : \u201c Get vaccinated so you have a better chance of surviving Covid , \u201d that self-serving proposition would not have prevented the Left from looking critically at these investigational injections , or the lack of public data on them , or the futility of a vaccine-only approach with a non-sterilizing vaccine and a zoonotic virus , or the devastating public health impact of lockdowns , or the Orwellian significance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system .\nBy strategically framing the campaign in pseudo-empathetic , pseudo-collectivist language (

Immune System A paper1 posted May 6 , 2021 , on the preprint server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c reprograms both adaptive and innate immune responses , \u201d causing immune depletion .\nWhile they confirmed the jab \u201c induced effective humoral and cellular immunity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants , \u201d the shot \u201c also modulated the production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells upon stimulation with both specific ( SARS-CoV-2 ) and nonspecific ( viral , fungal and bacterial ) stimuli.\n\u201d In other words , we \u2019 re looking at a horrible tradeoff .\nYou may get some protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants , but you \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens the door wide to all sorts of other health problems , from bacterial , fungal and viral infections to cancer and autoimmunity .\nAfter the injection , innate immune cells had a markedly decreased response to toll-like receptors 4 , 7 and 8 ( TLR4 , TLR7 , TLR8 ) ligands , while cytokine responses induced by fungi were stronger .\nAccording to the authors , defects in TLR7 have previously been linked to an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 in young males .\nPeople who were \u201c fully vaccinated , \u201d having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also produced significantly less interferon upon stimulation , and this can hamper the initial innate immune response against the virus .\nRepeated Vaccinations and the Risk of Autoimmunity Pathogenic infections and cancer are but two potential outcomes of this kind of reprogramming .\nPrevious research , for example , has linked defects in the immune system to a higher risk of autoimmune diseases .\nWhat \u2019 s more , it \u2019 s been shown that antigens in vaccines , specifically , can induce this kind of immune system dysfunction.2 As reported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 , when a study4 in the Journal of Clinical Investigations reported that \u201c SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce broad CD4+ T cell responses that recognize SARS-CoV-2 variants and HCoV-NL63.\n\u201d HCoV-NL63 is a human coronavirus associated with the common cold .\nWhat they did not address was that excessive CD4a+ T cell responses could also result in the development of autoantibodies and autoimmune disease .\nCOVID Shots May Also Cause More Hazardous Variants We \u2019 ve long known that leaky or nonsterilizing vaccines can trigger the evolution of more hazardous viruses.5,6,7,8 So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous versions , which is fortunate , but the risk of the COVID shots creating a \u201c monster \u201d still remains .\nIn a February 9 , 2021 , article,9 NPR highlighted this risk , stating that \u201c vaccines could drive the evolution of more COVID-19 mutants.\n\u201d According to NPR science correspondent Richard Harris , \u201c the virus is always mutating .\nAnd if one happens to produce a mutation that makes it less vulnerable to the vaccine , that virus could simply multiply in a vaccinated individual.\n\u201d The Omicron variant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by the original COVID shots , which is why Omicron infection is being primarily reported in those who have received the injections .\nIn 2018 , Quanta Magazine detailed how vaccines drive the evolution of pathogens.10 I \u2019 ve referenced that article on previous occasions , as have many others .\nIn response , the editor of Quanta Magazine added a \u201c disclaimer \u201d dated December 6 , 2021 , to the article , stating : That statement is clearly false , as studies have repeatedly shown the COVID shots are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly reduce \u201d viral replication or transmission , as the editor claims .\nQuite the opposite .\nPeople who have received one or more COVID shots have been found to harbor higher viral loads than the unvaccinated , and Israel ( which appears to have the best tracking and monitoring ) reports that the worst COVID cases are in those who are fully vaxxed .\nDecember 6 , 2021 , Newsweek11 reported a COVID outbreak among \u201c fully vaccinated \u201d hospital staff in Spain .\nAfter a Christmas dinner with more than 170 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly 70 of them tested positive for COVID .\nSome reported mild symptoms .\nDaniel Horowitz pointed out the editor \u2019 s false note in a December 9 , 2021 , Blaze post:12 A study in the New England Journal of Medicine , published December 9 , 2021 , also confirms that whatever protection you get from the Pfizer COVID shot is short in duration .\nAs explained by the authors:13 \u201c In December 2020 , Israel began a mass vaccination campaign against coronavirus disease 2019 ( Covid-19 ) by administering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp curtailing of the outbreak .\nAfter a period with almost no cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection , a resurgent Covid-19 outbreak began in mid-June 2021 .\nPossible reasons for the resurgence were reduced vaccine effectiveness against the delta ( B.1.617.2 ) variant and waning immunity .\nWe used data on confirmed infection and severe disease collected from an Israeli national database for the period of July 11 to 31 , 2021 , for all Israeli residents who had been fully vaccinated before June 2021 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare rates of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe Covid-19 among persons vaccinated during different time periods , with stratification according to age group and with adjustment for possible confounding factors .\nAmong persons 60 years of age or older , the rate of infection in the July 11-31 period was higher among persons who became fully vaccinated in January 2021 ( when they were first eligible ) than among those fully vaccinated 2 months later , in March ( rate ratio , 1.6 \u2026 ) Among persons 40 to 59 years of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those fully vaccinated in February ( when they were first eligible ) , as compared with 2 months later , in April , was 1.7 \u2026 Among persons 16 to 39 years of age , the rate ratio for infection among those fully vaccinated in March ( when they were first eligible ) , as compared with 2 months later , in May , was 1.6 \u2026 The rate ratio for severe disease among persons fully vaccinated in the month when they were first eligible , as compared with those fully vaccinated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 years of age or older and 2.2 \u2026 among those 40 to 59 years of age \u2026 These findings indicate that immunity against the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 waned in all age groups a few months after receipt of the second dose of vaccine.\n\u201d Earlier this year , vaccine makers and health authorities said the shots were about 95 % effective and if enough people got the shots , normalcy would be restored .\nWe now know that was a false promise .\nThe goal post was moved back with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which we \u2019 re now told we need a third booster .\nDecember 13 , 2021 , Reuters14 reported that British scientists have concluded \u201c two-dose COVID-19 vaccine regimens do not induce enough neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron coronavirus variant , \u201d and that \u201c increased infections in those previously infected or vaccinated may be likely.\n\u201d When in mid-December 2021 , Dr. Anthony Fauci was asked if Americans should expect annual COVID boosters , he replied in the affirmative , saying that Americans will \u201c just have to deal with \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals.15 So , in essence , Fauci wants us to accept that booster deficiency is the reason why the COVID-19 \u201c pandemic \u201d continues .\nClearly , that is not the case .\nThe real reason COVID is still an issue is because Fauci and the medical establishment have suppressed viable early treatments .\nIf early treatment was the norm , COVID would rapidly become a distant memory .\nInstead , the captured U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to novel gene transfer technologies that don \u2019 t work like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t prevent infection and spread , thus creating an evil cycle of new vaccine-resistant variants .\nAs demonstrated by James Lyons-Weiler ( in a now broken weblink ) , the more we vaccinate , the higher the COVID caseload .\nWeiler \u2019 s graph looks very much like that in a September 30 , 2021 , study16 in the European Journal of Epidemiology , which found that the higher the vaccination rate in a given area , the higher the COVID case rate .\nDr. Chris Martenson discusses this finding in the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c the line goes the wrong way , \u201d meaning the more heavily \u201c vaccinated \u201d a population is , the worse things get .\nAs predicted over a year ago , we \u2019 re now on an injection treadmill with no end in sight , and every single dose carries the risk of serious side effects

most conspiratorial events from this past year .\nIt \u2019 s safe to say that 2021 will go down in history as one of the biggest dumpster fires of all time .\nThis year , like in 2020 , was the year that the conspiracy theorists were absolutely vindicated .\nAll of the alleged \u2018 extreme views !\n\u2019 turned out to be true .\nOnce again , they were right all along .\nBefore we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some of the honorable mentions from this past year\u2026 As the official \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 narrative continues to disintegrate , the public began to realize that proven off-label therapeutic drugs like Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were not as evil as the mainstream media , Dr Fauci and Bill Gates had claimed they were .\nThe authoritarians in Australia shocked the world with their COVID Interment Camps in the Northern Territory , and other heavy-handed fascist policies down under .\nAlso , Austria and Germany became Big Pharma \u2019 s Anschluss by returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines and vaccine passports \u2013 effectively locking the unvaccinated in their homes .\nThis has also opened up the very important scientific debate between Germ Theory vs Terrain Theory \u2013 a discussion which strikes fear into the minds of Covidian true believers who regard anything which challenges the almighty powers of the virus as the work of Apostasies to their church .\nThere was also the GameStop short squeeze , Facebook \u2019 s fake whistleblower , and the George Floyd bookend : the Trial of Derek Chauvin \u2013 to name only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the top drawer for 2021\u2026 10 .\nJan 6th \u2018 Insurrection !\n\u2019 \u2013 Never have we seen such a hurricane emerge from such a meager tea cup .\n\u201c The barbarian hordes breached the temple of Democracy !\n\u2019 shrieked Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi , after scenes of angry Trump supporters questioning the 2020 election results became the crisis of the day .\nEnter the infamous Capitol Riots .\nAfter the MAGA supporters and Buffalo Man/QAnon Shaman ( pictured above ) were done taking selfies and doing internet pranks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount a feverish political witch hunt which is still going to this day .\nIn reality , DC police and National Guard were told to stand down that day , and the Capitol Police invited most of the protesters into the building that day .\nIt was almost as if Democrats and Deep State wanted something to happen that day , and then use the political incident to activate a full-blown police state in Washington DC .\nAnd that \u2019 s exactly what happened as 15,000 troops were then deployed to the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up for months \u2013 to protect the politicians from alleged gangs of rogue Trump supporters , bloggers and YouTubers who they claimed might try to mount another errant regime change operation .\nIt would make a good tragic-comedy if it wasn \u2019 t so gushingly over-the-top .\n9 .\nThe Trials of Jussie Smollett and Kyle Rittenhouse \u2013 One was a failed hate crime hoax , and the other was a failed trial by media .\nWhen actor Jussie Smollett tried to stage his own \u2018 hate crime \u2019 in 2019 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook , line and sinker , and proceeded to deride anyone who expressed doubt about his unlikely story .\nEmpire TV star Smollett claimed he was jumped at 2am in a snow storm on his way to Subway Sandwiches in the dead of winter in Chicago by two MAGA hat-wearing Trump supporters who supposedly threw a noose around his neck because he was black and gay .\nIt was a comedy of errors from the word go .\nFast forward two years later when this audacious story was presented to a real jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of it , and Jussie Smollett was found guilty .\nThere was another key political element to this story which might explain why Smollett tried to stage this media stunt when he did \u2013 all of which tracks directly back to the current Vice President Kamala Harris who used the Smollett hoax to promote her proposed \u201c anti-lynching \u201d bill .\nAs it turns out , VP Harris knew Smollett and attended Black Lives Matter linked protests together .\nOf course , no one in the media wants to talk about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there was the Kyle Rittenhouse incident which took place in August 2020 , a shooting that left two dead and one wounded , where the media and the entire Leftwing establishment immediately branded the 17-year-old was a racist and \u201c white supremacist \u201d vigilante who illegally drove across state lines to Kenosha , Wisconsin with an illegally acquired semi-automatic rifle .\nFor the MSM and the Democratic Party , including Joe Biden , it was case closed .\nHowever , when the case finally came to trial in late 2021 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s trial by media , and found that Rittenhouse had acted in self-defense and was thus innocent of all charges .\nIn other words , none of the MSM narrative was true .\nRittenhouse had no connection to any \u2018 white supremacist \u2019 groups either .\nIt was all fake news , intentionally designed to gain political leverage and further polarize America .\nEven after the verdict , both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris refused to recant their previously misleading statements accusing Rittenhouse of a hate crime and branded the trial as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra-politicization means that America is divided into two parallel universes \u2013 one based on reality , and the other as a warped political echo chamber .\n8 .\nThe Collapse of CNN \u2013 It couldn \u2019 t have happened to a nicer network \u2013 the paragon of broadcast journalism ?\nHardly .\nIt \u2019 s been a particularly rough year for \u201c the most trusted name in news.\n\u201d It began will the most rapid ratings drop in cable news history , as viewers fled the network once Trump wasn \u2019 t on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the fall of disgraced New York governor Andrew Cuomo who was implicated in multiple sexual harassment cases in which his younger brother , CNN anchor Chris Cuomo , was caught helping to discredit witnesses behind the scenes .\nAs it turns out , Chris Cuomo was also implicated in a sex-pest case of his own at CNN , forcing the network to fire him .\nBefore that , CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin was caught performing a lewd act of self-love on a company Zoom call .\nIn addition to that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sexual assault case , as well as being caught using his CNN contacts to tamper in the Jussie Smollett case .\nBut that \u2019 s not all .\nThe pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance came in late 2021 when it was revealed that CNN senior producer , John Griffin , 44 , was arrested and charged with luring multiple victims , including multiple underaged females , to take part in illicit sexual activities .\nAccording the UK \u2019 s Daily Mail , according the Justice Department , \u201c Griffin used instant messaging apps last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters , persuading them \u201c to allow him to train their daughters to be sexually submissive.\n\u201d If convicted , the CNN lead producer could face between 10 years and life in prison for each count .\nNo doubt there will be more dirt emerging from this MSM cesspit .\nCNN may be the most damaged brand in media now , which has left some speculating whether the company \u2019 s new owners will be cleaning house , or even changing the name of the international news network .\n7 .\nInflation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year Americans ( and to a lesser degree the UK and Europe ) finally got a taste of failure of Modern Monetary Theory ( MMT ) .\nThey were all happy during COVID when the government was printing trillions in order pay people to stay home and businesses to close their doors , not to mention the government paying for endless COVID vaccines , tests , and mountains of PPE .\nThe naive plebs thought there would be no monetary consequences to the devaluing of their currency , and running the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the virus .\nIn the US , the biggest losers of the Federal Reserve \u2019 s devaluation of the dollar are working-class and middle-class people whose pay cheques simply can not keep pace with the Fed-induced inflation .\nThe media ignored this until it was too late .\nMeanwhile , leftwing progressives are still clinging to the delusion that lower income people will somehow benefit from the continued dollar devaluation \u2013 which is really like a stealth tax on everyone .\nWhile many well-connected businesses and bankers are making fortunes off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a bigger design at play \u2013 the globalists \u2019 scheme to destroy what is left of the fiat money system before introducing their centerpiece of the Great Reset global technocracy \u2013 the Central Bank Digital Currency and total cashless society .\nAlso , did anyone notice how all of the sudden the new buzzword in politics is \u201c The Supply Chain !\n\u201d ?\nEveryone is muttering this previously unspoken basic term in economics and trade .\n\u201c We must fix our broken supply chains !\n\u201d became the well-worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one asks how these supply chains were broken in the first place \u2013 and the answer to that question is simple : anything which is severed or not functioning \u2013 is because of government policy on COVID-19 , lockdowns , \u2018 test and trace \u2019 and the draconian vaccine mandates .\nPure and simple .\nThey broke it , and now they say they want to \u201c Build Back Better.\n\u201d The damage inflicted on economies will last for decades .\nThe only good news is that many people are able to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Invasion !\n\u2013 No yearly list is complete without an officially approved good \u2018 ole Russian conspiracy theory .\nThe theatre of unreality continued , as the intelligence community in Washington claimed to have \u2018 secret information from anonymous sources \u2019 that Russia had amassed \u201c a hundred thousand troops \u201d on the Ukraine border and were planning an imminent invasion of its neighbour in January 2022 .\nThe only problem was none of it was true \u2013 the West had concocted a new phantom invasion conspiracy theory in order to help keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms sales to Europe and Ukraine , and increase the tension geopolitically .\nAs it turns out , Russia was only conducting its usual annual military drills .\nConsequently , Moscow has officially raised the alarm to the international community about NATO \u2019 s plans to militarize the Black Sea .\nBut that hasn \u2019 t stopped the usual suspects and devoted warhawks from continuing to use NATO as a cudgel to goad Ukraine into triggering a full-blown war with Russia , as well as incessant threats of sanctions against Moscow .\nSomeone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will continue pushing until they get one , unless Russia calls their bluff .\nBut the signs are still worrying going into 2022 .\n5 .\nSleepy Joe \u2013 With just one year under his belt as Commander and Chief , Joe Biden , is already being touted as the most shambolic presidency in US history , even surpassing the one term wonder Jimmy Carter .\nIt \u2019 s so bad that Democrats are already searching for someone to replace the gingerly 79 year old Biden before the 2024 election , assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced into early retirement .\nBiden rarely gives any press conferences or genuine interviews , and is often incoherent in public , and appears to be in a terminal state of cognitive decline .\nFor many , he \u2019 s already become a national joke .\nThings have gotten so bad that even CNN is already throwing Biden under the proverbial bus and touting possible replacements in 2024 for the octogenarian president .\nThis also coincides with tanking approval polls for both Biden and VP Kamala Harris .\nWhich begs the question : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nThe answers to that question will eventually come out , but how much damage will be done between now and then ?\n4 .\nSilicon Valley Censorship \u2013 Big Tech is now the corporate manifestation of Orwell \u2019 s Ministry of Truth .\nOnly it \u2019 s not just freedom speech \u2013 it \u2019 s also freedom of reach .\nThe virtue-signalers in Palo Alto and San Francisco claim they are de-platforming accounts in record numbers in order to \u201c protect the public from the virus \u201d and to promote \u2018 public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mask , and lockdown narratives , and more importantly \u2013 protecting manufacturers and government agencies from any criticism from the emerging debacle of vaccine adverse reactions , injuries and deaths .\nFirms like Google/YouTube , Twitter and Facebook are also cynically using the banner of \u201c COVID/medical misinformation \u201d to permanently purge any political dissenters from their platforms .\nIt \u2019 s now clear that these corporation do not respect or believe in concepts like critical thinking , debate and freedom of speech .\nIn reality , their sanitisation operation is meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to protect the State and its corporate partners , and to redefine what will be considered as \u2018 acceptable speech \u2019 in the global commons .\nBy definition , this is fascism writ large .\nBut their facade is cracking , and with every negative vaccine report , these firms , along with the government agencies and NGOs and pharmaceutical firms they are actively colluding with \u2013 will eventually be held accountable , at least in the court of public opinion .\nIt \u2019 s only a question of time .\n3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a cheap 1960 \u2019 s Sci-Fi space horror thriller , only this was in 2021 and has been given top billing by government and the media .\nIt began when some South African epidemiologist announced she has discovered an exotic ( of course , it \u2019 s out of Africa which means it has to be rare , unusual and dangerous ) new coronavirus \u2018 variant \u2019 .\nIt wasn \u2019 t long before the Western media and government found a good brand name for the alleged microscopic particle .\nWorking their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before skipping over \u201c Xi \u201d ( for obvious reasons ) , the OMICRON variant was born .\nBig Pharma needed an Omicron invasion to help sell its boosters shots , but it wasn \u2019 t long before Omicron \u2019 s super powers diminished and the media could no longer prop-up this pseudo science tale .\nThe variants have also served as a great distraction from the growing number of vaccine injuries .\nAs a result , Omicron may well have marked the death knell of the \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 narrative .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse though , and who knows what further damage will be incurred as a result of this endless mythology being conjured by the globalists .\n2 .\nEndless Boosters for an Endless Pandemic \u2013 The heavily marketed \u2018 variants \u2019 were not only designed to keep Great Reset-style \u2018 New Normal \u2019 restrictions in place , but also to keep the experimental mRNA vaccines sales flowing for the transnational drug cartels .\nWith the world facing a seemingly endless stream of coronavirus variants , manufacturers have become more aggressive in pushing the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First it was one booster , then two .\nNow some countries will be requiring their citizens to inject no less than SIX gene-jabs in order for citizens to participate in society .\nWorse yet , vaccine manufactures enjoy total protection from liability so long as governments allow them to hide behind the deceptive shield of \u201c Emergency Use Authorization.\n\u201d It is a scandal of epic proportions .\nMeanwhile , Big Pharma shareholders are over the moon at the prospect of government mandated automatic sales of their experimental injections , with scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the \u2018 global pandemic.\n\u2019 When will it end ?\n1 .\nVaccine Passport \u2013 What was callously dismissed out-of-hand as an \u2018 extreme conspiracy theory \u2019 back in 2020 , has now become an Orwellian reality : a state-sponsored medical apartheid regime , enforced by the insidious invention of Vaccine Passports .\nBy now , most intelligent people have copped-on to the fact that the global rollout of Vaccine ( aka \u2018 Health Pass \u2019 or \u2018 Green Pass \u2019 ) Passports has nothing to do with your health and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social control .\nVaccines themselves were only a means to corral the population into a Vaccine Passport trap and its global digital ID and cashless dystopian control grid .\nIn this way , the \u2018 global pandemic \u2019 project led by the Central Banking cartel , World Economic Forum , Bill Gates Foundation and the Transnational Pharmaceutical cartel \u2013 was just a trojan horse designed to create a completely new type of controlled and surveilled society : a cold and calculating technocracy where the freedoms we enjoy today will become a distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d \u2019 etat , with local henchmen like Boris Johnson , Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron as mere puppets whose job is the dupe their electorates into this terminal technocracy .\nThese globalist oligarchs want nothing less than to establish total command and control for the next 100 years .\nIs it too late for this elite plan to be stopped in its tracks ?\nWhat a wild year .\nExpect more of the same in 2022 .\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR WINTER FUNDRAISING DRIVE HERE", "author": "NEWS WIRE", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2021/12/31/year-in-review-2021-top-ten-real-conspiracies/",
