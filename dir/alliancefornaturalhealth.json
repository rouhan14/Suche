framework that had governed homeopathy for decades .\nThe central question of the case is this .\nFor decades , Compliance Policy Guide ( CPG ) 400.400 governed the homeopathic industry .\nDuring that time , the industry grew substantially , and companies like MediNatura made significant investments to expand product lines and upgrade manufacturing facilities , while also incurring other costs to market their products in compliance with CPG 400.400 .\nThen in 2017 , the FDA issued a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework that had been in place for 30 years .\nThe homeopathic industry had operated under a set of rules , and then the FDA pulled the rug out from under them .\nThe court ruled that the action of the FDA to throw out CPG 400.400 is subject to judicial review to determine if it is in compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act , denying the FDA \u2019 s argument that the move was within the agency \u2019 s discretion .\nWe will monitor the developments of this case , but we @ @ @ @ @ @

and then injected into the patient .\nThe new COVID vaccines , including Johnson & @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Pfizer \u2019 s , use a new method .\nThese vaccines work by tricking our cells into making the necessary proteins to fight off the virus .\nThis is done by delivering genetic information into cells with the instructions for making the right proteins .\nWhile the Moderna , Pfizer , and Johnson & Johnson vaccines work the same way broadly , there are differences .\nIn J & J \u2019 s vaccine , an adenovirus has been genetically engineered to carry the genetic code ( in the form of double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; once the virus enters cells , that code is used to make spike proteins .\nIn the mRNA vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer , the genetic information ( in the form of RNA ) for the spike protein is carried by lipid particles in the form of RNA directly into cells .\nRNA is less stable than DNA , which is why the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines need to be stored at colder temperatures than

above 4 for approximately 24 hours , compromising this natural defense mechanism .\nPPIs may also lead to delayed gastric emptying , increased gastric contents , larger bacterial loads , and increased

!\nFollowing reports of serious blood clotting events after vaccination with the Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine , health authorities have recommended pausing distribution of that vaccine .\nWe \u2019

of blood clots are not at increased risk of this rare reaction , but much still remains unknown about who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer those who are \u201c clotters , \u201d but as we \u2019 ve been saying for some time , you are prevented by federal law from learning about these benefits .\nThe reaction has been dubbed \u201c vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia \u201d ( VIPIT ) .\nIt is characterized by blood clots and low platelet counts occurring 5-28 days after vaccination .\nThe current theory is that VIPIT is the result of an aberrant immune response to the adenovirus that is part of the J & J and AstraZeneca vaccines ( the Pfizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this immune response accounts for the clotting and low platelet counts .\nResearchers believe this is similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) , where the drug heparin\u2014a blood thinner\u2014triggers an immune response and drop in platelet count .\nIn HIT , antibodies form in reaction to heparin binding with platelet factor 4 ( PF4 ) protein , setting off further inappropriate platelet activation resulting in clots and decreased platelet counts .\nMany of those affected by VIPIT have tested positive for the PF4 antibodies , even though heparin is absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bind to PF4 via the adenovirus in the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines .\nAdding to the mystery of these reactions is that , according to some reports , these deadly clots can also occur without the vaccines .\nThese events are rare\u2014though we know generally that vaccine adverse events are underreported .\nBritish health officials estimate the risk of VIPIT to be 4 per million recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine ; in the US , 7 million people have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine , with six reported cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement saying that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks .\nDenmark , however , just decided to cease administering the AstraZeneca shot .\nWe don \u2019 t know yet which patients are more likely to develop VIPIT .\nMost cases in Europe , and all of the six cases in the US , have been in women under the age of 55 , but that may be because most of the AstraZeneca shots were initially given to that population in Europe .\nBecause it is immune-mediated , the current thinking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events are not at increased risk because the clots associated with VIPIT develop through a different mechanism ( described above ) than other clots .\nBlood clotting is an important and normal function of the body , but inappropriate clotting can be very dangerous .\nThere are a multitude of factors and conditions associated with blood clots , including obesity , heart attack , family history , smoking , and long periods of inactivity ( such as after surgery or a long flight ) .\nFor example , those with heart disease can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deposit ruptures , a clot can form that blocks blood flow , causing serious medical issues .\nMore than eight million Americans take a blood thinning medication to prevent blood clots , heart attacks , and strokes .\nThese drugs include anticoagulants like warfarin and heparin and antiplatelet drugs like aspirin .\nWe \u2019 ve written before about how dangerous these drugs can be .\nFor example , in 2016 blood thinners caused more emergency room visits than any other class of drug .\nA 2019 study found that those taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing severe and potentially fatal internal bleeding .\nEven in healthy older people , research has shown that daily baby aspirin has no benefit .\nWe should note that warfarin has an advantage over some of the more dangerous drugs like Pradaxa and Xarelto : as ANH Board member Ron Hoffman , MD points out , hemorrhages in patients taking warfarin can quickly be reversed with an injection of vitamin K. No such antidote exists for Pradaxa and some of the other anticoagulants .\nThere are natural alternatives to help control blood clots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult an integrative physician to determine the best regimen .\nNattokinase , an enzyme made from fermented soy , has been shown to dissolve blood clots and help with cardiovascular disease .\nOther natural health experts recommend omega-3 fatty acids , vitamin E , bioflavanoids ( such as gingko ) , and natural clotting modulators like garlic .\nVitamin K is important for proper blood clotting .\nNote that there are two types of vitamin K , K1 and K2 .\nK1 is found in leafy green vegetables and is the crucial form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fermented foods .\nMany supplements on the market contain only K2 , which alone does not deliver the benefits for healthy clotting .\nThose on anticoagulants should exercise caution supplementing with vitamin K and consult with an integrative physician for proper treatment .\nSince doctors believe that VIPIT is the product of an aberrant immune response rather than a previous history of clotting problems , we don \u2019 t have evidence that the above-mentioned natural medicines will help avoid VIPIT\u2014though it is a good idea generally to support healthy clotting in consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government ensures that patients can \u2019 t easily learn about the benefits of natural medicines , since only FDA-approved drugs can claim to prevent , treat , or mitigate a disease .\nThat \u2019 s why we \u2019 re fighting for legislation that allows supplements to cite credible scientific research about their benefits .\nThis will allow us to take control of our own health and reduce our reliance on expensive and dangerous drugs .\nWill you stand with us ?\nAction Alert

conclusion ?\n\u201c Currently , data are insufficient to support a recommendation for or against the use of vitamin D supplementation to prevent or treat COVID-19.\n\u201d This theme is repeated throughout the document .\nOn one hand , the NIH writes that \u201c studies have not thoroughly assessed use of [ Andrographis for COVID-19 ] , \u201d and then goes on to list a number of studies , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the herb in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms .\nNIH states that there isn \u2019 t enough data to recommend vitamin C , but notes \u201c many researchers recommend studying vitamin C as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 , including its possible ability to reduce inflammation and vascular injury in these patients.\n\u201d Clinicaltrials.gov lists 64 clinical trials on vitamin C and COVID , and 6 trials on intravenous vitamin C.

prevent , or mitigate a disease .\nThe FDA and the FTC , as we \u2019 ve seen , are ready and willing to make sure that no one dares to claim that affordable , safe , and natural substances can help

dollars .\nDrug companies can afford them because drugs are patentable ; most supplements , being natural , can not be strongly patented , so the cost of conducting these trials can not be recouped by supplement companies .\nThen the establishment claims that the absence of clinical trials on vitamins means we don \u2019 t really know whether they work .\nWhen trials are conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dosage being studied is far too low to have therapeutic effects\u2014typically because they are using government references to determine the amount to use .\nFor example , we were told by experts that a clinical trial assessing intravenous vitamin C \u2019 s ability to treat COVID-19 used a dose unlikely to achieve an effect .\nThis is a shame , since skeptics then use the negative results from improperly-designed trials as ammunition to argue that natural medicines don \u2019 t work .\nAs we have long noted , RTCs don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well .\nA drug molecule can be better isolated in its effects .\nFoods and supplements are just part of our diet and often depend on co-factors .\nFor example , supplemental calcium should not be taken without supplemental K2 , but isolating it for

.\nUnder the Clean Air Act ( CAA ) , the EPA has various authorities to regulate emissions from CAFOs .\nFor example , under the CAA the EPA sets standards for six common pollutants , including particulate matter , sulfur dioxide , and nitrogen dioxide\u2014all emitted by CAFOs .\nStates are then responsible for coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality standards , often achieved through a permitting system set up under amendments to the CAA in 1990 .\nPermits are issued when new facilities are built or modified ; other \u201c major sources \u201d of pollution must obtain operations permits which clarify what a facility must do to control emissions .\nOther federal laws require polluters that meet certain thresholds to report discharges of hazardous substances .\nYet the EPA has rarely taken any enforcement actions against CAFOs for air pollution .\nSome reports argue that many CAFOs do not meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions and permits , but admit that the largest CAFOs may indeed exceed CAA thresholds for certain pollutants .\nOther federal actions have specifically exempted CAFOs from reporting air emissions .\nThe problem , however , is that the EPA simply doesn \u2019 t know how much pollution is generated by CAFOs\u2014or how many CAFOs there are , where they are , and how many animals they contain .\nEnter the Air Compliance Agreement .\nIn 2002 , representatives of Big Ag approached the EPA with a proposal .\nThey would let EPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their CAFOs , with the goal of ultimately publishing emissions-estimating methodologies , in return for \u201c safe harbor \u201d \u2014that is , a covenant with the EPA not to sue or hold CAFOs accountable for failing to comply with provisions of the CAA or other federal air pollution laws .\nAlmost two decades later , the EPA has not finished this analysis , and CAFOs remain immune from federal air pollution laws .\nNote too that CAFOs also pollute waterways and drinking water , often with very little transparency .\nClean Water Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollutants into waterways without a permit apply to only the largest CAFOs , just 10 percent of animal confinement operations in the US .\nIt can be difficult to fathom what it \u2019 s like to live near a CAFO .\nPeople describe the nausea that comes simply from being outside , that they can \u2019 t open their windows lest the unbearable stenches from the CAFO invade their home .\nThese noxious odors come from the waste of thousands of animals that is collected in \u201c lagoons.\n\u201d Residents report increases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bronchitis , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease seem to develop in many people living near CAFOs\u2014in addition to the health effects from chronic exposure to CAFO pollutants noted by the study authors : heart disease , stroke , and cancer .\nLives are on the line .\nFor too long CAFOs have not been held accountable for the damage they cause to communities .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to Congress and the EPA , telling them it \u2019 s time to hold CAFOs accountable for the pollution they cause to our air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately .", "author": "ANH-USA", "url": "https://anh-usa.org/cafos-kill-17000-a-year/", "published":

more complicated by patients with ongoing drug treatment ; the CDC says that patients on these medications can receive the vaccine , and decisions to delay drug treatment to receive the vaccine should consider the risks related to the patient \u2019 s underlying condition .\nPart of the reason we don \u2019 t know even more about the vaccine \u2019 s effectiveness is that special populations of patients ( autoimmune patients , organ transplant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on immunosuppressive therapy ) were underrepresented or entirely excluded from COVID vaccine trials .\nThis deepens the conundrum for

approved the first new Alzheimer \u2019 s drug in years\u2014a drug which will reportedly cost more than $ 56,000 per year .\nThe FDA \u2019 s treatment of this drug\u2014which is incredibly expensive and comes with real dangers\u2014is in stark contrast to the skepticism and attacks that characterize the federal government \u2019 s treatment of supplements .\nThe approval of the new Alzheimer \u2019 s drug , which will be sold under the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is due mostly to the fact that an FDA expert advisory committee overwhelmingly voted last November that the evidence supporting the drug \u2019 s efficacy was inadequate .\nOne of the main reasons was that , of the two clinical trials on the drug , only one showed positive results , and those only emerged from an analysis of additional data after the trials were stopped because the drug didn \u2019 t appear to be working .\nThree members of the advisory committee have in fact resigned in protest over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug .\nThe committee \u2019 s stance contrasted with optimism from FDA officials , who said that the \u201c evidence supporting [ the drug \u2019 s ] approval appears strong.\n\u201d Dr. Scott Emerson , another committee member and a professor emeritus of biostatistics at the University of Washington , said he was \u201c very disturbed \u201d that the FDA seemed to be \u201c starting out with the assumption that the treatment works , \u201d adding that the agency position seemed \u201c weighted \u201d toward the drug company .\nWhat a surprise !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 56,000 a year .\nThe Institute for Clinical and Economic Review , a nonprofit that independently evaluates the relationship between a drug \u2019 s price and how well it improves patients \u2019 lives , said the drug should cost $ 8,300 a year given the insufficient evidence supporting its benefits .\nNote too that the real cost to patients will likely be more , since patients on the drug will need regular brain scans to detect bleeding or swelling in the brain , both of which are side effects of this drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this drug .\nOne analysis estimated that if just one-third of eligible patients are prescribed the drug , it will cost Medicare $ 112 billion a year , far more than Medicare spends on any other medication .\nCompare the FDA \u2019 s treatment of this drug to its treatment of supplements .\nOn one hand , we recently reported on a government review listing hundreds of studies showing the plausibility of using supplements like vitamin D and others to fight COVID\u2014yet despite all this data , the conclusion is they can \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other for these supplements .\nOn the other hand , we have inconsistent data on the effectiveness of a drug , with an expert committee recommending against approval\u2014and the FDA approves it anyway .\nIt \u2019 s episodes like this that demonstrate very clearly who the FDA works for .\nThere are natural ways of addressing dementia and Alzheimer \u2019 s .\nWe \u2019 ve written before about the work of Dr. Dale Bredesen who is pioneering this field .\nDr. Bredesen thinks there are three forms of Alzheimer \u2019 s with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease .\nIndividualized protocols must be developed to address these factors .\nDr. Bredesen uses an analogy of a leaky roof with 36 holes to illustrate his approach , where the size of the different holes depends on genetics and environment .\nEach \u201c hole \u201d will be a different size in each person , meaning some may not need to be addressed while others do .\nBut plugging just one of the holes will not stop the rain from getting in\u2014this is why Big Pharma \u2019 s approach fails .\nOne drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Alzheimer \u2019 s , but the rest of the \u201c holes \u201d remain .\nDr. Bredesen identifies three types of Alzheimer \u2019 s .\nOne type is caused by inflammation ; another is caused by a lack of hormones and nutrients necessary to maintain brain plasticity ; another type is caused by exposure to stress and environmental toxins , like mercury or mycotoxins from mold .\nWe \u2019 re also seeing research suggesting that Alzheimer \u2019 s can be understood as Type 3 diabetes to reflect the fact that Alzheimer \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves the brain and has features that overlap with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes .\nAging is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer \u2019 s , but emerging data suggest that type 2 diabetes is another significant risk factor .\nGetting blood sugar under control , then , is potentially an important way to prevent Alzheimer \u2019 s .\nThere is also potential for humble coconut oil to help reverse Alzheimer \u2019 s .\nUntil we embrace the ability of natural medicine to regenerate health , we will keep seeing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockbuster \u201d drugs that are expensive , dangerous , and don \u2019 t work for large swaths of patients .\nMedicine and health can and

at ANH International released a white paper detailing how autoimmune patients are at an increased risk of serious adverse events from COVID vaccination .\nAs such , autoimmune patients have a legitimate medical reason to seriously consider not receiving the COVID vaccine , despite strong societal pressure to do so in order to fully participate in the re-opening of the country .\nPart of the reason for this caution is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t know , as these vaccines were developed and authorized under an accelerated timeframe .\nThis lack of data makes informed decisions about risk and benefit difficult , if not impossible , for many patients , including autoimmune patients .\nThis position is reinforced by a petition submitted to the FDA by a group of highly respected , credentialed experts asking for at least two years of data before the FDA considers granting full approval to COVID vaccines ( current COVID vaccines are currently operating under emergency use authorization , or EUA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urges the FDA to ensure that there is substantial evidence for safety and effectiveness that outweighs harms in special populations such as infants , children , adolescents , the immunocompromised , those with cancer , pregnant women , frail older adults , and patients with autoimmune disorders .\nThese patients were excluded from the ongoing phase III trials of COVID vaccines , and the experts point out that \u201c there is reason to believe the effects of the product may differ from the populations enrolled in the trial.\n\u201d Our white paper explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autoimmune disease through the process of molecular mimicry : the modified spike protein of the vaccine shares 26 peptide sequences with the human genome , which can cause a compromised immune system to attack \u201c friendly \u201d cells .\nThis can take months or years to manifest , and we simply need more data and follow-up to know more about these dangers .\nOn the subject of needing more data , others have similarly pointed out that it is incumbent upon health authorities to acknowledge and follow up with large studies regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing related to COVID vaccines , including clusters cases of low platelets ( thrombocytopenia ) ; noninfectious myocarditis , or heart inflammation , especially for those under 30 ; deep-vein thrombosis ; and death .\nCloser scrutiny can bring results that benefit patients safety : the FDA just indicated it will add a warning about the risk of heart inflammation to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for adolescents and young adults .\nYet despite the lack of data , the CDC , while falling short of recommending the vaccine to above-mentioned populations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive \u201d the COVID vaccine .\nThe petition also calls for additional study of the safety of the spike protein , which the COVID vaccines instruct human cells to produce .\nThis is in light of recent evidence of systemic circulation of the lipid nanoparticles we reported on recently .\nThese nanoparticles carry the instructions for cells to make the spike protein of the COVID virus .\nThere is evidence that the spike protein on its own can damage endothelial cells ( the cells that line blood vessels ) .\nThere may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vaccine-induced spike proteins behave in the body , but to dismiss the concern without further evidence would be irresponsible .\nThese and many other questions must be answered before the FDA even considers granting full approval to COVID vaccines , which Pfizer and Moderna have already applied for .\nThere seems to be a consensus that , while it is an open question as to whether the government or businesses can mandate COVID vaccines while they operate under EUA , full approval from the FDA could spur more businesses , schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe \u2019 ve already seen a number of universities say that they will require the shots for students only after they receive full approval .\nMandates usually come with exemptions for religious or medical reasons .\nBut medical exemptions are notoriously narrow .\nAccording to the CDC \u2019 s guidelines , they are mostly limited to having a serious allergic reaction to a previous vaccine .\nIt is unlikely that autoimmune patients would qualify for exemptions should mandates go into effect .\nWe don \u2019 t need mandates , though , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have medical concerns about receiving the COVID vaccine .\nWe \u2019 ve mentioned the example of Israel , where the government issues \u201c green passes \u201d allowing access to social , cultural , sporting events , gyms , restaurants , etc.\n, to individuals who have either recovered from COVID or have had the vaccine .\nGreen passes must be renewed every six months .\nMore and more we \u2019 re seeing businesses , sports venues , and cruise lines fully open to vaccinated individuals , sometimes excluding the unvaccinated .\nThis places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns .\nPart of ANH \u2019 s core mission and identity are the principles of bodily autonomy and freedom of choice .\nThere are not mandates for the COVID vaccine that eliminate choice .\nChoice in this instance for autoimmune patients is being more subtly undermined by a society that is increasingly conferring more privileges to the vaccinated than the unvaccinated .\nThat isn \u2019 t right , particularly when safety and efficacy data for patient populations like the autoimmune are incomplete , and what data there is points to increased danger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-science to ask for more data on vaccines that were approved on an abbreviated timeline , particularly when there are danger signals for certain populations of patients .\nMore data gives us a more complete profile of their safety and efficacy , which allows true informed consent\u2014a basic tenet of medical ethics .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to the FDA , telling them you support the petition calling for more data

"Help us build support in Congress to ensure you can access the customized medicines you rely on .\nAction Alert !\nAs part of its effort to implement the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 , the FDA is poised to implement a bad policy that will limit the amount of medicines like bioidentical hormones such as estriol that compounding pharmacies can send out of state , even when patients have a

the responsibility for overseeing pharmacies within their borders that send a certain amount of medicine to other states .\nImportantly , the final MOU does not address a key issue , which is that it

little-known rule could alter your neighborhood and endanger your health .\nThe federal government has ensured that 5G can come to your neighborhood whether you like it or not .\nA recent rule change allows the telecoms industry to turn consenting private residences into cell towers , endangering the health of the neighborhood .\nThe only way to fight back is to talk to neighbors who may be considering adding an antenna to their house to inform them of the facts that industry is conveniently leaving out .\nOur previous coverage provides more background on the OTARD rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air reception device.\n\u201d Originally , the rule prohibited local municipalities from restricting the installation of satellite dish antennas and other antennas on private residences for reception of TV signals ; it didn \u2019 t apply to devices that also transmit signals .\nThe FCC recently implemented changes to the rule that allows industry to install wireless transmitting antennas on private homes ; and since this would be done on private property , it circumvents the need for companies to meet local zoning and environmental requirements .\nThere is also no requirement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule has thus been changed from a pro-consumer rule to a pro-industry rule .\nTelecom companies are now reportedly going around neighborhoods with deceptive offers like : \u201c Earn $ 600 \u2013 Get paid for doing nothing while helping your community .\nBe the first person to provide Internet of Things coverage in your neighborhood.\n\u201d For some , this may be a tempting offer .\nIndustry may even offer benefits like free internet\u2026but they may also charge you for the electricity used by the antenna .\nWe just don \u2019 t know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies are not telling property owners that they could be held liable if their neighbors experience negative health effects due to the radiation coming from these antennas .\nWhile the telecoms industry has insisted for decades that cell phones , and now 5G networks , are completely safe , there are mountains of evidence to suggest otherwise .\nWe \u2019 ve covered a lot of this evidence in previous articles linking EMF radiation to altered metabolism , cancer , cardiovascular disease , DNA damage , impaired sperm function , cognitive impairment , neurological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFor these reasons , insurers rank 5G EMF radiation as \u201c high risk , \u201d and due to these risks , most insurance plans include an \u201c electromagnetic field exclusion \u201d \u2014that is , insurance plans do not cover injuries related to wireless radiation .\nTelecoms can not offer homeowners insurance against liability from the antenna causing physical harm to others because this insurance doesn \u2019 t exist .\nUnless immediate action is taken , we will be exposed to radiation generated by wireless devices on an unprecedented scale .\nEspecially concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled out use short millimeter waves , which can not travel as far as longer waves .\nThis means that more \u201c small cell \u201d towers are needed to create a network , which is why the telecoms industry needs to turn private homes into cell towers .\nSome neighborhoods would see dozens of small cells installed , all of them emitting microwave radiation .\nThese towers will also emit the lower 4G frequencies , since 5G rollout is still ongoing .\nThere are particular dangers with 5G networks .\nWe \u2019 ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sweat ducts act as antennas for millimeter waves , meaning we would absorb more of this energy into our bodies .\nMillimeter wavelengths are also used in crowd control systems , making people caught in the high-powered millimeter wave feel like their skin is on fire .\nNo independent research has confirmed the safety of 5G networks .\nThe US government \u2019 s own National Toxicology Program released the results of a $ 30 million , ten-year project looking into the link between cell phones and cancer .\nIt concluded that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to high levels of radiofrequency radiation ( RFR ) like that used in 2G and 3G cell phones developed cancerous heart tumors.\n\u201d Again , 5G networks dramatically increase these exposures due to the increased number of \u201c small cells \u201d which will blanket neighborhoods with EMF radiation .\nAn additional issue is that it \u2019 s nearly impossible to effectively sue the wireless companies themselves .\nA close look at city and municipal contracts shows that it isn \u2019 t Verizon , for example , doing business , but a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do business in a particular location .\nThis insulates Verizon from being liable for huge amounts in damages .\nIf a lawsuit is successful , you \u2019 re raiding the coffers of a \u201c Verizon New York , Inc. \u201d or a smaller company \u201c doing business as \u201d Verizon .\nANH is , however , joining Safe Technology Minnesota in submitting an amicus brief in support of Children \u2019 s Health Defense \u2019 s lawsuit challenging the FCC for adopting the OTARD rule changes .\nA better strategy is to engage with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asking questions : are they aware that insurance against health effects from EMF radiation doesn \u2019 t exist ?\nIf a neighbor , or neighbors \u2019 children , get sick from the radiation emanating from the antenna on their house , can they afford a legal defense ?\nAre they aware of the myriad health dangers associated with EMF radiation ?\nAre they on the hook for the electricity taken up by the antenna ?\nPerhaps proactive action to discuss the issue with neighbors before the industry makes the offer can inoculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frank conversations about this issue may be the only way to prevent your neighborhood from being

like increasing the cap on compensations and extending the statute of limitations on injuries from three to five years , among other things we will detail below .\nBut there is no escaping that VICP is a fundamentally broken system that leaves many vaccine-injured families in the lurch .\nWe must push for more robust reforms to VICP so real justice can be served to families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congress in 1986 to create a no-fault compensation system for children injured by vaccines .\nLawsuits against vaccine makers were dramatically increasing in number after a spate of injuries related to the DTP vaccine .\nVaccine manufacturers wanted to be shielded from liability , and the government wanted to create the infrastructure for a national immunization program .\nVICP accomplished these goals by setting up a separate adjudication process for the vaccine injured .\nRather than hold vaccine manufacturers accountable for the damage caused by their products , those injured by vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , presided over by eight \u201c Special Masters , \u201d experts ( supposedly ) who would work exclusively on vaccine cases .\nSuccessful cases would be compensated from a fund created by a 75-cent tax on all vaccines sold .\nA Vaccine Injury Table was created to help simplify determinations of causation .\nThe Table lists all covered vaccines , as well as the injuries widely recognized as caused by each vaccine , alongside a specific timeframe for each injury \u2019 s onset .\nIf a claimant could show that their injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( an \u201c on-Table \u201d injury ) , compensation would be automatic ; otherwise , claimants would need to litigate through the court .\nPetitioners to the court may receive a maximum of $ 250,000 for a vaccine-related death and $ 250,000 for pain and suffering\u2014amounts that have not changed since 1986 .\nThe law also requires that claims be filed no later than three years after the injury .\nVICP has been plagued with issues from the very beginning .\nAspects of the program meant to increase speed , efficiency , predictability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as detailed by a 2015 analysis .\nOn average , only a quarter of claims are compensated , and not in a timely manner .\nDecisions from Special Masters were supposed to be delivered within 240 days , as stipulated by Congress .\nLess than 5 percent of petitions satisfy this statutory deadline , with most exceeding it by a wide margin\u201439 percent took between two and five years , and 19 percent took five years or more .\nEven if a petition is successful , it can take years for VICP to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the meantime , families struggle to deal with increasing medical bills for their injured children .\nThe new bill seeks to address these abysmal time lags by increasing the number of Special Masters from eight to ten .\nIt also increases the maximum award from $ 250,000 to $ 600,000 for both death and pain and suffering\u2014an improvement , but hardly just compensation .\nIt increases the statute of limitations for filing cases from three to five years ; it also adds adults and pregnant women to the Vaccine Injury Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and requires the table be updated by the CDC within six months when a new vaccine is added , rather than two years .\nThese are welcome improvements but fall far short of making the VICP a just system for the vaccine injured .\nThe Vaccine Injury Table , for example , is in dire need of reform .\nThe 1986 law gave federal health authorities discretionary power to update the table\u2014power which has been used not to expand the list of injuries eligible for compensation , but to restrict it .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal authorities eliminated residual seizure disorder related to DTP vaccines from the table and narrowed the definition of encephalopathy from a broad , inclusive definition to a technical , narrow definition that is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to satisfy .\nNine vaccines have been added to the Table since 1986 , but only one new injury : anaphylaxis within four hours of receiving the Hepatitis B vaccine .\nThese changes have made compensation through VICP even more of an uphill battle : between 1989 and 1992 , more than 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent years , 90 percent of petitions assert non-table injuries requiring extensive , lengthy , often-unsuccessful litigation .\nThe table should be updated more frequently with public participation .\nResidual seizure disorder should be added back to the table , along with a broader definition of encephalopathy .\nThe law should include a presumption that death within 72 hours of receipt of a vaccine may be causally related to vaccination unless an obvious , alternate cause of death exists .\nFurther , the addition of future vaccines to the table should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elucidate vaccine-related adverse events .\nIndependent research is critical : the same federal agency that is responsible for developing , licensing , and promoting the use of vaccines can not be expected to be an impartial investigator of vaccine risks .\nThe National Academies of Science , Engineering , and Medicine ( then known as the Institute of Medicine ) , has acknowledged the lack of data on vaccine-related adverse events : \u201c The lack of adequate data regarding many of the [ vaccine-related ] adverse events under study was of major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that the VICP should adopt a more relaxed standard of proof for petitioners ; currently petitioners must prove that a vaccine \u201c more likely than not \u201d caused an injury .\nAny reasonable doubt should favor petitioners , not the government .\nThe new bill is a decent first step , but further reforms like those outlined above must be implemented to further fix VICP so it can accomplish its mission , stated by Senator Paula Hawkins at the time of the Act \u2019 s passing in 1986 , of dispensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @

attacking it now ?\nAction Alert !\nA few weeks ago , we told you about the FDA \u2019 s recent actions threatening NAC supplements\u2014products which the FDA has allowed on the market for decades .\nThe question is , why now , after all these years , is the FDA doing this ?\nDigging a bit deeper , it seems obvious that the FDA is clearing the market of affordable NAC supplements in an effort to eliminate competition for NAC drugs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few years .\nIf our suspicions are correct , this would be another outrageous example of the FDA doing Big Pharma \u2019 s dirty work .\nWe can not let it happen .\nTo briefly recap how we got here : In a slew of warning letters sent last year , the FDA targeted a number of supplement companies marketing \u201c unapproved \u201d cures for hangovers\u2014which the agency absurdly considers to be a \u201c disease.\n\u201d Some of these products contain NAC .\nIn the letters to those companies , the FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal definition of a supplement because it was approved as a drug in 1963 ; according to federal law , any substance approved as a drug before it was sold as a supplement can not be sold as a supplement .\nAll of this means that the status of NAC as a supplement is currently in dispute .\nSo , why is the FDA threatening NAC now , during a pandemic when a new FDA commissioner hasn \u2019 t even been appointed ?\nFor starters , a drug company is investigating NAC as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that damages the myelin sheath , which insulates nerve cells in the brain .\nThe Phase 1 trial was completed in March 2020 .\nBut that \u2019 s just the beginning .\nA search through the government \u2019 s clinical trials database shows considerable interest from the pharmaceutical industry in NAC .\nThere are 17 trials looking at NAC , in both drug and supplement form , in the treatment of COVID .\nAdditionally , there are over 50 trials looking at NAC for a variety of other conditions , including : autism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol abuse disorder , rhinosinusitis , bronchiolitis , cardiac arrhythmia , and more .\nNote that NAC drugs are currently available in generic form since it is off-patent , but a company could bring a new branded NAC drug to market if it was proven effective for an additional indication .\nGiven these facts , it seems reasonable to assume that the FDA is setting the stage for a new NAC drug to come to market by removing the competition from much cheaper NAC supplements .\nWe called it when the FDA pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they went after brain health supplements , trying to clear the market for a new Alzheimer \u2019 s drug\u2014culminating in the recent approval of an Alzheimer \u2019 s treatment that many experts think is not effective .\nCBD supplements may face a similar fate if Congress does not force the FDA \u2019 s hand by legalizing CBD in dietary supplements .\nIt is critically important to maintain access to affordable NAC supplements .\nIn a recent interview with the Life Extension Foundation , Dr. Daniel Amen noted that NAC \u201c has shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , schizophrenia , OCD , and addictions .\nIt can also decrease inflammation and may help delay brain atrophy in Alzheimer \u2019 s disease.\n\u201d NAC protects the body from toxins , is a selective immune system enhancer , and helps remove free radicals , which contribute to neurogenerative diseases and aging .\nIn Europe , NAC is a prescription medicine used to reduce congestion .\nNAC is also a precursor to glutathione , one of the body \u2019 s most important

"alliancefornaturalhealth", "title": "Time to Give Up Red Meat?", "content": "A new study elaborates the connection between red meat and cancer , but the story is much more complicated than the media lets on .\nThe study , published in the journal Cancer Discovery , found specific patterns of DNA damage caused by diets high in red meat .\nThe study elucidates how a high consumption of red meat damages health , but news coverage of the topic adds to a long list of articles whose takeaway is that we should avoid red meat and focus more on \u201c healthier \u201d proteins like poultry , fish , and even lab-grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe don \u2019 t need to give up eating organic , pasture-raised red meat , as long as it \u2019 s in moderation and accompanied by other healthy foods .\nWe particularly do not need to turn to the plant-based meats that are becoming increasingly popular .\nThe mechanism by which red meat damages DNA is the alkylation of heme iron in unprocessed meats , which produces highly carcinogenic n-nitroso compounds .\nYet these markers were only found in the top centile of red-meat eaters ( those with the top 10 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of about 155 grams , or about 5.5 ounces , of red meat a day ) .\nAs our friends at ANH International point out , we know these very big meat-eaters often don \u2019 t consume a lot of quality plant foods , vegetables , herbs , or supplements that can counteract the DNA damage .\nThe meat is also largely from industrial farming systems ( not pasture-raised ) where animals are stressed and given foods to which they haven \u2019 t adapted ( like genetically modified soy and corn ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters a great deal .\nWe know that pasture-raised beef is healthier than beef that comes from concentrated animal feeding operations ( CAFOs ) .\nGrass-fed beef has nearly seven times more omega-3 than omega-6 fatty acids , so eaten in moderation , it offers healthier levels of essential fats .\nMoreover , grass-fed beef is lower in total fat , and higher in vitamin E complex , beta-carotene , thiamin , riboflavin , calcium , magnesium , and potassium .\nPart of the attack on red meat is that it is bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends .\nPasture-raised cattle can be carbon neutral .\nIn some cases , operations that pasture-raise beef are \u201c carbon sinks \u201d : for every kilogram of beef produced on one farm , 3.5 kilograms of carbon were sequestered in the farm \u2019 s plants and soil .\nCAFOs , on the other hand , are notorious for their greenhouse gas emissions .\nMore and more people seem to be turning to lab-grown meat , but there are significant problems with these products .\nFor starters , many of them contain unhealthy ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not undergone safety testing , carrageenan , artificial coloring , and methylcellulose ; they are also high in omega-6 fatty acids since some of them contain sunflower or canola oil .\nPlant-based meat also contains many soy-derived ingredients .\nThis disrupts the argument that plant-based meat is better for the environment , since they rely on monoculture crops like soy which hurt ecological diversity .\nAgain , as ANH International points out : \u201c [ Monocrops ] destroy soils , they are often dependent on large agrochemical inputs such as glyphosate ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fungicides that wipe out soil microbial life .\nTheir lack of diversity and insecticide inputs kill off natural predators and parasites of pests , maintaining the pesticide spiral.\n\u201d The point is this : the \u201c don \u2019 t eat red meat \u201d narrative we often get from media reports on these kinds of studies are over-generalized to the point of doing the public a disservice .\nAs we \u2019 ve shown above , the type of meat , the amount of meat , and balancing the diet with foods and supplements that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods or supplements that contain carotenoids , vitamins C and E , flavonoids , and polyphenols ) are all part

be preparing to unleash an anti-supplement policy as early as next year that could eliminate tens of thousands of products from the market\u2014in the middle of a pandemic .\nAction Alert !\nRecently , the FDA announced that , by the end of June 2022 , it plans to release drafts or final versions of a number of policies , and among them is the \u201c new dietary ingredient \u201d ( NDI ) guidance ( \u201c new supplement \u201d guidance , in plain English ) .\nIt is no exaggeration to say that this is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in decades .\nWe must continue to vehemently oppose the guidance as currently written and demand that substantial changes are made before the final version is released .\nIt is especially dangerous given that we are in a pandemic situation that is constantly evolving , with scientists warning of viral variants that evade vaccine-induced immunity .\nHere is some brief background .\nUnder the Dietary Health and Supplement Education Act ( DSHEA ) , any dietary supplement introduced to the market in the US after 1994 is considered \u201c new \u201d ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notify the FDA at least seventy-five days in advance of marketing the product .\nIn implementing this policy , however , the FDA has turned a simple notification procedure into a de facto pre-approval process akin to that which is required of pharmaceutical drugs .\nThe FDA \u2019 s policy is nothing less than a massive broadside aimed at crippling the supplement industry .\nHow do we know this ?\nAn economic analysis estimated that the guidance would result in : \u2022 tens of thousands of products disappearing from store shelves ; \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion and $ 165 billion in animal and human product safety studies to comply with the FDA \u2019 s NDI notification protocols ; and \u2022 the loss of between 55,270 and 104,475 jobs in the supplement industry .\nHow does the FDA \u2019 s guidance do this ?\nFirst , the guidance imposes safety requirements on new supplements that are not even expected of drugs !\nThe FDA \u2019 s guidance describes how to determine what kind of safety studies to submit with an NDI notification .\nThe agency states that additional safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of supplements changes .\nFor example , if a history of safe use has been established with adults , but a substance will be used in a dietary supplement marketed for young children , the FDA would require another NDI notification .\nNot even drugs are held to this standard : the FDA states that \u201c most drugs prescribed for children have not been tested in children.\n\u201d Safety studies for supplements may sound reasonable , but just remember : requiring these studies is part of the FDA approval process for drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are patentable .\nSupplements are natural and are not strongly patentable , so if they are also required to conduct pre-market studies , they don \u2019 t have the same ability to recoup those costs .\nThis will either force companies to go out of business or it will make supplements so expensive that they are priced out of the market .\nSupplements also have a consistently sterling record of safety .\nThe FDA is also broadening the group of substances that must submit new supplement notifications by adopting a loose definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be \u201c chemically altered.\n\u201d If a post-DSHEA ingredient has been present in the food supply and has not been chemically altered , it is exempted from submitting an NDI notification .\nThe problem is that the FDA \u2019 s definition of \u201c chemically altered \u201d is so broad that only the most basic manufacturing methods would not \u201c chemically alter \u201d an ingredient .\nThis language will stifle innovations in manufacturing and ignores the fact that new and more effective ways of producing supplements have arisen in the last twenty-two years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with the guidance that interested readers can reference in our previous coverage of this topic .\nIf the FDA sticks to its timeline of June 2022 , the release of the final guidance could seriously hinder our ability to stay healthy , naturally , during this pandemic .\nAnd using supplements to shore up our immune system against COVID is even more important as scientists learn more about the ability of multiple COVID variants to adapt and \u201c escape \u201d the immunity conferred by current vaccines and even natural infection .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune escapes \u2019 could mean more people who have had COVID-19 remain susceptible to reinfection , and that proven vaccines may , at some point , need an update.\n\u201d In light of these concerns , our friends at ANH International have wisely advised that we don \u2019 t rely exclusively on vaccines ; we need a diverse array of tools to protect ourselves , including access to quality supplements .\nWe can \u2019 t use these strategies if the FDA makes sure they \u2019 re out of reach .\nWe must push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and well-being .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to Congress and the FDA to urge drastic changes to the NDI guidance to protect supplement access .\nPlease

health effects of cell phones .\nIn the coming weeks , we will show how the wireless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermine , confuse , and discredit the debate about the safety of cell phones and how these companies game the already lax federal standards for radiofrequency energy absorption .\nWe have all gotten used to the convenience of cell phones and the improvements they \u2019 ve brought to our lives .\nBut would consumers have embraced the technology so fervently had we been told the truth since the beginning about the dangers , without the wireless industry clouding the science and undercutting scientists who sound the alarm ?\nWe could be approaching another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massively profitable industry ignored health concerns for decades to protect their bottom line .\nCompanies

industry has muddied the waters for decades on the science of cell phone safety .\nAre cell phones dangerous for human health ?\nMany scientists knowledgeable about the issues say that they do pose human health risks .\nAsk the telecoms industry and their friends in the federal government , though , and you get a different response : cell phones are perfectly safe and there is no cause for alarm .\nUsing the same playbook as tobacco companies decades earlier , the telecoms industry has , for decades , spent millions to warp the scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who dare to talk about the safety issues .\nCell phone companies have known all along that cell phones can cause cancer and genetic damage , but muddied the waters to protect their bottom line .\nIt is a sordid history , starting as far back as 1993 .\nAt that time , a lawsuit alleged that a cell phone caused a lethal brain tumor .\nThe story went viral , prompting a congressional subcommittee investigation and a drop in cell phone stock .\nThe trade association for the cell phone industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CTIA ) , began a decades-long effort to get the best science money could buy to show that cell phones are completely safe .\nTo spearhead the effort , they hired George Carlo , an epidemiologist who had previously done damage control for other industries .\nWith chemical industry funding , for example , Carlo concluded that low levels of dioxin , the chemical in Agent Orange , were not dangerous .\nSo , it seemed like a good bet that Carlo would also go to bat for the telecoms industry .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carlo headed the Wireless Technology Research project .\nUnfortunately for industry , the studies conducted as part of this well-funded project raised serious questions about cell phone safety\u2014questions which Carlo presented to industry leaders .\nCarlo \u2019 s studies had found that the risk of certain tumors was more than doubled in cell phone users and that the radiation from cell phone antennas could cause functional genetic damage .\nSoon after Carlo presented these findings to the industry bosses , Tom Wheeler , the head of the CTIA , began discrediting Carlo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go on to become a Federal Communications Commission chairman .\nThis would become emblematic of the industry \u2019 s approach to the cell phone safety debate .\nA 1994 internal memo from Motorola referred to \u201c war gaming \u201d the science , where industry would fund studies that would be friendly to the industry and attack those that raise questions .\nIndustry would also work to place friendly scientists on advisory boards like those at the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .\nAnd \u201c war game \u201d they did .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell phone use between 1990 and 2005 and found that 67 percent of independent studies found biological damage from cell phone radiation , but only 28 percent of industry-sponsored studies did .\nThis was confirmed by a separate analysis that concluded industry-funded studies were two and a half times less likely than independent studies to find a biological effect from cell phone radiation .\nWhen the WHO started looking into the health effects of cell phone radiation , the industry did all it could to ensure a favorable outcome .\nIndustry financial contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totaling some $ 4.7 million , paid off when the WHO convened a group of scientists to discuss how to classify the cancer risk posed by cell phones .\nThe cell phone industry secured \u201c observer \u201d status for its trade associations and was able to place two industry-funded scientists on the working group that would debate the classification .\nYou \u2019 ll recall that the WHO did classify cell phone radiation as a \u201c possible carcinogen , \u201d which is not the outcome industry wanted ; but a number of the scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably carcinogen \u201d classification , so industry influence was able to limit the damage .\nThe US government \u2019 s National Toxicology Program invested in a $ 30 million , ten-year project looking into the link between cell phones and cancer .\nIt concluded that \u201c there is clear evidence that male rats exposed to high levels of radio frequency radiation ( RFR ) like that used in 2G and 3G cell phones developed cancerous heart tumors.\n\u201d Yet the industry was able to spin these findings .\nJust consider some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time : \u201c Seriously , stop with the irresponsible reporting on cell phones and cancer , \u201d read a Vox headline .\n\u201c Do Cell Phones Cause Cancer ?\nDon \u2019 t Believe the Hype , \u201d said The Washington Post .\nSo what \u2019 s the big picture ?\nOf the studies done in the last 30 years on the health effects of radio frequency radiation , 75 percent reported significant biological effects ; 87 percent of studies on electromagnetic fields reported significant biological effects .\nThe science tells us that radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , but the industry has been able to evade regulation through crony capitalism .\nThe FCC is a \u201c captured agency \u201d beholden to industry interests .\nThe

previous coverage .\nThere are 60 studies on ivermectin and COVID ; 39 have been peer-reviewed .\nAs our friends at ANH International point out , no other known substance can deliver the 88 %

ivermectin is off-patent , meaning Big Pharma can \u2019 t make billions from it , so the FDA attacks it to clear the market for more expensive alternatives .\nWe believe the FDA did something similar in attacking brain health supplements like vinpocetine and picamilon , clearing the way for new blockbuster Alzheimer \u2019 s drugs that mostly flopped , or more recently have created a firestorm of controversy for gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a viable alternative to treat COVID-19 also throws a wrench in the works of the government \u2019 s COVID vaccine roll-out .\nRecall that all of the current COVID vaccines operate under EUAs , which are granted on the condition that no other viable alternatives exist .\nIf ivermectin is recognized as a viable alternative , the criteria for granting an EUA for a COVID vaccine no longer exist , and the government \u2019 s vaccination campaign falls apart .\nGovernment agencies can \u2019 t seem to agree on ivermectin .\nAfter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance who shared the scientific rationale for using ivermectin against COVID-19 , the National Institutes of Health \u2019 s Treatment Guidelines Panel upgraded their designation for the drug from \u201c against \u201d to \u201c neither for or against , \u201d which is the same recommendation given to monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma , both widely used across the nation .\nAll of this underlines how broken the healthcare system in this country is .\nThe government pushes expensive , often dangerous medicines for COVID ( remember remdesivir , a drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing COVID mortality ? )\nand other illnesses while ignoring low-cost alternatives that either can not be strongly patented or are off-patent .\nBig Pharma and their government cronies want mandatory vaccines , not ivermectin , as the answer to COVID because vaccines will make the most money .\nWhy spend the exorbitant sums on clinical trials for ivermectin and COVID when the patent protection wouldn \u2019 t be as strong , the market exclusivity period is shorter than for new drugs , and the potential pool of patients is substantially smaller than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not , gets the

this fungicide , making the spores resistant .\nThen when triazoles are used in patients with a fungal infection , the drugs don \u2019 t work .\nSo , what \u2019 s the answer ?\nTo control weeds , scientists have been urging farmers to engage in practices that are commonplace in regenerative agriculture : rotating crops , hand-pulling weeds , composting , avoiding artificial and synthetic fertilizers , and shifting from feeding lots to well-managed grazing practices .\nThese practices rebuild soil health , restore plant nutrient density , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a transition obviously requires major changes in how large-scale farming operations are conducted .\nThese practices are labor intensive and account for much of the premium we pay for organic produce .\nBut farmers , in the end , may be forced to \u201c return to their roots , \u201d so to speak , to continue farming as chemical weedkillers become obsolete .\nWe \u2019 ve covered the alternatives to antibiotics for many

of antibiotics driving \u201c superbugs , \u201d or the idea that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID , staying ahead of the mutating virus with ever more booster shots rather than creating health by building immune resilience .\nNatural , regenerative health is about creating a healthy environment in the body through proper nutrition , lifestyle , and supplementation , just as regenerative agriculture is

are endangering the public on cell phone safety .\nAction Alert !\nOne of the only ways that the government regulates cell phones for safety\u2014by limiting the amount of radiation they can emit\u2014is completely broken and inadequate , with children facing the most risk .\nIndustry does its own testing on emissions and can manipulate the test in a variety of ways .\nThe end result is that the amount of radiation the vast majority of Americans are absorbing from cell phones is higher than what industry is reporting .\nOne of the only government standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absorption Rate ( SAR ) , a measurement of the rate at which electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by human tissue .\nThe FCC set the legal SAR limit for cell phones way back in 1991 , and they haven \u2019 t changed since .\nThere are a number of critical problems with current SAR limits .\nFirst , they were designed to prevent radiation from having thermal effects on the body\u2014that is , causing damage by literally heating our bodies like a microwave oven .\nBut we know that radiation at lower levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-thermal health effects , with cancers and fertility problems being the most widely known .\nFurther , the FCC doesn \u2019 t even test phones to ensure that SAR limits are being met ; that job is left to the cell phone industry .\nAnd , surprise , there is evidence of dishonesty .\nIn 2019 , the Chicago Tribune did their own testing of smartphones .\nThey found that the iPhone 7 , for example , not only measured over the legal SAR limit , but more than double what Apple reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe testing used by companies to determine SAR levels are also completely inadequate and systematically underestimates exposure for 97 percent of the population .\nCompanies test their phones on dummies called Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequins ( SAM ) , the proportions of which represent the top 10 % of U.S. military recruits in 1989 .\nThis will underestimate exposure for any head smaller than the SAM model\u2014which is 97 percent of the population .\nThese tests can also be manipulated by increasing the distance between the phone and the head using plastic spacers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an exponential decrease in recorded radiation levels .\nThis is why many the booklets for many cell phones usually contain a page with safety information stating that the phone must not be placed closer than 10 , 15 , or even 25 millimeters to the body .\nUnderestimating radiation exposures in SAR levels poses particular dangers for children .\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics has said that the \u201c differences in bone density and the amount of fluid in a child \u2018 s brain compared to an adult \u2018 s brain could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RF energy deeper into their brains than adults.\n\u201d When local communities try to step up to protect their citizens from harm , the wireless industry swoops in with lawsuits to block common sense safety measures .\nThe City of San Francisco passed an ordinance in 2010 requiring cell phone manufacturers to display more prominently information on the radiation emissions of their devices .\nIndustry sued the city ; fearing a prolonged legal fight , and the city backed down .\nIn 2015 a similar scenario was repeated in Berkeley , California .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past few weeks , we could be on the verge of a public health crisis .\nFor decades studies have pointed to the dangers of cell phone use , but industry and their government cronies have effectively muddied the waters enough to keep the status quo .\nThe one safety standard that applies to cell phones , as we \u2019 ve shown above , is entirely inadequate .\nLawmakers must be made to take notice of these uncomfortable truths and act accordingly .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to Congress and tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strengthened to protect consumers from negative health effects .\nPlease send your message immediately .", "author":

//www.environmentalhealthsymposium.com/blog Smoke from wildfires blanketing the West Coast in the last two years have caused some of the planet \u2019 s worst air quality , with smoke reaching the East Coast and Europe .\nThe EPA PM 2.5 AQI ( Air Quality Index ) in Portland , Eugene OR and Vancouver British Columbia reached over 700 last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local indoor and outdoor air sensors purchased and used by individuals throughout the U.S. and uploaded to a national map in real time .\nThis would make them the most polluted cities in the world for that period .\nAnd as the EPA AQI only goes to 500 , the EPA is clear that recommendations for readings above 500 is to \u201c remain in a room or building with filtered air \u201d .\nThe live PurpleAir map screenshot of Northern California taken at 10:30 am on August 25th 2021 , shows multiple readings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the EPA , for readings between 151-200 : \u201c everyone may experience health effects if exposed for more than 24 hours , members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.\n\u201d When the air quality index rises over 400 the EPA is clear : \u201c Health warnings of emergency conditions if exposed for 24 hours .\nThe entire population is more likely to be affected.\n\u201d An emergency condition includes the following : acute respiratory distress , myocardial infarction and stroke .\nLast year , according to the World AQI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 108 ) has about the same level of polluted air as Beijing ( 122 ) but more polluted than Shanghai ( 88 ) or Wuhan ( 91 ) .\nAnd , on Sept. 9th , 2020 the I-5 corridor in Oregon had air quality index ( AQI ) readings that hit 599 on the EPA \u2019 s map for the state , and approximately 700 in some locations on the crowd-sourced PurpleAir monitoring site .\nAgain , the EPA AQI scale only reaches 500 , so the effects of these high levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NPR analysis of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency air quality data found that nearly 50 million people in California , Oregon and Washington live in counties that experienced at least one day of \u201c unhealthy \u201d or worse air quality during wildfire season in 2020 .\nThat \u2019 s 1 in 7 Americans , an increase of more than 9 million people compared with 2018 , the worst previous year .\nDemographics for those considered \u201c sensitive \u201d to air pollution make up about 30 percent of the U.S. population : children under 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pregnant and those with medical conditions including heart or lung disease , COPD , asthma , diabetes or compromised immune systems .\nUnfortunately , wildfire smoke contains more than particulate matter .\nBurning trees and bushes give off solvents ( benzene , formaldehyde , toluene , xylene ) , harmful gases like ozone , nitrogen and sulfur dioxide , carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants like acrolein .\nThe further the smoke drifts , the more ozone is created when the gases in the smoke are exposed to sunlight and nitrous oxide .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributing to damage that can cause COPD in both adults and children .\nWoodsmoke also contains arsenic , mercury , and PAH ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) -all known carcinogens and DNA-damaging toxicants .\nWildfire smoke , also known as carbon black , appears to cause glutathione depletion in macrophages and monocytes and also causes massive amounts of ROS ( reactive oxygen species aka free radicals ) which not surprisingly , also contributes to lower levels of glutathione .\nThese ROS ( particularly hydroxyl radicals ) have been identified as the culprit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A recent study on wildfire smoke exposure was conducted in Seeley Lake , MT ( outside of Missoula ) where residents experienced an average AQI of 220.9 \u03bcg/m3 for 6 weeks in the summer of 2017 .\nFollow-up in 2018 and 2019 showed that the residents ( specifically those over 65 ) had a significant decrease in lung function ( FEV1/FVC ratio : forced expiratory volume /forced vital capacity ) .\nMore than twice the number of participants fell below the lower limit of normal than would have been expected one year following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 to 45.9 % in 2018 ) .\nThis decrease in lung function remained two years post exposure in 34 % of the tested population .\nThe study authors concluded that the period of 6 weeks of exposure of AIQ around 220 had long lasting effects .\nAlthough the median age in this study was 63 ( so more likely to have respiratory problems ) , the decline in lung function was greater than expected for that age group .\nFEV1 values are used to determine whether lung function is declining at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Mayo Clinic , the expected annual decline in pulmonary function in FEV1 is 30 mL for males and 25 mL for women .\nThe Seeley Lake cohort ( specifically those without woodstoves ) saw a decline in their FEV1 from 289.3 to 189.7 mL = 100 mL over a one year period of time , 3-4 times the expected decline .\nAnother study revealed that after severe fire seasons influenza was three to five times worse during the traditional flu season of fall and winter .\nThis study identified that after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the number of annual flu cases in Montana jumped from the typical 3,000 to around 12,000 , far above any historical fluctuation .\nThe following section of this article includes the link between exposure to PM2.5 , lung damage , and systemic inflammation .\nPlease follow this deep dive into pathophysiology as it is crucial to understand the link between PM2.5 exposure and Covid-19 vulnerability .\nIf you want to skip the science go to the end of the article for recommendations on protection .\nPM2.5 ( or smaller ) in fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with endothelial dysfunction , systemic inflammatory and oxidative stress responses and the progression of atherosclerosis .\nAnd chronic exposure to PM2.5 leads to chronic pulmonary inflammation and sets the stage for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , which affects 12\u201316 million people in the United States and is the third-leading cause of death .\nAlveolar macrophages , think of them as the waste removal service of the body , process inhaled particulate matter\u2014everything from \u201c soot \u201d ( PM 10 ) to fine ( PM 2.5 \u03bcm or less ) and ultrafine ( 0.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macrophages function normally to surround these particles\u2014which include metal ( lead , iron , etc . )\nnanoparticles and PAH ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) and to evacuate them from the lungs via the lymphatic circulation .\nAs a result of contact between these particles ( PM 2.5 in particular ) and the lung lining , phospholipids in the lung tissue are oxidized and stimulate the activation of the alveolar macrophages generating reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .\nIn response to big particles of wildfire smoke ( PM10 ) the lungs produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 ( IL-6 ) , and cyclo-oxygenase 2 ( COX-2 ) -all mediators of inflammation that upregulate oxidant stress .\nThis innate immune response results in the elevation of other mediators of inflammation , including the production of nuclear factor ( NF ) -\u03baB and interleukin ( IL ) -1\u03b2 .\nEven though the mechanism responsible for this damage starts with local macrophage activation , it initiates a cellular inflammatory response throughout the body , specifically in the sensitive endothelial lining of the circulatory system .\nThis response is like an alarm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire vascular system , causing inflammation and potential formation of both microthrombi and emboli .\nThis is one of the mechanisms for particulate matter exposure in air pollution that leads to cardiovascular disease .\nIn animal models , exposure to PM2.5 leads to decreased prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times ( decreased plasma clotting times ) , increased levels of fibrinogen , and increased activity of factor II , VIII , and X .\nThe animals that could not produce IL-6 were protected from the prothrombotic effect of particulate matter exposure , indicating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammatory response .\nThis systemic response includes not just an upregulation of IL-6 , but more oxidative stress , activation of Toll-Like Receptor4 and activation of NADPH oxidase ( NOX ) dependent pathways .\nIn addition to causing vascular injury , this series of inflammatory events has also been shown to cause acute lung injury and is the same mechanism in H5N1 , SARS , and some features of COVID-19 .\nThe average arteriole is between 0.3 mm and 10 microns ( \u00b5m ) in diameter , and ultrafine particulate matter ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes everything with a diameter of 1.0 mm or less .\nUltrafine particulate matter easily makes it way into the arterial system- not just in the lungs- but throughout the body and can be found embedded in the endothelial lining of arteries and arterioles , causing local and systemic inflammation .\nThis is the mechanism through which particulate matter causes cardiovascular disease , where the presence of particulate matter in the linings of the vascular system directly triggers the inflammasome .\nThe inflammasome complex is part of the innate immunity \u2019 s early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a response to environmental pollutants or endogenous toxic substances ( including those resulting from infections ) .\nThere are 5 classes of inflammasomes found both inside the cell and on the cell membrane to cover every level of potential threat to the cell .\nInside the cell , the NLRP3 inflammasome \u2013 the most well characterized of all the proteins- can assemble into an active defense system when danger threatens the cell .\nObviously , this is not a mistake- the inflammasome originally evolved to protect the body and this inflammatory response has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotes T-cell survival , B-cell proliferation , and antibody production , and supports the migration of leukocytes to a site of infection and invasion .\nIL-18 can act with IL-12 to induce interferon-\u03b3 ( IFN\u03b3 ) production by activating T- and NK-cells .\nThis is all an efficient way to mobilize innate immunity and is meant , over the short-term , to attack , disarm , kill , and eliminate pathogens and foreign invaders- engulfing foreign matter for export and eliminating particulate matter and toxicants through the lymphatic channels .\nExposure to PM2.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing lung inflammation via potent IL-1\u03b2 secretion , as particulate matter in the lungs activates the NLRP3 inflammasome .\nHowever , when chronically activated , the inflammasome promotes damaging responses found in what are now called \u201c autoinflammatory \u201d disease \u201d : obesity , type2 diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , osteoarthritis , atherosclerosis , Alzheimer \u2019 s disease , Parkinson \u2019 s disease , and cancer .\nAnd as mentioned above , this list also includes asthma and COPD .\nThis theory has been validated by a recent analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Health which showed that there is strong evidence that wildfires have amplified the effect of PM2.5 on COVID-19 cases and deaths .\nThey looked at 133 counties in three states ( California , Washington , and Oregon ) from March 15 to 1 December 16 , 2020 ( a total of 277 days ) and saw a significant increase in Covid19 mortality related to wildfire smoke PM2.5 levels directly preceding the increased deaths .\nEmerging evidence is beginning to show that PM2.5 from wildfire smoke may actually be more damaging to health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism for this damage is the effect of wildfire smoke on the immune systems Th1/Th2 balance .\nAir pollutants in PM2.5 particles stimulate pro-inflammatory immune responses across multiple classes of immune cells .\nPM2.5 can enhance T helper lymphocyte type 2 ( Th2 ) and T helper lymphocyte type 17 ( Th17 ) adaptive immune responses , as seen in allergy and asthma , and dysregulate anti-viral immune responses .\nAlthough we originally understood that fatal infections with SARS-CoV2 were from acute respiratory distress and cytokine storm , it is now been shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure , stroke , myocardial injury , arrhythmias , coagulopathy , kidney failure , and secondary bacterial infections and that COVID-19\u2013induced mortality and morbidity is due to an \u201c immunological collapse \u201d characterized by a loss of B and T cells in the spleen and secondary lymphoid organs .\nTo summarize , PM2.5 can induce inflammation , increase risk for clotting and microthrombi , initiate immune dysfunction , and cause \u201c autoinflammatory disease \u201d and these are the reasons that air pollution may have a direct effect on increasing risk for Covid-19 infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respiratory , cardiac , and immune stress individuals are currently experiencing from wildfire smoke and the significant risk for damage to the lungs and vascular system , what affordable , safe interventions can be used prophylactically ?\nAs always , the first rule of toxicology is to remove the exposed individual from the environment or protect them from exposure , but with prolonged wildfire smoke exposure masking and indoor air filters may not be sufficient to protect vulnerable populations from exposure .\nResearch looking at plant extracts and nutrients may be strategies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reducing potential ongoing damage from fire smoke and air pollution exposure .\nThere are interventions that have been shown to assist with PM2.5 exposure : \u2022 Sulforaphane 30-50 mg. day for adults in a highly polluted city in China increased the ability to detoxify air pollution exposure via glutathione-conjugated pollutant excretion ( glutathione-derived conjugates of benzene and acrolein ) .\nSulforaphane is also available OTC and can be obtained in significant quantities through dietary sources- the highest concentration is found in broccoli sprouts- which are inexpensive when grown at home .\nAccording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences , at Johns Hopkins Univ .\nSchool of Medicine \u2013 broccoli sprouts contain approximately 250 mg. sulforaphane per 100 gram serving .\n\u2022 NAC ( typical adult dose 1800 mg/d weight based dose 30 mg/kg max dose 2500 mg ) reduces lung inflammation , corrects the reduction in GSH levels and airway reactivity from diesel particle exhaust , and blocks pro-inflammatory cytokine production .\nNAC is available OTC- the only contraindication is peptic ulcer .\n\u2022 B vitamins : 2.5 mg/d folic acid , 50 mg/d vitamin B6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 4 weeks significantly reduced the inflammatory effects of PM2.5 on heart rate variability ( 90 % ) , normalized heart rate , WBC count and lymphocyte count .\n( This study did not include testing for MTHFR or other single nucleotide polymorphisms in study participants so guidance for those with methylation snps would include methylfolate and methylB12 ) \u2022 1.6 gram EPA/DHA qd significantly decreased the effect of PM2.5 on heart rate variability .\n\u2022 3.0 grams of virgin olive oil in volunteers exposed to PM2.5 was able to prevent the vascular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with vasoconstriction and fibrinolysis .\n\u2022 Vit .\nC ( up to 500 mg. qid ) and vit .\nE ( up to 800 IU qd ) has resulted in : decreased airway irritation from NO2 exposure , improved airway function in children with asthma exposed to ozone , improved airflow in adults after ozone exposure and increased blood GSH/SOD/catalase levels in adults exposed to pollution from coal-fired power plants .\n\u2022 The polyphenol resveratrol has been shown to alleviate chronic \u201c real-world \u201d ambient particulate matter-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis by inhibiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 100 mg/kg.bw .\nResveratrol has also been shown to protect lung epithelial cells from damage by cigarette smoke exposure via the promotion of glutathione production intracellulary .\nStudies have evaluated the activity of a resveratrol derivative in effectively reducing NF-kB-related inflammation in an animal model of acute lung injury .\nResveratrol has also been shown to protect lung epithelia against the effects of cigarette smoke by upregulating Nrf2 to promote glutathione production intracellularly .\nIn animal models of inflammation resveratrol has been shown to be effective in upregulating SIRT1 , and inhibiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in animal models , has been shown to significantly alleviate asthma , inhibit mucus overproduction and down- regulate the inflammatory mediator TGF-\u03b21 .\nThere are no extensive clinical studies using resveratrol in asthma , but it has been shown to have significant anti-inflammatory effects in cardiac disease .\nIn a clinical study of 60 cardiac failure patients ( half of them were given 100 mg. resveratrol daily for 3 months ) the results were significant .\nExercise capacity , ventilation parameters and quality of life improved dramatically in the resveratrol group .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IL-6 and IL-1 were significantly lowered in the patients on resveratrol .\nResveratrol has also been shown to protect lung epithelial cells from damage by cigarette smoke exposure via the promotion of glutathione production intracellularly ( where it counts ) .\nCardiac failure occurs in an environment of oxidative stress and resveratrol has been shown to have positive antioxidant effects in cardiac and vascular pathologies by increasing endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS )

member Ronald Hoffman , MD , provides answers to questions about how to prepare before the vaccine and what to do after vaccination .\nNote : This article is adapted from an earlier post by Dr. Ron Hoffman .\nANH believes individuals should have the choice to take or not take the COVID vaccine .\nAs such , we want to provide information on questions we \u2019 ve been receiving from members considering the vaccine .\nIt \u2019 s acknowledged that \u201c results may vary \u201d when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminary trials showed that Covid shots were 90 % , 95 % , or 76 % \u201c effective \u201d ( take your pick ) , there \u2019 s lots of inter-individual variation .\nResearch protocols for new drugs or vaccines are notorious for cherry-picking younger , healthier subjects to game the system for approval .\nPrecisely the individuals at highest risk of getting very sick or dying from COVID-19 are less likely to be included .\nWhen they are , as with Astra-Zeneca trials in Europe , lasting protection waned for vaccine recipients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which led to hesitancy by some EU countries to authorize the vaccine for the very seniors known to be most vulnerable .\nThis is due to immunosenescence , the natural tendency for immunity and vaccine responsiveness to wane with age .\nIt \u2019 s the reason that seniors are given a special version of the flu shot , which is more powerful than the regular vaccine .\nThere \u2019 s plenty of evidence that a significant number of Americans\u2014regardless of age\u2014are nutritionally deficient .\nSurveys reveal that high double digits of the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like vitamin D , zinc , selenium , and magnesium , to name but a few .\nSeveral of these nutrients are now undergoing intensive investigation to see if they could curb the severity of COVID-19 infections .\nBut whether they \u201c boost \u201d vaccines is different .\nThere are as yet NO studies or clinical trials that correlate low levels of critical nutrients with COVID-19 vaccine efficacy .\nPlus , theoretically , heightening the immune response to the vaccine might increase the danger of side effects .\nFor the vaccine to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Goldilocks immunity \u201d \u2014not too hot , and not too cold , but just right .\nThat some nutrients may play a role in preparing someone for a COVID-19 vaccine might seem plausible , but is entirely speculative .\nIt \u2019 s an untested hypothesis , or rather a collection of hypotheses , because there are multiple ingredients\u2014and none have been specifically vetted for enhancing COVID-19 vaccines , or preventing side effects .\nSo what \u2019 s the take-home for Americans queuing up for their vaccines ?\nI think it \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate amounts of all the key vitamins and minerals prior to your shot .\nJudging from the benign reactions of all my vaccine-recipient patients who take high doses of vitamin D , I see no reason to discontinue it either .\nAs to those \u201c immune boosters \u201d , like elderberry , mushroom extracts , astragalus , and beta-glucans , while they may protect against COVID-19 , I \u2019 m not convinced they \u2019 re needed when getting the vaccine .\nAnd they may stoke immune responses to the vaccine , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk for allergic or autoimmune reactions , or else general malaise , fever , or soreness at the injection site .\nWe simply don \u2019 t know , so why go there ?\nQuercetin is probably OK with its anti-inflammatory effects , as is fish oil .\nBoth may tamp down adverse vaccine reactions without compromising immunity .\nDo you need glutamine and branched chain amino acids ?\nProbably not .\nWhile it \u2019 s true that your body needs protein building blocks to synthesize the antibodies that will protect you from COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat \u2019 s why it \u2019 s probably not a good idea to short-change yourself by fasting , or going on a juice detox at the time of your shot , although it probably won \u2019 t matter much .\nGlutamine might support glutathione synthesis , especially necessary if you take acetaminophen to quell a vaccine reaction .\nTylenol depletes glutathione , so I tell patients who take it to add N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) 500-600 mg 2 or 3 times per day as a countermeasure .\nAnd , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effectiveness of the vaccine .\nAnd probiotics make sense for immunity , but there \u2019 s no evidence they \u2019 re decisive for vaccine effectiveness .\nWhen it comes to diet , one intriguing study suggests that \u201c Increased fruit and vegetable intake improves the Pneumovax II vaccination antibody response in older people , which links an achievable dietary goal with improved immune function.\n\u201d Additionally , it \u2019 s probably a good idea to limit your refined carbohydrate intake for a few days around vaccine administration , notwithstanding Krispy Kreme \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free glazed donuts on presentation of a vaccine certificate .\nDr. Jeff Bland reported to me in a recent podcast that , even though he experienced only minor symptoms with the covid shot , the continuous glucose monitor he was wearing registered significant short-term deterioration of his tight blood sugar control in the immediate aftermath of his vaccination .\nIt \u2019 s also a good idea to make sure you get adequate sleep and allow time for ample rest when you obtain the shot .\nKeep workouts moderate and pace yourself according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunosuppressive .\nAnd don \u2019 t forget to hydrate\u2014adequate fluid consumption may ease side effects .\nHow \u2018 bout some comforting chicken soup with plenty of vegetables ?", "author": "ANH-USA", "url":

"Now doctors are being threatened with the loss of their license if they fail to toe the line of mainstream medicine on how to prevent and treat COVID .\nThe Federation of State Medical Boards ( FSMB ) recently announced that doctors who \u201c spread COVID-19 vaccine misinformation \u201d risk disciplinary action by state medical boards , including the revocation of their medical license .\nThe

the pandemic is that available information can change , often quite rapidly .\nThe CDC \u2019 s masking guidelines changed multiple times .\nInitially we were told that the virus could be spread on surfaces before subsequent investigations revealed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ droplets containing the virus are inhaled .\nAs we \u2019 ve said before , the Wuhan lab leak theory was first dismissed as a conspiracy theory , but is now acknowledged as a legitimate , even likely , explanation of the virus \u2019 origin .\nOften the \u201c misinformation \u201d of today becomes the established facts of tomorrow .\nTake ivermectin , for example .\nInformed consent legally requires your doctor to discuss the risks and benefits of alternatives to vaccines to address COVID-19 .\nWould it be misinformation to talk about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evidence that recommends its use to prevent and treat COVID-19 ?\nIs a doctor risking their license if they talk about the drop in COVID case counts in South American cities that instituted massive , prophylactic ivermectin distribution campaigns compared to cities that didn \u2019 t ?\nDespite this compelling evidence , the FDA stubbornly recommends against using ivermectin for COVID , likely because Big Pharma and their government cronies want mandatory vaccines , not ivermectin , as the answer to COVID because vaccines will make the most money .\nThe ABEM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d may be in response to the MATH+ protocol developed by the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance for hospitalized COVID patients .\nTheir protocol includes proven natural medicines like vitamin C , zinc , melatonin , and vitamin D ( in addition to ivermectin and other medicines ) .\nSupplements like these are generally not patentable and thus unable to become FDA approved for the treatment of COVID , which requires expensive clinical trials .\nThis is why the FDA and FTC launched a massive censorship campaign to silence discussion of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with COVID .\nIt is shameful that doctors may risk their medical license by discussing these plausible alternatives for addressing COVID .\nThe vaccination issue has become a highly controversial topic with strong feelings on all sides .\nThe government is recommending COVID vaccination for almost everyone above the age of 12 .\nInformed consent legally requires doctors to discuss the risks and benefits of any medical procedure .\nIs it spreading \u201c misinformation \u201d to discuss with patients the 488,318 adverse events , including close to 5,000 deaths , reported in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System ( VAERS ) ?\nThis isn \u2019 t hyperbole .\nWe saw one \u201c fact-checker \u201d call out a post citing VAERS data as false because , the fact-checker claimed , VAERS is unreliable and doesn \u2019 t establish causation .\nThat is true , but it \u2019 s also true that a major limitation of VAERS is that adverse events are severely underreported , perhaps even less than 1 percent .\nThis would mean that VAERS arguably understates the dangers and side effects caused by vaccines .\nIs it \u201c misinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these facts ?\nIs it \u201c misinformation \u201d if you have an autoimmune condition and your doctor warns that you may be at increased risk of serious adverse events like blood clots , as we discussed in our Right to kNOw

of the American workforce requiring millions of Americans to get vaccinated .\nAction Alert !\nPresident Biden recently signed an Executive Order requiring all federal executive branch employees to be vaccinated , in addition to contractor employees that do business with the government .\nOther mandates for healthcare workers and private employers with more than 100 employees were issued as part of the President \u2019 s COVID-19 Action Plan .\nSeparately , the Department of Health and Human Services will require vaccinations for employees in the Head Start program , affecting about 300,000 workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandates for over 100 million workers , over two-thirds of the American workforce .\nNote that these orders only provide a negative test option to the private employers with 100 or more employees .\nFor the others , there is no testing option\u2014they must receive the shots .\nThis is an unprecedented exercise of federal power .\nVaccine exemptions and mandates have , up to this point , been left to the states .\nThe order is expected to be challenged by both employers and states .\nPresident Biden is using the Occupational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to institute the private employer mandate .\nThe legality of OSHA passing a rule to mandate a vaccine or testing for private employers is in serious question and will have to be decided in court .\nOSHA can legally issue an Emergency Temporary Standard ( ETS ) , which takes effect as soon as it is released .\nOSHA can only issue an ETS if it determines that \u201c employees are exposed to grave danger \u201d from exposure to harmful substances or agents ; further , the ETS must be determined to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger.\n\u201d It is of course highly contestable that COVID vaccines meet these standards .\nAs constitutional legal expert Jonathan Emord , Esq .\npoints out , a large number of workers telecommute , work outside , have naturally-acquired immunity , or are in a low-risk category ( young and healthy ) , meaning that the legal requirements for OSHA to issue an ETS are not met .\nStates and other groups have indicated plans to challenge the forthcoming rule in court .\nPresident Biden \u2019 s Executive Order states that the mandates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required by law.\n\u201d The law allows for a medical exemption under the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) and a religious exemption under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .\nThe White House has confirmed that these exemptions will apply to the federal employee mandate .\nThe medical exemption provided by the ADA is quite limited .\nIt is unlikely that those with autoimmune conditions would qualify for an exemption under the ADA .\nIt also seems that people who have had an allergic reaction to an ingredient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or PEG ) will also qualify for a medical exemption , as the CDC states that those who have had such reactions to an ingredient in the COVID vaccine , even if the reaction wasn \u2019 t severe , should not get either shot .\nReligious exemptions are likely a better option for those looking to avoid mandatory vaccination .\n\u201c Religion \u201d is defined broadly for these purposes in the statute to the benefit of employees .\nEmployees stating that the vaccination violates a religious belief\u2014as opposed to a social or political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doubt by their employers .\nEmployers can , however , request additional supporting information .\nStill , a religious exemption is not guaranteed , and the difficulty in claiming a religious exemption varies by state and by entity .\nIn Tucson , Arizona , four administrators were assigned to sort through nearly 300 requests for religious exemptions to the city \u2019 s vaccine mandate for its public employees ; just over half have been approved so far and 15 have been denied .\nWe can likely expect the same level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessing requests for religious exemptions .\nNevertheless , religious exemptions may be the only option for most individuals seeking to avoid the mandates , given the restrictive medical exemption .\nNote , though , that being vaccinated doesn \u2019 t make you less likely to spread the

ineffective at stimulating this secretion of antibodies in the nose .\nFurther , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced effectiveness against the delta variant that is the dominant strain now .\nThe point is that vaccination status is not a guarantee that an individual is not infected and capable of spreading the virus to others , meaning that vaccine mandates are not only coercive , they do not accomplish one

\u201d requirement that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major changes in the law and to block this \u201c mandatory list \u201d from ever passing to protect our access to important supplements .\nResveratrol has been available as a supplement for years .\nBut we know from FDA documents that the agency rejected a \u201c new supplement \u201d notification for resveratrol , stating that resveratrol doesn \u2019 t meet the legal definition of a supplement because a drug company started investigating it as a drug in 2001 , and the agency has no evidence that resveratrol was sold as a supplement before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug company could , at any time , petition the FDA to remove resveratrol supplements from the market .\nThis is what happened to pyridoxamine , a form of B6 , and it still isn \u2019 t

supplement introduced to the market in the US after 1994 is considered \u201c new \u201d ( a new dietary ingredient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must notify the FDA in advance of marketing the product .\nAccording to FDA rules , if a drug company starts investigating an ingredient as a drug before a \u201c new supplement \u201d notification has been successfully filed , the drug company can ask the FDA to have the supplement version removed from the market .\nIt has now been 27 years since DSHEA was passed , and the supplement industry has been waiting for the NDI policy ever since .\nSupplement companies do not know which supplements require an NDI notification or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a submission .\nIn the meantime , pharmaceutical companies are taking advantage of the confusion by snatching up nutrients and turning them into drugs .\nThere are other serious problems with the NDI guidance we \u2019 ve covered many times .\nWe \u2019 ve been advocating for a number of changes to the FDA \u2019 s guidance that would protect supplements , including a broader definition of \u201c grandfathered \u201d supplements that are pre-1994 and do not need \u201c new supplement \u201d notifications .\nBut

!\nTwo federal bills would mandate vaccination for air travel in the United States .\nOne bill includes an option to provide a negative COVID test , but this provision could be removed by the time the bill becomes law .\nSeparately , the Biden administration has said that they are not ruling out the possibility of issuing an order mandating COVID vaccination as a condition for air travel .\nGiven the massive mandate for two-thirds of the American workforce recently issued by the Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems likely .\nWe must voice our opposition to these mandates .\nThere have been efforts in Congress to head off vaccination mandates for air travel that have so far been unsuccessful .\nAmong dozens of amendments proposed to a transportation spending bill , one sought to block the money from being spent if COVID-19 vaccine requirements became a condition of entering federal buildings ; another amendment extended this to vaccine requirements for flights .\nBoth were rejected .\nThey could be added to later bills , but it is good to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice .\nBut as we saw with the recent vaccine mandates for the American workforce , the most likely scenario for air travel mandates seems to be executive action from the Biden administration .\nIn an interview , Dr. Anthony Fauci , Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Chief Medical Advisor to the President , said he would support such a mandate .\nFormer President Obama \u2019 s Transportation Secretary also said the Biden administration should issue a vaccine requirement for air travel .\nSome airlines have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the Australian airline Qantas has said that it will require passengers to be vaccinated for international flights .\nThe airline industry has voiced opposition to a vaccine requirement for passengers , saying that it would be \u201c logistically impractical \u201d and would \u201c bottleneck the domestic travel system.\n\u201d What exemptions would apply in the event of an air travel vaccine mandate ?\nAs we described previously , the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) and the Civil Rights Act prohibit employers , but also businesses serving the public , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on their religion , race , and sex .\nNote , though , that those who qualify for these exemptions would not necessarily be granted the right to walk on any flight they choose ; they should be entitled to \u201c reasonable accommodation , \u201d unless doing so would pose \u201c undue hardship \u201d on the business .\nFor instance , a grocery store may prohibit unvaccinated patrons from entering the store but provide curbside pickup to those who qualify for exemptions under the ADA or the Civil Rights Act .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mean is unclear ; airlines could argue that accommodating unvaccinated passengers , for example with dedicated flights for the unvaccinated , would be an \u201c undue hardship , \u201d so they would be banned .\nEmployees who are subject to the mandates announced last week who qualify for exemptions are also entitled to reasonable accommodation of their disability or religious belief .\nThe medical exemption provided by the ADA is quite limited , as we explained previously .\nWe also recently covered religious exemptions to mandates provided by the Civil Rights Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 , which prohibits the federal government from substantially burdening a person \u2019 s exercise of religion except in limited circumstances .\nOnce an individual establishes that a law caused a substantial burden , the government would need to show that the burden imposed furthers a \u201c compelling governmental interest \u201d and is \u201c the least restrictive means \u201d of furthering that interest .\nIt could be argued that a vaccine mandate is not the \u201c least restrictive means \u201d of containing the spread of COVID in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective on the effectiveness of the COVID vaccines .\nWe often hear the stat that the COVID vaccines are 95 percent effective .\nThis means that , in the conditions of a clinical trial , when a vaccinated person was exposed to the virus , their likelihood of developing serious COVID disease and hospitalization was 95 percent less than that of an unvaccinated person .\nBut this doesn \u2019

worked well to prevent serious COVID disease in the clinical trials , but at the same time the overall risk of developing serious COVID disease was only one percent .\n( See here and here for more explanation ) .\nANH has been , and remains , firmly opposed to vaccine mandates .\nWe are not anti-vaccine .\nWe believe each individual has the right to make decisions about the medical procedures they receive .\nAll medical procedures come with risks and benefits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTo us , it is unreasonable to force individuals , particularly those who are at increased risk\u2014like autoimmune patients\u2014to undergo a procedure that could do them harm .\nContaining the spread of the virus is undoubtedly an admirable goal , but a better balance must be struck between adopting measures to contain the virus \u2019 spread and the preservation of personal autonomy\u2014especially given that the overall risk reduction from the vaccines is 1 percent .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to

America , this inflexion happened around 1870 , while in Africa and much of Asia , it was delayed until around the 1920s .\nSo what caused people to suddenly start living a lot longer ?\nWas it modern

Second World War .\nVaccines had been used from Edward Jenner \u2019 s time and don \u2019 t seem to have caused population-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credible analyses argue it wasn \u2019 t modern medicine

"\u2026by focusing almost exclusively on masking , social distancing , and vaccinations and ignoring what sick people could do at home to avoid hospitalization .\nAction Alert !\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in many ways , but in other ways it is just like any other illness .\nYet in addressing this illness , public health authorities have inexplicably departed from standard medical norms .\nThe critical error here , as described by Peter McCullough , MD , is that early , at-home treatment for sick patients with COVID-19 was not only completely ignored , but information describing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed .\nThis represents a massive failure in the public health establishment that has cost thousands of lives .\nIt is an astounding truth that no information is provided to patients receiving a positive COVID test about how they can proactively manage their health .\nThe guidelines from the National Institutes of Health are essentially to stay at home , self-isolate , wash your hands , and wait until you need to go to the hospital .\nBut as Dr. McCullough points out , at that point it is already too late .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital who need oxygen had a 12 percent mortality rate ; patients who needed a ventilator had a 24 percent mortality rate .\nWhy are health authorities waiting for patients to become so sick that 12 to 24 percent are going to die ?\nCan nothing be done to avoid these outcomes ?\nCan we imagine a situation in which a patient given a cancer diagnosis is told to go home and wait until they \u2019 re so sick they need to go to the hospital ?\nThe fact is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early phases at home in many cases .\nDr. McCullough released the first paper of the pandemic describing a multi-drug approach for early , at-home treatment to slow viral replication ( using zinc and antimalarial drugs ) , address the cytokine storm ( using immunomodulators like colchicine ) , and to prevent thrombosis , or clotting events ( using antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications ) .\nThese therapies address the three main stages of COVID-19 disease progression .\nStudies that utilized this approach showed an 85 percent reduction in mortality .\nIf a treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 85 percent , it would be national news and the researchers would receive a Nobel Prize .\nWhy aren \u2019 t these results being shouted from the rooftops by every doctor and public health authority in the country ?\nBecause none of these drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of COVID-19 .\nIn fact the government agencies in some cases warn patients off of these treatments .\nDoctors who spoke about them were censored and had their medical licenses threatened .\nMeanwhile , in other countries , it is standard practice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that include these types of medicines .\nThat at-home , early treatment of COVID-19 has been downplayed , even silenced , is a travesty .\nIn a pandemic situation , it is lunacy for government agencies to insist that we adhere to the drug approval model , which essentially says that , for a treatment to be recognized , you need two trials on a single drug targeted at a single outcome that demonstrate efficacy .\nBut as Dr. McCullough points out , there aren \u2019 t randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pandemic situation we can \u2019 t wait for those trials , either .\nIf this was the standard , he argues , we wouldn \u2019 t be able to treat HIV , which isn \u2019 t responsive to just one drug .\nThe same goes for cancer ; no doctor would say that one drug can address cancer .\nDoctors routinely use drugs in combination with each other\u2014not even strep throat is treated with a single drug .\nMedicine is a science and an art , requiring doctors to make judgments .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week at home for COVID disease to hospitalize or kill patients , judgments can be made based on available evidence to use a combination of medicines that can plausibly help patients\u2014as we would do for someone who gets pneumonia , or a child with asthma , or a patient with any other illness .\nSimilarly , an antimalarial , or a blood thinner , or an anti-inflammatory to address the cytokine storm in COVID-19 , may not be efficacious if studied in isolation .\nBut that is what the FDA drug model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , improve mortality ?\nIf not , you better shut up about it or face sanctions from the government and possibly your state medical board .\nAll of this underlines how broken the healthcare system in this country is .\nBig Pharma and their government cronies want mandatory vaccines , not cheap , off-patent drugs , as the answer to COVID because vaccines will make the most money .\nWhy spend the exorbitant sums on clinical trials for off-patent medicines for COVID when the patent protection wouldn \u2019 t be as strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than for new drugs , and the potential pool of patients is substantially smaller than for vaccines , since everyone , sick or not , gets the vaccine while only those who are sick would receive a drug for COVID ?\nWe \u2019 ve discussed supplement protocols for COVID treatment and prevention previously , including the use of vitamin D , vitamin C , zinc , quercetin , and melatonin .\nThe Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance , in addition to these aforementioned supplements , also recommends the prophylactic use of ivermectin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will continue to pay exorbitant prices for worse health outcomes .\nOne solution is for Congress to allow the free flow of information about supplements and allow these products to cite peer-reviewed studies describing their benefits .\nAction Alert !\nWrite to Congress in support of our legislation to allow the free flow of information

chemical reaches a certain threshold .\nEPA scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk .\nBut a manager changed the assessment to say that cancer was not a concern because the chemical would be diluted in the air upon release .\nWe \u2019 re increasingly learning that these chemicals do , in fact , pose a danger , especially to the communities situated near chemical plants .\nWe \u2019 ve seen a similar effect

health , for example\u2014without some of the dangers that accompany higher-potency estrogens , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many , many women .\nNote that there is no FDA-approved bioidentical estriol , so a ban on the compounded form would eliminate access completely .\nThe FDA and NASEM are conscious that many , many women prefer compounded hormones to conventional hormone replacement

have with these medicines .\nOprah Winfrey once said , \u201c After one day on bioidentical estrogen , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been echoed by many other patients who feel transformed after using

black-and-white thinking on health and well-being .\nIn the early twentieth century , the Flexner Report asserted the preeminence of the \u201c biomedical model \u201d over traditional folk medicines that were still widely embraced by Americans .\nMedical research was advancing in the wake of Louis Pasteur ( the Germ Theory ) and Paul Ehrlich ( synthetic drugs as \u201c magic bullets \u201d ) .\nFollowing the German model , doctors were to be trained as scientists embracing the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicine had a lot to live down .\nDangerous , unregulated patent medications containing mercury , petroleum and opium were rampant .\nObsolete practices like bloodletting dispatched thousands .\nPsychiatric patients were consigned to cruel asylums .\nProgress notwithstanding in the wake of the Flexner reforms in the 20th century , a tension developed between the new academic medicine and the traditional healing modalities .\nIt has been epitomized in the long-term conflict between chiropractors and their orthodox medicine foes ; to this day , mainstream medicine skeptics denounce chiropractic , acupuncture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nMeanwhile , medical consumers became increasingly disillusioned with the \u201c advances \u201d of healthcare .\nThey were subject to horrendous drug side effects ; massive recalls highlighted safety issues with \u201c breakthrough \u201d medications ; medical care became increasingly depersonalized ; antibiotic resistance threatened to reverse gains against infectious disease ; millions became addicted to drugs whose abuse potential was downplayed ; the costs of treatment became astronomical ; and the exalted popular image of doctors substantially eroded .\nWhere mainstream medicine ventured into lifestyle recommendations , it got it wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat and cholesterol , when processed food and refined carbs were the culprits ; it missed the boat on universal recommendations for salt avoidance , when only a minority of people require restriction ; dangerous sleeping pills supplanted practical , natural sleep hygiene recommendations ; vitamins and supplements , with their documented benefits , were uncritically panned by medical authorities ; and surgery and drugs were indiscriminately deployed for pain problems in lieu of safer , gentler interventions with exercise , physical therapy , and traditional healing practices .\nIn response to widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrived .\nThe establishment of scientifically grounded naturopathic schools brought rigor to the training of natural medicine practitioners ; conferences and training programs for doctors familiarizing them with natural approaches proliferated : more Americans than ever embraced nutritional supplements ; and while the general quality of the American diet has deteriorated , more of us than ever are taking advantage of cleaner options , giving rise to health megastores like Whole Foods .\nSome of this renunciation of conventional medicine\u2014rightly or wrongly , and we won \u2019 t debate the merits here\u2014has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some , vaccines represent the intrusion of uncertain technology into our sacred personal biological terrain .\nAlong comes Covid , an unprecedented crisis .\nFor context , I \u2019 m well aware , because I trained and began practicing during the height of the AIDS era , that natural modalities in and of themselves are not sufficient to vanquish killer viruses .\nEarly on , before the advent of effective therapies for AIDS , we used guerilla tactics to salvage young lives .\nImmune-supportive supplements , healthy diet , intravenous vitamin C and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed the progression of the disease , but it was not until the advent of antiviral cocktails that patients survived .\nSome of my earliest patients from the 80s are alive today because of them .\nIn fact , I traveled to Washington around 1990 to advocate for research on natural therapies for HIV .\nI met with a young NIH official who was head of the National Institutes for Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the behest of two congressmen , Sen. Tom Harkin and Rep. Berkeley Bedell of the Iowa caucus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine .\nThat official was Dr. Tony Fauci , who listened courteously , aware that two legislators who held his agency \u2019 s purse strings were pushing their agenda with me , but it was clear he was awaiting some pharmaceutical breakthrough to vanquish AIDS , and wasn \u2019 t much interested in anything alternative .\nIt turns out his view was vindicated when drugs revolutionized care of persons with AIDS .\nToday , Dr. Fauci is operating under the same assumptions .\nHe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( \u201c A lot of what you \u2019 re seeing as attacks on me , quite frankly , are attacks on science .\n.\n.\n\u201d ) , consider claims that lifestyle or supplements or cheap repurposed medicines are at best a distraction , at worst a deterrent to getting people to follow official mandates .\nThings are so bad these days that to report on natural support for Covid , even when you don \u2019 t disparage vaccines or antiviral drugs , can get you canceled on social media .\nMany of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural approaches have been deplatformed .\nShort of outright censorship , many purveyors of balanced information have been shadow-banned .\nAlternatively , talking about plausible supplements for immune support can prompt a warning letter from the Federal Trade Commission .\nJust mentioning Covid will get your social media post redirected to an official CDC site whose facts have been vetted for popular consumption .\nNow , you can argue the merits of this strategy\u2014whether , in an emergency , consistent public health messaging should trump rights to free expression\u2014but has there been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter to the mainstream narrative overall ?\nBy that I mean that the pandemic may be putting a stranglehold on communication of legitimate perspectives that may not fit a tightly constrained narrative .\nIntegrative medicine may be collateral damage .\nThe oft-downplayed fact is that hospitalizations and death from Covid are highly correlated to obesity and elevated blood sugar , conditions that have eluded drug treatments , and are most amenable to lifestyle interventions .\nInstead , doesn \u2019 t it seem like the powers-that-be are leveraging the pandemic crisis to root out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it stigmatizes as \u201c misinformation \u201d ?\nYou could make the case that conventional medicine , as a brand , with its arsenal of vaccines , medications , and high-tech innovations , is on trial in the Covid era .\nWill it vanquish the disease with scientific ingenuity , and usher in a new utopian era of cures based on the platforms developed in the rush to address the pandemic ?\nWill innovative , hi-tech biologicals and vaccines conquer infectious diseases , cancer , diabetes , heart disease , Alzheimer \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will today \u2019 s recalcitrants finally turn away from natural solutions ?\nThere \u2019 s a lot at stake , and to my mind there \u2019 s too much either-or thinking around the pandemic .\nWe can appreciate innovative Covid preventives and treatments without abandoning the premise that the true wellsprings of health and immunity derive from lifestyle , comprising diet , sleep , mindfulness , nutrition and movement .\nBut the current fevered climate cultivates reductive

"To what extent are our children endangered by COVID infection ?\nMany parents understandably approached this school year with trepidation at the thought of their children returning to in-person learning during a pandemic and the rise of viral variants .\nA survey of the data we have thus far should provide some comfort to worried parents about the risks faced by children .\nFirst , deaths from COVID among children are very rare .\nAccording to the CDC , there have been 63 deaths from COVID in kids aged 1-4 and 172 deaths in kids aged 5-15 .\nFor all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from COVID .\nThis means that kids aged 1-4 make up 0.008703 percent of COVID deaths , and kids 5-15 make up 0.0238 percent of total COVID deaths .\nHospitalization rates are also much lower for younger age groups .\nAccording to the CDC , there were 87.8 hospitalizations per 100,000 people for those aged 0-4 , and 52.5 hospitalizations per 100,000 people for those aged 5-15 .\nFor comparison , there were 2,000 hospitalizations per 100,000 for those 65 and older , and 1,033 hospitalizations per 100,000 for those aged 50-64 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of total hospitalizations , and kids aged 5-17 make up 1.1 percent of total hospitalizations .\nEven these low number of hospitalizations for kids may be overstated .\nThe CDC requires that every child admitted to the hospital be tested for COVID-19 .\nAccording to one study , 45 % of the time , a child who tested positive for the coronavirus at a hospital was not actually sick with COVID-19 .\nIn those cases , hospitalization was due to a completely unrelated diagnosis .\nThese data have been confirmed in other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that COVID-19 carries a lower risk of death or intensive care among children and young people than previously thought .\nResearchers found that COVID caused 25 deaths in England among those 18 and younger and that half of these were in individuals with an underlying complex disability requiring high health-care needs , such as tube feeding or breathing assistance .\nOne study looked at data from 19 countries and found that conditions such as obesity and cardiac or neurological problems were associated with a higher risk of death or intensive care treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very small .\nThe data also seem to suggest that many children get infected with the virus but are asymptomatic or have mild illness .\nIn testimony before the FDA , Dr. Peter Doshi noted that CDC data showed that 23 percent of 0-4 year olds and 42 percent of 5-17 year olds had already had COVID .\nThe CDC estimates that anywhere between 16 percent and half of pediatric infections are asymptomatic .\nAlthough most children infected with COVID-19 experience mild symptoms , there have been reports of a rare condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( MIS-C ) .\nEstimates are that 0.03 percent of COVID infections in young children lead to MIS-C ; incidence was higher among Black , Hispanic or Latino , and Asian or Pacific Islanders compared with white patients .\nIn cases of MIS-C , different parts of the body become inflamed .\nIt can be deadly , but most children who are diagnosed with the condition get better with medical care .\nIt also seems to be the case that it is less common for children to spread the virus to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult-to-child transmission ; for reasons that are not yet understood , transmission from children to adults and from children to children are less common .\nThis was substantiated by an Australian study which found that children infected with COVID-19 were more likely to have caught it from their parents than at school .\nIn the words of one doctor , \u201c Of the number of children across the globe [ infected with COVID-19 ] , very few are requiring hospitalization , even fewer are requiring ICU , and very , very few die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concern that , although risk of death or serious illness is low in kids , they can still acquire \u201c long COVID.\n\u201d But as reported by our friends at ANH-International , a new review published in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal has cast doubt on previous estimates of the prevalence of long COVID in children and adolescents .\nThe review is backed up by a new report from the Murdoch Children \u2019 s Research Institute ( MCRI ) in Australia , which found major limitations in the data used in existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given these data , there is also a question as to whether the benefits of vaccination for young children outweigh the risks .\nCurrently there is conflicting data on this question .\nOne study , which has not yet been peer-reviewed , found that healthy boys aged 12-15 are four to six times more likely to be diagnosed with vaccine-related myocarditis than end up in the hospital with COVID .\nOn the other hand , another study found that the risk of myocarditis and other serious adverse events was substantially higher with COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An FDA advisory panel recently endorsed the Pfizer COVID shot for 5-11 year olds by a vote of 17-0 with one abstention .\nNote , though , that if the panel did not vote to approve the shots , they would not be available for high-risk kids ; the vote was to approve it for all kids in the age group or none .\nWe don \u2019 t know what the vote would have looked like if panel members had the option to approve the shots just for high-risk kids with serious medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the risk/benefit analysis is quite different .\nFor example , information presented during meeting shows that if infection rates fall , the risks of vaccinating kids

milk has a better nutrient profile and fewer contaminants than conventional milk , but loopholes are allowing fraudulent \u201c organic \u201d milk on the market .\nAction Alert !\nThe fall meeting of the National Organic Standards Board ( NOSB ) included a discussion of the Origin of Livestock rule , which has been in limbo since 2015 .\nThe rule attempts to prevent large , industrial dairy and cattle operations from gaming the system and fooling consumers into buying faux organic products .\nFraudulent organic products undermine regenerative health for humans and the environment .\nWe must urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule , ideally with some changes to strengthen it .\nFirst , organic milk has been shown to be superior to conventional milk in a variety of ways .\nOrganic milk was not shown to contain any pesticides or antibiotics , while these contaminants were prevalent in conventional milk .\nOrganic milk also has a better nutrition profile : a study published in the British Journal of Nutrition showed that organic milk had higher concentrations of iron , vitamin E , selenium , and carotenoids .\nAnother study showed that organic milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 62 percent more omega-3 fatty acids than conventional milk .\nAmericans today eat far more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 \u2019 s , and this distorted ratio is considered one of the more damaging aspects of the American diet .\nThe point is , the difference between organic and conventional milk is important , but faux organic products are allowed on the market due to loopholes in organic rules that must be closed .\nThere are two key issues .\nThe first deals with organic milk .\nIn organic regulations , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion of a conventional dairy herd to an organic herd .\nThe intent of this rule was to allow farmers the flexibility to transition their operation from conventional to organic .\nThis provision has been abused by industrial \u201c organic \u201d dairies that continuously transition non-organic cows to organic : farmers remove organic dairy animals from a herd , raise them using conventional feed and other prohibited management practices , and then re-transition them back to organic .\nThis continuous transitioning of animals allows these industrial producers to grow their dairy herds more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right thing , enabling them to flood the market with cheap \u201c organic \u201d milk .\nConsider that half of organic milk sold in the US comes from concentrated animal feeding operations ( CAFOs ) .\nEstimates are that real organic dairy farmers spend an average of $ 600-1,000 more per calf than farmers who raise calves conventionally and transition them to organic at one year of age .\nThis unlevel playing field has decimated small and mid-sized organic dairies .\nMore than half of the 125,000 dairy farms ( organic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1997 have disappeared .\nFifteen thousand have gone under between 2007 and 2017 .\nThese smaller operations simply can not compete with industrial giants that abuse the spirit , if not the letter , of the law .\nThe second issue involves breeder stock , defined in organic regulation as \u201c female livestock whose offspring may be incorporated into an organic operation at the time of their birth.\n\u201d Breeder stock can be used to diversify the genetic pool of a herd .\nUnder organic regulations , a non-organic cow can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is under organic management from the last third of gestation .\nNote that conventional livestock that have transitioned to organic can not be sold as organic slaughter\u2014only their calves who have been under organic management since the last third of gestation can be sold as organic .\nOnce again , industrial concentrated animal feeding lots ( CAFOs ) are abusing the rule by cycling breeder stock between organic and conventional production .\nThis is particularly a concern with hogs .\nCAFOs can raise a hog non-organically\u2014that is , on GMO feed , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited in organic production\u2014until she is pregnant with a litter .\nThe hog can then transition to organic management until she gives birth .\nThe offspring are organic , and the mother is transitioned back to the non-organic sector .\nAgain , this lowers the cost for CAFOs to produce organic livestock and puts smaller farms following the spirit of organic agriculture at a competitive disadvantage .\nThe NOP \u2019 s proposed rule addresses the first issue but not the second .\nIt amends organic regulations such that the one-time conversion of conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer , rather than a herd ; this change will prohibit the continuous transitioning currently going on in CAFOs .\nThe rule should be strengthened to prohibit the cycling of breeder stock .\nNOP could amend the rule by stipulating that breeder stock can be transitioned only once to organic to prohibit the cycling back and forth , as this practice undermines the basic concept of organic herd health .\nThese issues can get into the weeds , but the overall picture is simple .\nAs we \u2019 ve been reporting for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the integrity of the organic label almost since its inception .\nThey attempt to water down what it means to be organic , or simply commit blatant fraud .\nThese efforts must be opposed .\nReal organic agriculture is key to

essential to protect access to these medicines .\nRecall that estriol and other hormones were nominated to the FDA \u2019 s Demonstrably Difficult to Compound List .\nItems that appear on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounding .\nThe FDA is currently deciding whether these hormones should remain on the list and be banned .\nFrom the beginning , it has been clear that the FDA has carefully managed every step of the process to achieve an intended result : eliminating access to compounded bioidentical hormones to create a monopoly for FDA-approved hormones .\nThis is a critical issue , particularly for women .\nMany studies have shown that estriol offers many potential health benefits\u2014for urinary tract health and bone health , for example\u2014without some of the dangers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA ban would cause suffering for many , many women .\nBut as we \u2019 ve written before , this is one among many attacks that , in our opinion , is meant to make it impossible for traditional compounding pharmacies to stay in business .\nThe FDA still needs to go through the rulemaking process before estriol or other hormones are banned from compounding , but the time to act is now .\nWe must get Congress on our side to try to reign in this agency by getting as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAttacking estriol and compounded hormones to clear the market for FDA-approved hormone drugs is just one of the ways the FDA and the federal government bolster drug monopolies and undermine natural health options .\nThe FDA clearly prefers all medicines to go through its drug approval process requiring clinical trials , because drug user fees constitute 45 percent of the agency \u2019 s annual budget .\nThe problem is that clinical trials for compounded bioidentical hormones are not feasible .\nThe whole point of compounded medicine is that it is tailored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparations of bioidentical hormones that are used for the millions of women who rely on these medicines ; does the FDA expect clinical trials for every single hormone preparation that is compounded ?\nNo one will pay for these trials because hormones have been used for decades are not strongly patentable .\nThese are the same dynamics that keep supplements from going through FDA approval .\nUntil this system changes , we will remain a nation of sick people paying way too much for healthcare that is ineffective .\nAction Alert !\nWrite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign on to the letter asking the FDA to protect consumer access to compounded bioidentical hormones .\nPlease send your message immediately

is working on a policy that will make it easier for the FDA to target and eliminate supplements like some forms of vitamin D from the market .\nWe need to make sure this bad idea does not become law .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with less severe COVID-19 outcomes and better survival among frail elderly populations .\nReviews looking at all of the evidence so far found that higher blood concentrations of vitamin D are associated with reduced risk and severity of COVID-19 .\nThe data reviewed also supports the role of higher blood vitamin D concentrations in reducing risk of infection

mandatory supplement filing \u201d requirement that is percolating around Congress .\nThis policy would create a database of all supplements on the market , potentially including product names , the list of ingredients in each supplement , labels , and additional filings for changes , reformulations , or discontinuations .\nThe mandatory filing could also require that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registration number , which would delay new products coming to the market .\nWe are now hearing there are indeed active conversations on Capitol Hill about this policy , and indeed there are draft bills that could be introduced at any moment .\nIn fact , Senator Durbin ( D-IL ) has been pursuing this policy for years .\nHe has introduced bills in the past to require mandatory filing for supplements ( for example in 2012 and 2013 ) , and recently tried to sneak it through the appropriations process .\nPart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how innocuous it sounds : who could be against a simple list of all the supplements currently on the market ?\nThe problem is that this list would likely be used by the FDA to target supplements that don \u2019 t comply with some of the agency \u2019 s ridiculous rules .\nWe recently described how resveratrol , a critical antioxidant , could be threatened by the passage of a mandatory filing requirement because the agency has stated that it does not meet the definition of a supplement .\nThe agency has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antioxidant , and CBD oil , do not meet the definition of a supplement .\nIf the agency decides it wants to remove these products from the market , all it needs to do is consult the list created by the \u201c mandatory filing \u201d requirement for a roadmap and easy elimination .\nIn fact , many , many supplements are at risk if the FDA gets the mandatory filing rules it wants .\nRecall the agency \u2019 s \u201c new supplement \u201d guidance that we have covered many times over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatens as many as 41,700 supplements .\nThe problem is that many supplements currently on the market , potentially even some basic products like vitamin D , could actually be considered \u201c new supplements \u201d by the FDA and thus targets for elimination if they don \u2019 t comply with the FDA \u2019 s rules .\nFor example , the FDA may conclude that some vitamin D supplements have been \u201c chemically altered \u201d from older versions and thus subject to the additional regulatory requirements .\nThere are already indications that some vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d because there have been \u201c new

that are not compliant with the \u201c new supplement \u201d guidance that much easier .\nOf course , we don \u2019 t know what the FDA would target first .\nThe above-mentioned threats to resveratrol , CBD , and vitamin D are hypothetical at this juncture .\nBut it is almost certain that the FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target something : why else , given the sterling safety record of dietary supplements , would Senator Dick Durbin , who has demonstrated himself to be anti-supplement many times , pursue this policy ?\nWe will continue to closely monitor the situation and update you accordingly .\nIn the

dominant site where the virus replicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRather than widely disseminating this important public health information , the FTC and the FDA are ruthlessly banning this information and taking these companies to court to silence them .\nThe CDC , whose mission is to increase the \u201c health security \u201d of our nation , has flatly refused to advise Americans to use nasal rinses despite the mountain of evidence showing they work .\nThis highlights everything wrong with our healthcare system .\nWhat kinds of claims were these companies making that required the government to clamp down ?\nXlear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xylitol , saline , and grapefruit seed extract , was censored by the FTC for simply discussing the results of more than a dozen studies demonstrating the plausibility of using its nasal spray to help with COVID .\nThese studies show that Xlear destroyed 99.9 percent of the SARS-CoV-2 virus , that xylitol blocks the adhesion of bacteria and viruses , including SARS-CoV-2 , to human tissue , and that the use of nasal sprays for COVID decreases viral activity in the nasal pathway , prevents transmission , expedites recovery , decreases disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMight this be useful information for the government to share with us during a global pandemic , with viral variants continually popping up and throwing vaccine effectiveness into question ?\nUndoubtedly , but the FTC has attempted to ban the company from sharing this information .\nIn fact , the FTC has sued Xlear for refusing to take down the \u201c unsupported \u201d health claims from its website that it \u2019 s nasal sprays can prevent or treat COVID , showing just how far the government will go to throttle natural options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine industry profits .\nNot only has the federal government prevented these companies from disseminating this scientifically supported information ; they have refused requests to alert the public themselves .\nPrimary care physicians and pulmonologists have petitioned the CDC to issue guidance on the use of nasal sprays to blunt the virus \u2019 s impact .\nThe CDC didn \u2019 t budge .\nWhat is galling about the government \u2019 s actions here is that , for many months at the beginning of the pandemic , there were no other options .\nGiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and saline are remarkably safe , why not share this information ?\nWhen the available evidence suggests that these products can help , they are safe , and there aren \u2019 t other solutions , it is lunacy not to share this information .\nThe FTC is also censoring health information about povidone iodine , another ingredient in nasal sprays and mouthwashes .\nA randomized clinical trial found that a povidone iodine mouthwash , gargle , and nasal spray significantly reduced the viral load in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 30 seconds can prevent the virus from attaching to oral and nasal tissues .\nFor these reasons , iodine has been

Alliance recommends a twice daily antiseptic mouthwash that includes povidone iodine , cetylpyridinium chloride , and essential oils .\nAn iodine-containing nasal spray is also a plausible prophylactic based on the above evidence .\nThis is all part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making COVID-19 health claims .\nThe FTC and FDA assert that these companies violated federal law simply by describing the studies showing how nasal irrigation can help with COVID , and only drugs that are FDA-approved can claim to prevent , treat , or mitigate a disease .\nAs we \u2019 ve explained before , FDA-approval requires randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , which are incredibly expensive .\nDrug companies can afford them because their drugs are patentable , and the research costs can be recouped once the drug gets approved .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the companies can not afford the astronomical sums required for RCTs .\nThe point isn \u2019 t that nasal sprays are a magic COVID bullet .\nThe point is that , during a pandemic , the government should embrace an \u201c all of the above \u201d approach to a novel public health problem , informing the public about safe therapies that can plausibly be expected to help .\nIt is lunacy to expect us to wait for clinical trials before a medicine is recommended for COVID .\nThe truth seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t a vaccine , the government

Corruption", "content": "A new book describes how Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2019 s actions during the AIDS and COVID crises exemplify everything wrong with our crony medical system .\nLearn how to get a free copy of this incredible book !\nDuring both the COVID pandemic and the AIDS epidemic , Dr. Fauci discredited medicines that are safe , cheap , and effective in favor of dangerous , expensive , and ineffective treatments that make billions for drug companies and enrich the government cronies that steer them through approval .\nIn both cases , Dr. Fauci showed a dogged determination to ignore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit of Big Pharma windfalls , costing hundreds of thousands of lives .\nDr. Fauci has a unique role in shaping US policy toward pandemics .\nSince 1984 he has served as head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ( NIAID ) , a health department with over $ 6 billion in annual funding .\nDr. Fauci wields incredible influence and power over NIAID , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , and other agencies in the US Department of Health and Human Services .\nYet the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during pandemics with Dr. Fauci holding the reins .\nFrom the very beginning of the current pandemic , Dr. Fauci led the way in denouncing hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) , an off-patent malaria drug , and , later , ivermectin , a drug to treat river blindness .\nBoth drugs exhibited great promise in fighting COVID , as we \u2019 ve discussed previously .\nBut to Dr. Fauci , they represented a grave threat : any recognition by federal agencies that HCQ , ivermectin , or any other set of repurposed drugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emergency use authorizations ( EUAs ) for the COVID vaccines in which HHS had invested heavily , since EUA \u2019 s are only granted when there are no other viable therapeutics for a disease .\nSo , whatever the evidence said , there was a vested interest on the part of the government to downplay and discredit HCQ and ivermectin .\nAs early as March 2020 , a paper was published discussing the mechanism by which HCQ inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 virus ; there was also a clinical report on the successful use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in fact been aware for years that HCQ was effective against viruses .\nBy April 2020 , doctors in the US widely prescribed HCQ .\nIn May , a comprehensive study of HCQ and COVID was published , stating that the evidence for HCQ is \u201c unequivocal.\n\u201d In August 2020 , Dr. Peter McCullough and his colleagues published their protocol for early outpatient treatment of COVID , which includes HCQ and ivermectin ; studies that utilized this approach showed an 85 percent reduction in mortality .\nThere was compelling evidence early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with HCQ and other compounds like zinc could save lives .\nWhat did the government do with this data ?\nIn March 2020 , Dr. Fauci denounced HCQ , stating that there was only \u201c anecdotal evidence \u201d of its benefit and that it should only be used in clinical trials .\nThat same month , Big Pharma donated , at the government \u2019 s request , 63 million doses of HCQ to the Strategic National Stockpile .\nClinical trials testing HCQ \u2019 s effectiveness against COVID were designed to fail : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s success , used it to treat severely ill COVID patients rather than for early treatment , and administered murderously high dosage levels of the drug .\nIn May , Dr. Fauci hailed two papers as the \u201c nail in the coffin \u201d of HCQ\u2014though it later came out that these papers were based on fraudulent data from Surgisphere , leading to retractions .\nNevertheless , in June 2020 , the FDA revoked the EUA that allowed HCQ from the Strategic National Stockpile to be used on hospitalized COVID patients .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System in Michigan published a study showing positive effects for HCQ ; Dr. Fauci said the results were \u201c flawed \u201d and that health officials should instead rely on evidence from randomized controlled trials .\nOn the back of these actions , governors in 33 states moved to restrict prescribing or dispensing of HCQ .\nPharmacists refused orders for HCQ from physicians .\nIn June , the FDA blocked access to the 63 billion doses of HCQ in the strategic stockpile .\nIvermectin was similarly smeared and discredited by Dr. Fauci and medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an effective COVID medicine .\nIn January of 2021 , doctors from the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance ( FLCCC ) , who were early champions of repurposed medicines in their protocols , testified before Congress , saying that the early use of HCQ and ivermectin could have saved 500,000 lives .\nFLCCC doctors were even able to convince the National Institutes of Health to change their recommendation on ivermectin from a negative to a neutral stance ; Freedom of Information Act requests revealed that three members of the NIH \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMerck was in fact getting ready to bring a novel COVID antiviral pill , molnupiravir , to market that would cost $ 700 .\nThe drug is similar to ivermectin , but unlike ivermectin there were safety concerns expressed by the scientists who developed the molnupiravir .\nIvermectin was widely used across the world .\nOne study showed that countries in which ivermectin was used widely to combat parasitic diseases experienced some of the world \u2019 s lowest case and mortality rates from COVID .\nOnce again , faced with overwhelming evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients , Dr. Fauci and the government stonewalled .\nIn March 2021 , the FDA and the WHO issued statements advising against ivermectin \u2019 s use .\nIn June 2021 , the Health Department struck a deal with Merck to buy $ 1.2 billion worth of molnupiravir .\nThen the real campaign against ivermectin began in earnest .\nIn August 2021 , the CDC ordered doctors to stop prescribing ivermectin .\nIn September , the American Medical Association and the American Pharmacists Association called on doctors to stop prescribing the drug .\nMolnupiravir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of November 2021 .\nNote , again , that an EUA would not have been possible for this drug if it was acknowledged that ivermectin or HCQ were effective for the treatment of COVID .\nAdmitting the efficacy of HCQ and ivermectin would have also threatened the financial success of remdesivir , Dr. Fauci \u2019 s main pharmaceutical gambit for COVID .\nThis is a drug that shows little to no clinical efficacy against COVID , yet was trumpeted by Dr. Fauci as the \u201c new standard of care \u201d for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete with vaccines , since the drug was for late-stage COVID disease and required hospitalization to administer .\nAnd again , admitting the clinical benefits of ivermectin and HCQ would make it impossible for remdesivir to get an EUA .\nIt would also threaten the demand for the drug : if fewer patients are sick because they used HCQ and ivermectin early , then there is less of a need for a late-stage COVID drug .\nThe tragedy is that this scenario is eerily similar to the AIDS crisis that Dr. Fauci presided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was only one drug that was ready to test , azidothymidine ( AZT ) , a drug that was shelved because it was ineffective against cancer and was extremely toxic .\nIn 1985 , AZT was found to kill HIV in vitro , leading the Pharma company that owned it , Burroughs Wellcome ( BW ) , to take it from the trash heap , patent it , and price it at $ 10,000 per year , the most expensive drug in the world at the time .\nUnder Dr. Fauci \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran the trials meant to evaluate AZT and were on key selection committees which decided what priority to give to testing AZT \u2019 s competitors .\nDr. Fauci waved the normal procedure of testing AZT in animals and allowed human trials to start ( in fact , he did the same thing for the COVID vaccines and allowed remdesivir trials in which there was no real placebo ) .\nBut development of AZT as an AIDS drug stalled due to its toxicity and the inability of researchers to design trials to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving promising results with AIDS patients using mixtures of off-label drugs .\nWith no other treatment options , even after millions of taxpayer dollars poured into AZT research , AIDS patients and doctors asked Dr. Fauci and the NIH to release treatment guidelines for how doctors can use off-label medicines to treat the disease and to release a statement announcing that protocol as the standard of care to help patients afford treatment , since insurance companies would have to cover it .\nDr. Fauci declined , saying there were no RCTs supporting these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , Good Intentions : How Big Business And the Medical Establishment Are Corrupting the Fight Against AIDS ) .\nOf course , NIAID could have sponsored these clinical trials , but that would have threatened the progress of AZT as a blockbuster treatment .\nSome estimate that Dr. Fauci \u2019 s refusal to stand behind repurposed drugs that were helping patients cost 17,000 lives ; others estimate that , once the drug was finally approved , it was so toxic that it killed 330,000 between 1987 and 2019 .\nThe similarities between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In both cases , the government used taxpayer dollars to develop drugs it handed off to Big Pharma .\nGovernment cronies like Dr. Fauci then rigged the game in favor of expensive , dangerous , ineffective treatments while simultaneously throttling access to natural medicines and off-patent drugs that are effective but limit profits .\nThese are issues we \u2019 ve discussed countless times over the years , and it is a system we strive to reform .\nA new book by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , The Real Anthony Fauci , stunningly recounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleak picture of our crony medical system .\nIt is a difficult but extremely important book to read , and we are making it

"Tips for choosing non-toxic toys for your family and friends this holiday season .\n\u2018 Tis the season !\nWith so many choices , it can be difficult to select gifts that satisfy our family and loved ones but are also free of dangerous ingredients and contaminants .\nIt is important to do your due diligence as a consumer , since our system for ensuring toy safety is mostly reactive\u2014toys aren \u2019 t tested for safety before they come on the market .\nEducation and vigilance can help keep your family and friends safe this holiday season .\nSmart toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys that can speak to a child , play music , and perform a variety of other functions .\nBut there are also risks , like data being collected on a child , a hacker gaining access through a Bluetooth connection , children being exposed to inappropriate content , or a toy having the capability of recording information about your home and family .\nOne karaoke microphone Bluetooth toy doesn \u2019 t require any pin code or verification to connect , which means that anyone within a certain radius can pair their phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice recording telling a child to come outside .\nHackers could use the toy to talk to other smart devices like Amazon Alexa .\nWireless headphones are becoming increasingly popular , but there are reasons to be concerned about the health effects they can cause .\nWe \u2019 ve written before about the health dangers associated with the radiation emitted from cell phones .\nWireless headphones emit a similar type of radiation to cell phones ( though generally at a lower power ) , and they are designed to be positioned in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain .\nNote that cell phone manuals usually instruct users to keep phones away from your head when using them .\nWhat makes wireless headphones concerning , then , is their positioning ( right next to the brain ) and the cumulative exposure time\u2014it is becoming common for people to have wireless headphones in their ears for almost the entire day .\nRegularly using wireless headphones is substantially increasing our overall exposure to harmful radiation .\nLead in toys is unfortunately still something to watch out for .\nThe use of lead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banned , so this heavy metal can still be found in toys produced in the US , not to mention toys produced outside the US .\nBy law , toys produced in the US are not allowed to have a concentration of lead greater than 90 parts per million ( ppm ) in surface coatings and no more than 100 ppm in total lead content .\nKeep in mind , though , that there is no safe level of lead exposure .\nTo avoid lead in toys , experts advise not to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys from discount shops or private vendors unless you can be absolutely sure they do not contain lead .\nCostume jewelry should not be given to young children .\nConsult recall lists to be sure you haven \u2019 t bought any toy recalled for lead .\nPhthalates are chemicals used to soften plastics .\nAs with lead , the government has set permissible levels of certain phthalates in children \u2019 s toys at 0.1 percent rather than banning them outright .\nThese chemicals come with a long list of risks : they \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breast cancer , obesity , type II diabetes , low IQ , neurodevelopmental issues , behavioral issues , and altered reproductive development .\nA recent study found that children exposed to phthalates before birth and shortly after had reduced lung function at 6 and 12 years old .\nPhthalates are known endocrine disruptors that can have profound effects on (

@ time show scary levels of phthalates in a wide variety of products .\nYou can also email a toy company directly to see if their products contain PVC or phthalates .\nAside from toys , it \u2019 s best to use glass and stainless steel instead of plastic for water bottles , storage containers , and baby bottles .\nBisphenols are used to make hard , mostly transparent plastics .\nMany consumers are familiar with BPA and the health problems , like endocrine disruption , with which this chemical has been associated .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ products being \u201c BPA-free , \u201d but as we \u2019 ve reported elsewhere , BPA is often replaced with another bisphenol that is just as dangerous .\nIt can be difficult to avoid bisphenols altogether unless you avoid all plastic toys , but certain precautions can be taken .\nYou can choose toys made of alternative materials like responsibly sourced wood .\nRecycle plastic toys that look worn or when the clear plastic becomes cloudy ; avoid placing plastic toys for extended periods of time in the sun or in heat .\nTry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys in their mouths .\nAvoid products marked with a 1 or a 7 recycle symbol and try to opt for containers marked with 2 , 4 , or 5 to avoid bisphenols .\nFormaldehyde is a carcinogen that can be found in some children \u2019 s products , such as toys made of composite wood that contain adhesives that release this chemical ; it can be used in products to achieve wrinkle resistance , so if a toy \u2019 s label makes this claim investigate how it is achieved .\nTo avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than composite wood , choose organic fabrics for dolls , and buy water-based paints rather than oil based paints for kids , as acrylic paints can give off formaldehyde .\nPFAS , referred to as \u201c forever chemicals \u201d since they persist in the environment and accumulate in the human body , are used in a wide array of consumer products , including clothes in order to make them waterproof and stain resistant .\nAs we \u2019 ve reported previously , PFAS are associated with a wide range of negative health effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with fetuses , kidney disease , and more .\nCheck clothing labels for the presence of Teflon or Gore-Tex , which can signal the presence of PFAS .\nFlame retardants are chemicals that are added to products to prevent fires .\nThey have been added to children \u2019 s pajamas since the 1970 \u2019 s when rules were written requiring them to either pass certain flammability tests or be tight fitting .\nTo comply , manufacturers began adding flame
